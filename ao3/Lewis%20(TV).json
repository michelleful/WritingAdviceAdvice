The door opened and Jean appeared in front of James, her shoulder length hair tucked behind her ears, her face without make-up, clearly tired from lack of sleep. \u201cHi, I thought I\u2019d pop around\u2026check on you.\u201d James smiled towards her.\u201cCome on in.\u201dJean stepped aside to allow James inside and quietly closed the door behind her; she followed him through to her front room to see him leaning over the basinet by the window, Hope staring up at him as she cried. Jean came up beside him, running a hand through her hair as he looked at her.\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d He stated, his arm coming around her, pulling her towards him.\u201cShe won\u2019t stop crying, colic.\u201dJames leaned in and lifted Hope and held her close to his chest and rocked her back and forth gently, Jean gave him a kiss on the cheek before leaving to make them some tea. He took a seat on the couch as he began to sing softly to her, the cries became softer and eventually eased as Hope began to close her eyes as James continued to sing softly. He looked up when Jean came back and set two cups down on the coffee table before sitting down next to James.\u201cYou\u2019re a natural with her.\u201d\u201cHey, it will get easier.\u201d James said, taking hold of her hand.\u201cWill it, I haven\u2019t slept in three days James\u2026I\u2019m so tired. I miss my work, I miss being in control.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not been easy on you I know.\u201d\u201cI just still can\u2019t quite believe all this has happened, eight weeks ago everything was normal, and everything was heading in the right direction. I\u2019d signed my divorce papers, my job as Chief Super was going from strength to strength and then hours later I\u2019m in the hospital with you by my side giving birth to a child I didn\u2019t even know I was carrying.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026James got up and placed Hope back in the basinet before sitting back down beside Jean and wrapped his arm around her as she leaned in and lay her head on his chest.\u201cYou heard what the doctor said when she was born, lots of women can go a whole pregnancy without realising they\u2019re even pregnant.\u201d He placed a soft kiss to her head as she moved closer.\u201cI\u2019m not just any woman James; I\u2019m Chief Superintendent for god sake.\u201d\u201cEven you can make a mistake you know, you\u2019re human.\u201d\u201cI honestly can\u2019t thank you enough for being there for me and not just in the hospital when Hope was born, but after too.\u201d\u201cWhat about Andrew, he is Hope\u2019s father.\u201d\u201cJames, Andrew wants nothing to do with her. He\u2019s happy with Jessica now and he said he doesn\u2019t want to mess that up.\u201d\u201cHe said that, some men don\u2019t deserve to be fathers.\u201dJean looked up when she heard the hurt in James voice; she leaned up and kissed him, running her hand down his cheek.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak much about your family.\u201d\u201cWe weren\u2019t close; my father wasn\u2019t the most maternal man in the world. He worked hard; we never really spoke much if I\u2019m honest.\u201d\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d\u201cLeft when I was six, I don\u2019t think children were ever really in her plan.\u201d\u201cJames I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be, I\u2019m happy now and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told Lewis about your parents?\u201d\u201cHow do you know I haven\u2019t?\u201d\u201cWe do talk you know, we both worry.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, never been the right time I suppose.\u201d\u201cHe does care about you.\u201d\u201cI know he does.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been more of a father to me that my own father ever was that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cYou should tell him that, I think he\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d\u201cYou think so.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cYou make it easy to talk about this, I feel like I can tell you anything.\u201d\u201cYou can tell me anything James\u2026I\u2019m always here, just like you\u2019ve been for me.\u201d\u201cI still am, I meant what I said at the hospital Jean. We\u2019re all here for you, anytime\u2026especially me.\u201dShe looked up at him as he leaned down and kissed her, her arm lying across his stomach as she closed her eyes.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Jean woke up the next morning, feeling more alive than she had in days. She looked at the clock on the bedside cabinet and saw that it was nearly 9am. She sat up in confusion; she\u2019d slept for 8 hours straight. She got out of bed and quickly showered before slipping on a pair of jeans and blue blouse before walking through to the smell of bacon and toast. She smiled when she entered the kitchen to see James holding Hope in his arms, a bottle in his hand as he fed her. He looked up to see Jean standing in the doorway watching him, looking more like the old Jean Innocent.\u201cOh hi, morning.\u201d He smiled.\u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, this daughter of yours was getting a little hungry so I thought it best to feed her.\u201dJean came over to them and leaned up and kissed James before taking Hope in her arms and taking over breakfast duty. She took a seat at the table as James began buttering some toast and placing bacon on the plate before sitting it down in front of Jean.\u201cBreakfast ma\u2019am.\u201d He smiled, taking a seat beside her.\u201cEnough of the ma\u2019am thank you.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dWhen Hope was finished eating, James took her and began to burp her while Jean ate her breakfast.\u201cSo, how did you sleep?\u201d he asked.\u201cThe best sleep I\u2019ve had in weeks, speaking of which\u2026how exactly did I get to bed.\u201d\u201cI carried you.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI did try to wake you but well, you were so tired and I didn\u2019t have the heart too.\u201d\u201cAnd how did I get in my night things?\u201d She said with a glint in her eye.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I kept my eyes closed the whole time, I swear.\u201d\u201cWell, thank you. I feel a lot better today and thank you for looking after Hope.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201dJean looked up at the clock then back to James before taking Hope.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late Sergeant.\u201d\u201cNope, I\u2019m not in until 11am.\u201d\u201cYou know, just because I\u2019m not in the office doesn\u2019t mean you can make your own hours.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unpaid leave, your replacement authorised it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s she like then?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s okay, she\u2019s not you. She\u2019s definitely more\u2026well\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026laid back.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that.\u201d\u201cOf course not, so she\u2019s popular then.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s liked, but then so are you? Stop being jealous, you\u2019ve nothing to worry about, she\u2019s not replacing you.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cDSI Dodson is just, she has her own ways of working, that\u2019s all. It doesn\u2019t mean we like you any less, you should meet her, you\u2019d like her.\u201d\u201cLooking like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel beautiful, I need a haircut\u2026I need to lose some weight.\u201d\u201cWill you stop, you only had a baby eight weeks ago, give yourself time. I have to go, can I come by later?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you later then.\u201dJames got up and kissed Hope\u2019s forehead before capturing Jean\u2019s lips, letting her know how much he felt for her.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026To Be Continued\u2026As you can see I\u2019ve introduced a new character, well not so much new if you watch Scott & Bailey and worship DSI Julie Dodson as I do xx"}, "Published:": "2015-08-28", "Category:": ["F/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Hits:": "49", "Summary": "\nA baby makes love stronger, the days shorter, the nights longer, savings smaller and a home happier.

They walked side by side along the streets, the rain never lifting as they stopped outside The Trout.\u201cCome on lad\u2026you\u2019re buying.\u201dJames smiled as he followed Robbie inside and went up to the bar as Robbie found them a table in the corner by the window. James ordered two beers and paid before joining Robbie at the table.\u201cThere you are Sir.\u201d\u201cCheers lad\u2026so what\u2019s your plans for the weekend.\u201d\u201cNot much Sir.\u201d\u201cOh come on, it\u2019s our first weekend off in over three months\u2026you must have something to do?\u201d\u201cNot really, I may catch up on my reading or try out some new material on my guitar.

James followed his gaze and saw the look on Jean\u2019s face.\u201cWho\u2019s that with Innocent?\u201d James asked.\u201cNot sure, but I think it might be her husband. I\u2019ve never actually met the man and he\u2019s never been with her a work events but I did over hear her arranging to meet him after work\u2026didn\u2019t sound too happy about it though.\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look happy.\u201d\u201cWell you\u2019ve heard the rumours.\u201d\u201cJust rumours though.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know lad\u2026.she\u2019s not been her self lately that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cI did notice\u2026man\u2019s a fool.\u201d\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t listen to rumours?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t but if it is true, I hope she takes him for everything he has.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Jean removed her wet coat and placed it behind her on the chair as she took a seat by the fire to dry off; she glanced over and spotted Robbie and James at the corner table and rolled her eyes. Off all the pubs in and around Oxford why did Richard insist on meeting up in this particular one? They never made eye contact so prayed they didn\u2019t notice her, the last thing she needed was more gossip floating around the station about the state of her marriage. Richard sat down in front of her, blocking her view of James and Robbie and set the red wine in front of her.\u201cThanks.\u201d She said, attempting but failing a smile his way.\u201cSo\u2026I got your papers.\u201d\u201cGood, have you signed them?\u201d\u201cGive me a chance, I only got them a few days ago.\u201d\u201cLong enough I would have thought.\u201d\u201cFor god sake Jean, surely we can be civil to one another.\u201d\u201cCivil, I\u2019ve been nothing but civil considering the shit you\u2019ve put me through\u2026not to mention our son.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring Chris in to this.\u201d\u201cAnd why the hell not, you\u2019ve embarrassed him just as much as me\u2026an eighteen year, seriously.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s wise beyond her years Jean.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hardly an excuse; she\u2019s a child for god sake. Was I really such a terrible wife that you had to rob the cradle.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Jean, your job comes first. It always has and it always will. I was the one who raised Chris while you went out working all the hours, never at home to even put him to bed.\u201d\u201cHow dare you, I worked all those hours so that you could do your business degree, I\u2019m the one who helped you out to set up your own business and now look at you, you run a million dollar company al thanks to me and how do you repay me, by sleeping around with a young girl barely out of school, you sicken me. Sign those papers as soon as, I want you out of my life.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026James and Robbie looked up as Jean stormed past them, trying her hardest to avoid their gaze, her face full of embarrassment as she rushed out the door. Richard was about to follow her out when Robbie stood up and blocked his way.\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d\u201cListen, best to let her calm down eh.\u201d\u201cAnd who the hell are you to tell me how to handle my wife.\u201d\u201cYour ex wife I believe.\u201d James added.\u201cNot yet pal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m DI Lewis and this is DS Hathaway, we work with Chief Super Innoc\u2026with Jean.\u201d\u201cDo I look like I could care less; now get out of my way.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave her be, let her calm down yeah.\u201dRobbie\u2019s hand was on Richard\u2019s arm, firmly holding him in place. He yanked his arm free before shaking his head and walking back over to the bar, ordering another drink.\u201cWell\u2026guess the rumours are true after all lad?\u201d Robbie stated.\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t listen to rumours.\u201d\u201cThe evidence is pretty clear.\u201dJames only smiled as Robbie decided it was time he was heading home to Laura.\u201cYou coming lad?\u201d\u201cI might go for a walk actually, clear my head.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pouring down.\u201d\u201cI like the rain Sir.\u201d\u201cAlright, have it your own way. Enjoy your weekend; don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try not to Sir.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026James waited a few minutes for Robbie to leave before he finished off his beer and left the pub. The rain was still coming down but lighter than before, he pulled the collar of his jacket up and began walking, he made his way down the path towards the canal, the river was always beautiful to look at in the night, the lights from the lamp posts shining on the water. As he walked along he looked up and saw his Chief Super standing near the edge a few feet away, her arms wrapped around herself protecting herself from the cold. She was a little too close to the edge for his liking as he made his way over to her.\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026are you alright.\u201dJean heard the soft voice of her Sergeant as she quickly wiped a few tears from her eyes, refusing to let him see her cry. \u201cAre you following me Sergeant?\u201d She said as she turned to him.\u201cNot at all, I just felt like a walk. I usually come down here to think.\u201d\u201cIn the rain?\u201d\u201cIt can be quite therapeutic.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201dJames moved a little closer, placing his hand on her arm as he gently brought her back from the edge of the canal. Jean gave him a confused look and saw the worry in his face.\u201cOh for god sake Hathaway, I wasn\u2019t going to jump in.\u201d\u201cSorry ma\u2019am I just\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a lot of things but suicidal isn\u2019t one of them, it\u2019ll take more than a cheating son of a bitch husband to get to me.\u201d\u201cYou are unhappy though, I\u2019ve been watching you.\u201d\u201cWatching me? Spying on me?\u201d\u201cNo ma\u2019am, just concerned.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me Hathaway.\u201d\u201cJames\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cCall me James.\u201d\u201cJames, well I was saying\u2026you don\u2019t need to be worried about me, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cWhy do you this.\u201d\u201cDo what.\u201d\u201cPretend.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not in the office now; you\u2019re not Chief Superintendent Innocent right now\u2026you\u2019re just Jean, whose husband has walked out on her for someone younger.\u201d\u201cYou are crossing a line Hathaway.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201dJean removed her arm from James grasp and began walking as the rain began to fall heavier again.\u201cJean please, wait.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026.what do you want me to say, that I\u2019m angry, upset, furious because he\u2019s decided that an eighteen year old is more appealing that the fifty-three year old wife, then fine I am. I am angry, I want to kill him for all the pain and hurt he\u2019s caused and not just to me but to our son and the humiliation he\u2019s caused me at work. Oh yes, I do know about all the gossip behind my back, I\u2019ve heard what they say, that\u2019s I\u2019m always working, that I\u2019ve let myself go, that it\u2019s no wonder he turned to someone younger\u2026how could anyone blame him. Well perhaps they\u2019re right, perhaps I did cause all this.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Jean felt tears falling freely as she spoke, turning and walking away from James. He stood for a few moments as he watched her walked up the path, his heart breaking for her. He brushed spots of rain from his face as he walked quickly to catch up with her, his hand coming to her elbow to stop her. She turned around; ready to reprimand him for grabbing her but was silence when she felt his warm lips touch hers, a soft moan escaping her lips as she felt his other hand make its way around her waist, pulling her closer to him. She found herself responding to the kiss as her hands came up his back as he slowly pulled back to look down at her, shock mixed with surprise on her face as her hair became flat from the rain. James ran a soft hand down her cheek as he focused only on her.\u201cYou are\u2026.a beautiful woman and you deserve to be treated a lot better than your husband has treated you. Don\u2019t regret all the hours you put in to your job, you made your way up the ranks to Chief Super through hard work and determination and you deserve the recognition for that. You shouldn\u2019t have to apologise for that, and especially not to him. You\u2019re one the best Chief Superintendents I have ever had the privilege of working for and hope to continue to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s more Chris than anything you know, god only knows what he\u2019s hearing from third parties.\u201d\u201cYou son is an intelligent young man, I don\u2019t believe for a second that he would believe gossip. You\u2019re his mother and he loves you, I guarantee he\u2019s just a furious with his father as you are. I very much doubt he blames you for any of it.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m almost certain of it.\u201dJean was suddenly aware that James hand was still firmly on her waist and it felt comfortable, right.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I kissed you like that, I didn\u2019t plan to it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright; it was a spur of the moment thing.\u201d Jean said.\u201cSomething like that, but I don\u2019t regret nor am I sorry I did it. Just remember you are a beautiful, intelligent, compassionate woman and you deserve more than your husband gave to you.\u201d\u201cThank you James, I\u2019m glad you were here tonight\u2026though I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t speak of this with anyone, not even DI Lewis.\u201d\u201cOf course Jean, our secret. Can I walk you home?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026I\u2019d like that very much.\u201dJean slipped her arm through James arm as he escorted her home, no words needed to be spoken as the rain fell above them.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026-Fin"}}, "4673030": {"Chapters:": "1/1", "Words:": "977", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Keys", "Rating:": ["General Audiences"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway & Robert Lewis"], "Published:": "2015-08-28", "Category:": ["Gen"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Hits:": "114", "Kudos:": "12", "Summary": "\nSome people collected seashells, stamps, dolls, or car parts.

Robbie Lewis collected keys.Now, they weren\u2019t just any keys, mind. Each key was a specific memory, and each was dear to him. He had a key from his first house, and still had the key to the small house in Oxford where he\u2019d lived as a sergeant. Even though that key was filled with painful memories, it held pleasant ones as well.There was the spare key for the jag on his keyring still, even after having to sell it. Robbie had hated that day, still felt bitter about leaving an old friend behind. But he honestly thought that he was never coming back to England.But there was one key that he shouldn\u2019t have. It was a key that didn\u2019t even open anything special, just a three-bedroom semi, and not even that anymore. But it still held some of his fondest memories as a sergeant.Robbie tossed his keys at James. \u201cYou drive. I\u2019ve had one too many.\u201d Not necessarily true, but he was tired, and besides, it gave him a chance to tease his sergeant about his driving.James caught the keys deftly in his long-fingered hands and sorted through the variety of keys on the ring. \u201cChrist, how do you open your flat, Sir?\u201d\u201cI know me keys, James,\u201d Robbie replied with a hint of humor as James opened up the Vauxhall and he climbed in. \u201cHome, James.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d James took his time starting up the car; he was staring at a key that was different from the others. It was old, but not tarnished, though it had obviously seen use. And, unlike Robbie\u2019s other keys, it was pearlescent silver.Robbie knew James would never ask on his own. \u201cC\u2019mon, James. I woulda thought we were mates now, too.\u201dJames cleared his throat. \u201cUm\u2026the silver key\u2026\u201d\u201cWhich?\u201d\u201cThe car key is for the jaguar you used to have. I know that.\u201d James replied; even now, Robbie could smell the leather of the jag, mixed with his boss\u2019s cologne. \u201cThe house key, I mean. What\u2019s it to? You and Laura looking at houses without me?\u201d It was a joke, but the question was all too serious.\u201cMaybe we are, canny lad.\u201d Robbie teased easily back; the rapport was better now that he had the ease of experience. \u201cBut no, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s a key to Morse\u2019s house.\u201dJames stayed silent, eyes on the road, but he raised an eyebrow. Robbie noted that he missed the turning for the station; that alone told him his detail-oriented sergeant was interested in this story. So he settled in to tell it. Unlike stories of the house he shared with Val, memories of Morse\u2019s house were awash with warmth and companionship; odd for a man like Morse, but there it was. \u201cYeah, Morse was like that. A little weird, but you got used to it. He jes needed someone with a more patient temper and enough bravery to kick him in the teeth when he needed it.\u201d He chuckled, thinking of his not infrequent scraps with Morse. \u201cSo, how\u2019d you get his key?\u201d There was a dangerous glint in James\u2019s eye. \u201cIs there something you haven\u2019t told me, Sir?\u201dRobbie almost hit him playfully, but refrained. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t like that! Christ, we were married! No, it was\u2026Morse\u2019s way of opening up, letting me know he trusted me.\u201d\u201cStill an odd sort of gift.\u201d James commented. \u201cDid you ever actually use it?\u201d\u201cSurprisingly\u2026yeah.\u201d Robbie replied honestly, earning him another curious eyebrow. \u201cI was nervous at first, but after crossing the threshold, so to speak, it was easy. After all, I did know where Morse hid his spare. My coming into the house without him opening the door wasn\u2019t unheard of.\u201dJames seemed agog with this new information. \u201cAnd to think I\u2019d never have known if I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\u201cSmartarse.\u201d Robbie said fondly; James grinned.\u201cSo, was it only for business?\u201d James asked.Robbie barked a laugh. \u201cGod, no! We were friends, too, as unlikely as it was. If I needed a break from spring cleaning and the kids were off doing their own things, it was a safe haven. Morse kept himself to himself, but he was glad for company, I reckon.\u201dJames nodded, and Robbie could tell he had some verse or quote on his tongue, so he continued before James could say it.\u201cWe drank beer, chatted about things. He taught me a lot about music and literature. We joked about things. Morse didn\u2019t really have a gift for funny stories, but he had been with Thames Valley for a while. That was what it was called back in my day,\u201d he added for James\u2019s benefit. \u201cHe knew what me C.S. was like as a sergeant, even as a PC. He could be wickedly funny when he was in the mood. He had a sort of dry humor; you had to get used to it like everything else.\u201d\u201cI heard he was as mean as a rabid cat.\u201d James interjected.Robbie thought a minute about how best to answer that. \u201cHe could be. He was impatient, and could be rude and stubborn as anything when he got his teeth in something. But I don\u2019t think he wanted to hurt me feelings on purpose. He needed an outlet when he was mad, and that cut me up a bit, but deep down, he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201dJames nodded. The station was now in sight. \u201cThank you for telling me, Sir.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it opens the house now\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo. The house changed hands after Morse died. First his kin, then others.\u201d James hummed, and Robbie could tell he was interested. \u201cNow that\u2019s a story for another day, clever clogs.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cNow, give us back our keys.\u201d"}}, "4365545": {"Chapters:": "32/?", "Words:": "36303", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Jean Innocent", "Robert Lewis", "Laura Hobson", "Lizzie Maddox", "CS Joe Moody", "Other Character Tags to Be Added"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "One For Sorrow - Magpies and Bells", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Text": {"1": "\nChapter Text\n\nThis came to me as I re-watched a few episodes and happened to run across a few hints dropped for the new season.

Thanks for reading.\n\u00a0One for sorrow,Two for joy,Three for a girl,Four for a boy,Five for silver,Six for gold,Seven for a secret,Never to be told.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 DI Hathaway stood in the alley car-park indulging in his favored vice looking up at the sign painted with a single magpie watching him with the bright glass eye someone had\u00a0glued to the wood. His own\u00a0eyes throbbed with the discontent in his heart. He knew this was coming. Of course they would marry and who else would Robert ask to be his best man?\n\n He\u2019d done the polite thing. He always did. He\u2019d pretended joy and smiled and kissed Laura\u2019s cheek and put on a great stonking show of how pleased he was for Robert. He\u2019d teased him for taking so long and told Laura that she should be sainted for her patience with the thicky Geordie lot.\n\nLaura was beaming. Innocent teared up then cast a furtive glance at him that conveyed with a single tilt of her head that he\u2019d never fooled her and he detested her for a split second as he felt her unspoken pity wash him in understanding at his sorrow. \n\nIt was over. He had no option but to face that Robert would never choose four for a boy over the three for a girl. Robbie\u2019s heart was closed to the obviously pathetic hopes that one day James would be more than a best man and somehow morph into a great love requited. James sucked the smoke deep into his lungs and held it, willing the poison to destroy him faster. \n\nThe bells of Oxford rang in the distance and James closed his eyes to listen. Great Tom chimed in, calling him eight times to duty and death and prayer and a wedding. For his sorrow and secrets he thought with a wounded smirk touching his expression. Innocent was standing a few feet away when the ringing ceased, finally prompting him to open his eyes. \n\n\u201cIs there anything I can do, James?\u201d she asked with timid voice overflowing with kindness. \n\nJames took another deep drag and sighed a billow of smoke into the night air. He shook his head and tossed the fag away only to light another. \u201cNo. Really, thanks, but can we just pretend you are already retired and let the case of you always being in the know go cold this one time?\u201d\n\nShe stepped closer and put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat depends. Can you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t any choice. He made his. Please, Ma\u2019am. Let this go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure he knew the options? Have you ever actually told him?\u201d Jean asked softly.\n\n\u201cSeven for a secret, never to be told,\u201d James responded. \u201cOne and seven \u2013 those are my numbers. Two and four avoid me\u2026always..\u201d\n\nThey both turned at the sound of footsteps and a banging door. \u201cThere you are? The two of you in a dark alley. I fear for me life. Am I interrupting a clandestine tryst?\u201d Robbie Lewis said then chuckled at both of the aghast expressions that greeted him. \n\n\u201cAhh, so either I\u2019ve hit the nail on the head or you were scheming about me. No Stag do. I\u2019m too old for that nonsense, \u201c Robbie cheerfully admonished.\n\n\u201cDamned, Thwarted by the best, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like a tryst is so farfetched, Mr. Lewis. I am a free agent these days, you know. There is a certain charm in the whole cougar mentality,\u201d Jean deadpanned.\n\n\u201cGood thing you arrived in time to save my virtue. Ta for that.\u201d James added sincerely enough that Jean slapped his arm. \n\nRobbie\u2019s eyebrows rose in mock shock and he pointed back toward the door. \u201cHalf the nick is in there debating where one or the other of you have disappeared to. I could set their minds to ease if you like? Tell them my work wife is out here bucking for a promotion with the Chief? Make for your last few weeks to be rather exciting, I\u2019d imagine. Be the talk of the station until the day James follows us into the great pensioner\u2019s mist.\u201d \n\n\u201cAs attractive as the center of untoward office gossip sounds, I\u2019d hoped for a more discreet sort of arrangement for the end of my shining career. A dignified exit is more my style. Tempting as it would be to allow the former Mr. Innocent to catch wind that a certain tall blond half of the dynamic duo set his sights on my person, I would find it annoying to bury James\u2019 career in the bogs after you put such effort into housetraining him. No matter how sweet the revenge.\u201d Innocent responded in her most superior voice. \n\nJames grinned and winked at Robbie. \u201cCamera phone. sir.\u201d\n\nRobbie looked confused then seemed to catch on with a sly grin. He brought up his phone and nodded.\n\nJames moved toward Jean with a sure smile and took her in his arms as if he knew every inch of her. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Hathaway?\u201d Jean demanded.\n\n\u201cJust cutting out the middle man. Let the bastard squirm, Ma\u2019am. Ready, Robbie?\u201d James asked, never talking his eyes off Jean.\n\nJames\u2019 hand cupped her cheek and his eyes half-closed as he tilted his head and met her lips in a perfect Hollywood-romantic kiss. The alley saw three bright flashes before James pulled back with a smirk and whispered, \u201cNow think what would happen if that was a glossy eight by ten on your office door tomorrow morning and look at Robert as if we just got caught!\u201d\n\nJean looked horrified and the image Robbie captured would have made knees wobble had Jean Innocent truly been the subject of a scandal. \n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Robbie said and showed the subjects their work with a conspiratorial chuckle. \n\nJean\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cAgain. What the hell do you think you are doing?\u201d\n\nRobbie answered, \u201cNot a damned thing, Ma\u2019am. At least not without your word.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust thought Mr. Innocent should know that you are not sitting at home pining for him. That he\u2019s lost the best thing that ever happened to him and it\u2019s not even a blip on your radar.\u201d James kissed her on the cheek and shrugged with a shy smile and twinkling eyes.\n\n\u201cMoved on to bigger and certainly prettier things.\u201d Robbie added.\n\n\u201cBit of a childish plan, but you don\u2019t have many opportunities to kick a true narcissist, unless you know what they care about.\u201d James volunteered with a casual superior tone. \n\nRobbie chimed in, \u201cSaw him out to dinner last week. She\u2019s hideous, if I may be so bold. Too much make-up and chews gum like a \u2026well, at least she\u2019s out of nappies.\u201d \n\nJean stood silently considering her options. The boys awaited her orders. A huge naughty grin spread across her face. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake. I am glad you two are my friends. Yes. Do that and then keep mum. Conclusions are always more salacious than facts in my experience. Though, Hathaway, if this goes wrong, it will all be on your shoulders. Are you sure you can stand the implications? Robbie and I won\u2019t be there to protect you if this goes pear shaped down the road. He might use it against me to try to embarrass me.\u201d\n\nJames smirked and replied, \u201cI think it will be more fun than the whispers that I am dangerously heartbroken over my former governor\u2019s impending nuptials. I\u2019d be happy to frame it and put it on my desk. Sleeping my way to the top seems more romantic than a pathetic sod topping himself over unrequited gay love, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nA look passed between Jean and Robbie. They should have found the comment hilarious. So, they both had heard the bloody rumors too. Some were a razor\u2019s edge from the truth. Bit of a surprise, Robbie not being the gossip-whisperer. James wondered if Laura had filled him in on the whispered water-cooler chinwag circling the Nick like buzzards.\n\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\nLizzy took it upon herself to keep him apprised of such matters, particularly when he was the subject. It had become a routine, presented as matter of fact as his morning coffee. \u201cSir, I was just rather rudely informed that if I value my life, that I should request transfer. Seems there was a \u2018Lethal Weapon\u2019 marathon on this weekend and you are about to go Riggs on us all. Should I mention that I am too old for this shit?\u201d She\u2019d teased.\n\n\u201cGood advice. You got the short stick when you drew your lot for Gov\u2019nor. It was my winning smile and compassionate warmth that drew you in to the lion\u2019s den,\u201d James said in bored deadpan, never looking up from his computer. \n\nLizzy gave him a roll of the eyes and a mirthful snort as she plopped his coffee down. \u201cMore like your Guv begging me not to leave you and CS Innocent\u2019s generous offer of hazard pay. I needed the extra cash\u2026Sir.\u201d She had gotten quite nimble at taking the piss with him, no longer terrified of his cool mask or his gruff bearing. \n\n She had dismissed it with a laugh, but it wasn\u2019t a completely false assessment. He was testing fate here and there. Every time he took one of those little life risks, Robbie noticed, then pretended it didn\u2019t happen. When he had stood at the edge of the woods, daring a sniper with an easy shot, it was a test. It was followed by his reckless frustration of the others caution when he just went to confront what he thought might be a wounded armed hunter turned fugitive in a hole. The scary woodsman happened to be dead, but James had heard and ignored Robert\u2019s warning as he called his name, voice two octaves higher thanks to stress. Robbie knew but he couldn\u2019t see. Now he was dogging the path and James had just thrown a blood trail right to his own heart.\n\nJames had admitted it all in his own way to other people.\n\n\u201cWhat a lot you know?\u201d Phillipa said after he\u2019d decided she really wasn\u2019t the killer because he\u2019d given her perfect opportunity to prove she could be. She could have offed him in the library. She could have invited him home and set him on fire which of course wouldn\u2019t be very original, but neither was arsenic poisoning, unfortunately, or getting shot, stabbed or locked in an air tight space and left to suffocate. Good times, indeed. \n\n\u201cNot about the important stuff,\u201d he\u2019d tossed back without explaining. She was a mirror not a potential friend. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know the things he wanted to know the most, like how to make an older Geordie copper fall for him rather than the beautiful, brilliant and safe as houses, Laura Hobson. No, James understood more about a person in a hopeless love than he could admit to Philippa Garwood. That meant he could not abide the fact that someone so full of wisdom could be as stupid as he himself was. \n\nCon to Don, Simon Flaxmore even had the loyalty and undivided love of his devoted employee, and she got her man, yet James could not get his. Ironic really, he\u2019d always tried so hard to do what was right and he found it to be the path of destruction yet here he still stood, a peregrino on the Camino in search of forgiveness. \n\nHis first time at Robbie and Laura\u2019s home after his promotion had been a special treat. \n\n\u201cNot going to be one of his voyage-of-discovery meals is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? What do you discover?\u201d Lizzy asked.\n\n\u201cUsually that you\u2019re not very hungry.\u201c \n\nRobbie knew then. He\u2019d wanted to talk to James.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing has more strength than dire necessity.\u201d James had blurted.\n\nAnd Robbie had understood in some way. He had. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that, man.\u201d\n\n But, the girls had made sure things were kept on the upbeat. \u201cYou two finished yacking?\u201d\n\nAnd Robbie responded cryptically, \u201cNot for a long time.\u201d \n\nIt was true. They had not made time to sit together and not talk to their hearts content for ages. There was always work, and Laura and Lizzy and his own moody cheek bordering on belligerence getting in the way. That was his fault. He couldn\u2019t face it all. James got past that lovely night of bonding by closing off and playing the polite guest, not for his sake, but for theirs. His friends? His heart was in agony watching the domestic comfort he would never know. Not something he could share with Robert even if they\u2019d made the time. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuke 8:6- Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.\n\n\nHe was happy for them. He tried very hard to be anyway. Did it have to include his mind being filled with images of innocent kisses and sweet touches parading all for his torment? It wasn\u2019t a surprise that Jean could figure it all out. It was a surprise and maybe a letdown that the man he adored beyond all reason was so painfully oblivious. \n\nHe\u2019d really ramped up his game on the Lawrie case. Pushing the man to focus away from Lewis and onto him, or so he\u2019d thought. Traipsing all over Oxford as the only copper attempting a trip to the loo alone these days. Orders were, only in pairs. Sent Robbie and Lizzy off together and they didn\u2019t notice him always solo. Didn\u2019t matter, he nearly got Lizzy killed egging the man on. Sent Lizzy to interview a mousy psychopath. \u00a0He\u2019d tried to let it be him caught out and taking the blow for the next guy but he was chasing the wrong absolute entirely. He grumbled at Lewis for not going with her but he was really just incredibly frustrated. \n\nHe dreamed of a crazed woman with a needle and the smell of crushed flowers like a funeral. He longed for to it have been the ending. Maybe a son, student and boyfriend would have been spared. If the needle had just gotten past the foam he would never have been on the next case to push Adam Tibbit and even if he\u2019d still ended up dead, it would not have been on James\u2019 soul.\n\nHe\u2019d prayed for them on The Way. All of them. Will, Silas, Adam, Briony, Jess Lake, A murdered little girl he\u2019d found too late in a cistern, Zo\u00eb Kenneth, all his burdens, old and new. He prayed for Vicky, so beautiful and frightened, who he had failed more than anyone, who in her last seconds had wanted the comfort of the words he could say by muscle memory alone, who held his hand so tight and to whom he had offered nothing. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d even prayed that sometimes science didn\u2019t know everything. \n\n\u201cEverything we are - love, hate, anger, jealousy, desire... \u201c\n\n\u201c Desire? \u201c His eyes had flicked guiltily to Robbie for a split second when Robbie had said the word out loud.\n\n\u201c Ah, the need for a mate whereby we can propagate our mitochondrial DNA. It's about as basic an instinct as you can get.\u201d \n\nHe asked, \u201cAnd the soul? \n\nDr. Joshua Ezrin looked at him like a wayward pupil, \u201cSorry, there is no ghost in the machine. When the machine stops, we stop.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to stop. That was a sin too, but he could not shake it. \n\n\u201cMoored. Horses are tethered; boats are moored.\u201d he\u2019d told Lewis. He wondered what the terms for untied souls could be other than damned. \n\n\n'Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream, merrily merrily merrily merrily, life is... ' somewhat repetitive.\n\n\n He walked a wobbly line with his soul, and he knew it. Intent carried as much weight as action. He could place the metaphorical noose around his own neck and still find peace but if he kicked the chair, it was damnation. \n\nHe could have happily gone years ago. If he\u2019d known the road ahead, he might have not fought that day of the crushed flowers. Oh not noticeably, just relaxed his arms enough to give her the edge. A centimeter of foam made it possible for Robbie to be able to tease him that he\u2019d have gone to see a psychic cat killer to have a word with James. If James would have died, he knew Robbie would have focused on conviction and been unable to speak his name for years. \n\nIt was so self-indulgent to remember seeing the fear in Robert\u2019s eyes. It had been rather bitter sweet. It meant Robert Lewis cared and yet it meant that James\u2019 last act would probably have destroyed the man he loved. \n\nSo when Robbie retired he\u2019d walked. He\u2019d gone all the way to Cruz de Fierro with a rock. He\u2019d scrawled \u2018Lewis\u2019 on the white stone and written on the back, \u2018I am not for you after all.\u2019 \n\nHe had put that burden on the pile of stones, prayed for his burden to be left behind and walked away. It didn\u2019t work and he\u2019d realized as he sat on the hill looking over Santiago that he could not ask for forgiveness when he went to the Cathedral. \n\n He was damned beyond salvage and so he had instead gone to the University and obtained as much information as he could on how to establish the post mortem interval (PMI) using the technique they developed. He\u2019d sent the information to Laura in an Email along with an invitation to call the professor with any questions or to visit in person if that were convenient.\n\nHe had been unable to send a single word to Robbie. Laura would tell him and together they would know his location and that he was a very long way from home. \n\nHe\u2019d then turned around and walked back the other way. He was no pilgrim, more like a Flagellant bleeding for his own never-ending sin of envy.\u00a0\u00a0 A thousand miles penance had not healed his soul but had just toughened his feet and his heart with callous. \n\nThey had been living together by the time he got back. \n\nHe ignored their calls and sat his exams. \n\nHe worked every waking hour looking for the next crazy with a needle full of Etorphine A heritage to good coppers is to end in valor. His legacy to Lewis and Morse and Thursday \u2013 to buy it in the line of duty and meet their souls with thanks. \n\n It would have been better if Robbie had not swooped in to save the day and called it \u2018taking a break from his retirement.\u2019 Robbie would have gotten one of those awful calls or Laura would have gotten a shout and come home to tell him gently. They would say how sorry they were and yet it would have been out of his hands and Lewis would have only gotten the white-washed version. The platitudes of words ringing like death bells, just pleasant sound and dusty magic for the ones left behind.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nHe\u2019d kept his distance. It would have been easier for Robert if it had stayed that way. He\u2019d already buried one bagman. That one, Robbie had at least kissed. \n\n What he\u2019d learned on the Camino was that truth need not get in the way of truth. . \n\nNick Dugger,a fellow traveler, had told him the truth. \u201cDie for something or someone or bloody do it alone. That\u2019s me, mate. Got the cancer, see. Nothin\u2019 like a Kiwi with a death wish and just enough cash for beer and a few stars? Pray for me.\u201d \n\nNick had walked with him and they had been oblivious to the storms and the warnings the mere mortals must heed, laughing at death and demanding it. They found elation and camaraderie out there sailing too close to the wind and living in the moment. It was the purest happiness James had ever felt.\n\n One night in Itero del Castillo at an old church with only twelve beds called Hospital de San Nicolas, Nick bedded down after a simple meal, a great deal of wine and his evening dose of morphine. He never woke up again.\n\nJames opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was Nick looking at him with clouded corneas, just three feet between the beds.\n\n\n(To apply this technique the researchers analyse initially potassium, urea and hypoxantine (a DNA metabolite) concentrations present in the vitreous humour of the eye of the human cadaver, and introduce these figures into a computer programme. \u201cThe equations we have developed now make it possible for us to estimate the PMI more precisely than before, and provide a useful and accessible tool to forensic pathologists that is easy to use\u201d Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Munoz Bar\u00fas, one of the authors of the study, explains to SINC, and who is also a specialist doctor from the Institute of Legal Medicine at the University of Santiago de Compostela)**\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n James bid him a final Buen Camino and traveled on. \n\n Hathaway placed his \u2018Lewis\u2019 Stone at Cruz de Fierro but he\u2019d also placed Nick\u2019s next to it and he\u2019d then cried for two hours. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nhttp://www.science20.com/news_releases/forensics_what_eyes_can_tell_us_about_time_death\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d taken Nick\u2019s words to heart. It was why he\u2019d come back and sat his OSPRE. Who could be a better copper than someone with nothing to lose and nothing to gain?\n\nHe is addicted to it, needs it to keep from screaming and now he is standing in this alley making light of the fact he knows he is wrapped in bells and flowers and there are no consequences to worry about any longer because he accepts his fate. \n\nBut this night in this ally, he knew he\u2019d given the game away to DI Lewis. Those blue eyes were in puzzle solving mode. His face relaxes into a theory. All that\u2019s left is the interrogation. \n\nLewis meets his eyes covering the anger bubbling under his next statement, \u201cI have seen you in your smalls at the pool, lad. If I believed for a second that you were gasping for a taste o\u2019 the likes, I have to bear witness that you undoubtedly have the bollocks to have made mention sometime in the last ten years.\u201d \n\nIt was said as a joke, but the tension made it more a challenge. \n\nJames smirked then said in his most cocky fashion, \u201cThe coward dies a thousand deaths, Sir. However, bravery is debatable in the terms of facing the wrath of Hobson, so I suggest you press send and that we ascend back up to the party before we are the focus of her ire. No bride wants to celebrate her engagement alone. After you, Sir.\u201d He says laying on his inebriation a bit thicker than is truth. \n\nRobbie hands James his phone. \u201cYou\u2019re better at the donkey work than I ever was. Mr. Innocent is in there under Lowlife. Sorry, Ma\u2019am.\u201d \n\nJean laughs and says with appreciation, \u201cI should promote you if you were not a consulting detective. Come on Sherlock and pasty Luther\u2026 Into the breach then?\u201d She steps through the door.\n\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie waits, holding the door for James, face full of thunder. \u201cAt your convenience, soft lad, we need to talk.\u201d \n\nJames looks up at Robbie from sending the photos. He hands his phone back and stands in the doorway briefly. \u201cNo, Robert. We don\u2019t. You think you want answers out of habit. The only tale I have to tell is this\u2026\u201d He bends his face to Lewis and kisses him hard on the lips. Groaning slightly in regret as he pulls away. He whispers right in Robbies ear, \u201cIt\u2019s all true. I am a coward and a fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cHathaway!\u201d Robbie exclaimed.\n\nJames smiled as if he is in pain, \u201cAll the answers in one fell confession. No need to pretend to be so surprised. You always were the brains and you will figure it out.\u201d \n\nJames barely made it upstairs before he offered his regrets and made a quick exit. \n\n Robbie tried to follow him but James threw a dismissive, \u201cYou owe me a pint soon!\u201d over his shoulder and waved him off as he strolled quickly up the street. \n\nRobbie tried not to look shell shocked as he made his way back upstairs.\n\nJames was in the offy deciding between vodka and whisky when his text alert chimed. \n\nIt was Robert. \u2018Coming to yours after the do. See you then.\u201d\n\nWhisky it is. \n\nHe\u2019d made a large dent in the bottle when the knock came three hours later. He rose from the couch and stumbled toward the door. \u201cRobbie. What a pleasant surprise.\u201d he said with a cheeky grin.\n\n\u201cI texted you.\u201d Robbie said with disapproval at the state of him. \u201cSee you used the time wisely.\u201d \n\n\u201cIndeed. Best just get on with it. Join?\u201d Hathaway asked flopping on the couch and pouring a generous, actually near overflowing, glass for Robbie and refilling his own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too pissed to talk. What is wrong with you?\u201d Robbie asked with irritation.\n\nJames giggled. \u201cI was told a while back that nothing was wrong with me. I needed to hear that so much. Guess who said it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames. I\u2019ve no bloody idea. But there is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI went home with her and she held me and promised me that there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me. Then she tried to burn me alive. But the best part is that once in my life, for a few minutes, someone let me believe that. I have no idea why you bothered to save me. You want to talk? Tell me that. Why did you bother? Hmm?\u201d James demanded as if he were actually just curious. \n\nRobbie took a long gulp of the whiskey. \u201cHow much have you had?\u201d \n\n\u201cMmmm. Not enough.\u201d James raised his glass and downed it. \n\n\u201cChrist lad, are you trying to kill yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the rumor. I'd say not officially but smoke fire and all that rot.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Robbie asks in a neutral voice. \n\nJames laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want help and I\u2019m not going to harm myself and I don\u2019t want saved. Got it?\u201d He points at Robbie, his face suddenly quite sober and intense. \n\nRobbie met his eyes holding them and assessing him for the first time in a long time. \u201cWhat happened on this long not-a pilgrimage walk of yours? That\u2019s where all this started. The James I know didn\u2019t come back. What happened out there, lad? Please, I\u2019m just trying to understand. You come back. Never have a moment to spare for me, go back to the very thing you said you had to get away from like a junkie chasing a fix and everything about you is\u2026like you only wear black now and you are so bloody superior. What changed? You left without a word and next I know you\u2019re just\u2026\u201dHe waved his hand at James as further explanation. \u201c\u2026This!\u201d \n\nJames lit a cigarette. The smoke billowed out his nose. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in Spain that I changed. It was here. I walked a thousand miles there and back and I still can\u2019t find \u2026anything. It didn\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t enough penance. So I came back to the only thing I had left. I\u2019m not going to kill myself, I just refuse to put my survival above anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s not the same thing and you can\u2019t even criticize because you taught me and I saw it in you whether you admit it or not.\u201d\n\nRobbie sipped his drink. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t deny you that one. But I lost the only thing that mattered to me at the time and it took me a long time to get settled with that. There was an event that made me that way. What do I not know?\u201d \n\nJames smirked, \u201cGrammar and spelling, mostly.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery funny. Go on with you, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell. There wasn\u2019t one death that did it, but several. People I pushed, people I didn\u2019t push. But one way or another, my actions ended lives. I am trying to make it stop\u2026but it just never does. So I keep on, for now. That\u2019s all.\u201d James shrugged unable to explain more.\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell me this, in all honesty, how much of this is my fault? Have I done something that\u2019s caused this or added to it? I mean, you know what I have heard and\u2026well\u2026it was probably just a big joke but\u2026you kissed me. It didn\u2019t feel like a joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI kissed Jean too. She\u2019s not here grilling me.\u201d James squinted and looked around as if he was suddenly unsure. \u201cShe\u2019s very sneaky. Maybe we should clear the flat, just to make sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust you and me, lad. Promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked kissing you more, sir.\u201d James laughed gleefully at the look of disapproving shock Robbie gave him for a split second.\n\nRobbie couldn\u2019t help but snicker at that, surprised but flattered, but he returned quickly to the subject and his eyes drilled into Hathaway\u2019s. \u201cYou said it was all true. That you were a coward and a fraud. I know you are no coward and I don\u2019t believe you are a fraud. What is true?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Trust me, you don\u2019t want to cast into that lake. And you are not as blind as you pretend to be. Don\u2019t shame me like this, Robbie. I\u2019m too pissed to lie and you will hate me for the truth. I hate me, for it.\u201d James said in a low dangerous voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking aren\u2019t I?\u201d Robbie demands. \u201cI\u2019m here and I am asking. Why can\u2019t you trust me to accept what you have to say? Do you think so bloody little of me that I get no chance to even try to put it to right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may think you want to know. But you don\u2019t because if you did, you already would!\u201d James sloshed his drink down his front and tried to brush the liquid back into the glass then rubbed the rest into his shirt. \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going anywhere so talk or don\u2019t. Up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is up to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFixing this is? It\u2019s all up to you. You have all the cards and I am lost for what\u2019s to be done!\u201d Robbie said a bit too loud out of frustration. \n\n\u201cThere is nothing to be done. It is over. You have made your decision. Not like you can go back and say do over and not like there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d want to. I accept it. I always knew I would end up here. It\u2019s fine. Have a lovely life and do send me a post card from happy and perfect. It\u2019s not your fault. It is mine. Only mine. The kiss? Well, it was goodbye. It was nothing left to lose and taking what I want for just a moment. It was one less regret if I die tomorrow or next month or ten years from now \u2013 God, I need a drink because that is a depressing thought \u2013 please God, I beg you, do not make me wait that long, Amen.\u201d He shook his head and tried to gain control.\n\nHe looked over at Robbie and his face filled with a stoic sorrow, \u201cLook, I know you will be uncomfortable and weird tomorrow anyway and I expect that we won\u2019t have any more of these lads-down-the-pub moments so there it is. I\u2019m so very sorry. Just know that when you walk out that door tonight \u2013 I will never so much as ask you for a paper clip if I can find a way to avoid it and I don\u2019t expect you to hold that best man slot open because if there is any merciful God out there he could not be so cruel as to make me live long enough to see the happy event in the first place. There. Now you can just go and be shed of me once and for all. Best wishes and thanks for all you have done for me before I lost my mind\u2026Sir.\u201d James collapses back against the couch and turns his head and shuts his eyes waiting for Robbie to storm out. He doesn\u2019t want to see his face and he doesn\u2019t want the image of him leaving to be stuck on a loop in his brain every night for the rest of his life. \n\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie takes another swallow of his drink. \u201cEvery time I think I know you, I find out you lied.\u201d\n\n \u201cI didn\u2019t lie. I just let you know without expectation of how you would interpret my feelings. Love should not demand or be given in exchange for the price of it being returned equally. That isn\u2019t a lie. It is simply unconditional.\u201d \n\n\u201cPut it like that, sounds pretty great for the one who gets loved and pretty dark for the one who isn\u2019t. But you are wrong, because love is a two way street or it can\u2019t last. Gives one person too much power.\u201d Robbie says as gently as he can.\n\n\u201cIt was my choice. That\u2019s the way unconditional love works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are always conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are. I would die for you and I know you would die for me, but if I tried to murder you, that is not the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is, because I would just let you,\u201d his eyes blink drowsily as he nearly whispers the last part. \n\n\u201cNo, you would not. You could beat me in a fight and I damned sure wouldn\u2019t just let you kill me,\u201d Robbie dismissed.\n\nJames rose and went to the kitchen. He returned with a knife and tossed it in Robbie\u2019s lap. \u201cYou think I am bluffing. Call it. I won\u2019t fight no matter what you do. Put up or shut up. You really don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nRobbie chewed his lip in anger, he picked up the knife and looked over at Hathaway, who laced his fingers together and put them behind his head and passively waited. He gave a small nod as if waiting for a joke to be finished. \u201cAnything. I\u2019ve no defense against you. I\u2019m already ruined.\u201d\n\nIt was not very funny to Robbie and his face colored with a building anger. If Hathaway was really this far gone, he needed to know. \n\n Robbie suddenly sprung and held the knife to James throat, \u201cYou think you know me, lad? I could do it. What if I\u2019m not as nice a guy as you imagine? They all think you\u2019re cracked and I\u2019d get away with it. What if I just slowly cut your throat? You going to just sit there and bleed out like a good lad, while I watch?\u201d\n\nJames eyes widen and he sucks in a breath, which he holds, but he doesn\u2019t move until Robbie asks if he\u2019s just going to sit there. He tilts his head back farther and swallows as he answers simply, \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nRobbie grips the knife tight and holds it against the skin of that pale white throat until a trickle of blood runs down and soaks into his shirt. Now something changes in Robbie\u2019s face. \u201cYou let her. Zoe. You let that nutter try to kill you?\u201d\n\nIn pure rage Robbie yanks Hathaway\u2019s head back and slides the knife across his throat hard enough it hurts. Hathaway gasps but just looks up at Robbie, eyes shining with love and joy. \u201cThank you. It doesn\u2019t even hurt.\u201d Hathaway closes his eyes and he\u2019s breathing hard but stays still just sitting there waiting to die. Robbie stands up and and covers his mouth trying to hold back a sob of fear and horror. \n\nHathaway opens his eyes and looks down. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to be bleeding.\u201d\n\nRobbie spins and croaks, \u201cI used the back side of the knife. I would never hurt you. But you just sat there. You could just sit there and let me\u2026Oh God James. What am I going to do? Don\u2019t you see? You need help\u2026or ..I don\u2019t know. I\u2026I don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI deserve this. I ruined Will\u2019s life. I laughed at him the first time. He was the bigger person, moved on. Then I condemned him for that and Feardorcha by default and three other people by her hand. All because I was blind and cruel. I deserve to suffer for each of them.\u201d \n\n\u201cJames, there were other avenues that Will could have taken. Why kill himself in the first place if he\u2019d come to understand that love was never wrong? Why not put his faith in the person he was so in love with? He hadn\u2019t talked to you in years. Why is it your fault? He had other friends who accepted and loved him. The whole thing was just a manipulative guilt trip. Not to speak ill of the dead, lad, but he sent videos out to get his friends to torture you with blame for his death and humiliate you for something that happened years ago. He gave you no chance and did it out of the blue as far as you knew and that says it all. It really does. None of his friends contacted you and they were your friends once. They had to have known where you are, we have been in the bloody papers and on telly? No. Will made Zoe. He built her, paid for her then discarded her. He blamed everyone but himself. Think about that.\u201d \n\nThere are ten long minutes of silence before Robbie realised James had passed out. \n\nRobbie sits in stunned disbelief. He texts Laura and tells her only that things are far worse than he thought and that they have had it out and James is too cabbaged to leave alone. \n\n", "5": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie Lewis is afraid to leave James for two reasons. The first reason being that he is afraid that if James wakes up to an empty room with a massive hang over then remembers half of what he\u2019s said that it may be the last straw and he really would do something stupid. Robbie extracted truths from him when he should have not taken advantage. James will see it as a betrayal no matter what, but if he is alone, the result may be something he can\u2019t fix later.\n\nRobbie also is terrified that if he leaves, James may be right. He won\u2019t want to deal with it all and will never find a way to look him in the eye again. If he stays then they will have to work it out. \n\nJames wakes to the smell of coffee and the surety that hell would feel like mercy at the moment. He is nearly brought to tears as he moves his head slightly. There is a blanket covering him and he cannot open his eyes without ramping up a full scale rebellion of his guts. \u201cWhoever is here, please proceed with the murdering and search my cabinets for cash after.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Morning to you too, sunshine. Here, get this in you then we can have a bit more of a chat,\u201d a distinct Geordie voice said from a direction his head no longer turned.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it took me some time to figure out what I want to say and I wasn\u2019t wasting me breath on someone who was on the edge of alcohol poisoning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh \u2013 not demeaning enough if I forget,\u201d James said wincing as he tried to sit up. \n\nJames accepted the paracetamol and the coffee and took a tentative sip. \n\nRobbie sat in the middle of the couch and looked over at James. \u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d \n\n\u201cEnough I wish I were dead on every level of my being.\u201d James mumbled. \u201cEnough to know you won\u2019t hang around long. Once you are done with your lecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill think you know it all, do you? Must be a burden, that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas its moments,\u201d James says softly.\n\n\u201cYou should have told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich part?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, man. You know which part. When did it happen? I had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that. Slowly, bit more each day. By the end of the first case I was well into the offing. I did try to rein it in, mostly. I\u2019m sorry, if that helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo every day has been a lie.\u201d Robbie asked but it was more a statement of fact.\n\n\"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away,\nJob 16:6\u201d James drank his coffee. \n\nJames feels his throat and a look of cool hateful despair crosses his expression. \u201cYou thought you could scare me? Was that it?\u201d\n\nRobert nods.\n\n\u201c I was not bluffing. Too bad that you were\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. It was unkind of me to say that, to put you in such a position in the first place. Please go. I think we both proved our point. I\u2019m going to bed. I have to work soon and I can\u2019t think of anything else that you could possibly want to say to me. Go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t. You can\u2019t prove this happened but if you need to ruin the last thing I have that gives me a shred of dignity, then go have me sectioned or whatever is twisting around in that head of yours, otherwise, I\u2019m going to sleep for a while and shower and go in to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off today.\u201d Robbie stated, confused.\n\n\u201cYes, so I am. Another thing you never noticed. I haven\u2019t taken a full day off since Spain. And just to clarify, she drugged me without my knowledge. I didn\u2019t just let her, Robert. I wasn\u2019t hopelessly in love with her but I thought I had lost you. I just picked the wrong person to trust. It wasn\u2019t the same as this. I couldn\u2019t move then but I knew what she was telling me. I didn\u2019t expect to be saved. I wish I could have saved her. She wasn\u2019t a murderer until he died and it broke her. It broke her and it was my fault and burning was no more than I deserve. It broke her. That\u2019s all. Can happen to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can,\u201d Robbie agreed carefully.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, it\u2019s better this way. We\u2019ll just call it a clean break.\u201d James offered with finality in his voice. \n\nJames turned and left the room, quietly closing the door. Robbie sat down and stared at the walls for a while then kicked his feet up on the sofa and closed his eyes trying to think. \n\nA few hours later, the shower woke Lewis. James emerged from the bedroom in his work clothes and was in the process of tying his tie when he realized Robbie was sitting on his sofa. \n\n\u201cChrist, Robert. Why are you still here?\u201d\n\nRobbie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not done?\u201d\n\nJames sighed and popped the left-over coffee in the microwave then changed his mind, poured it out and started a new pot. \u201cGo on. Say whatever you must, and then kindly leave me alone? I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t hold it all in for extended periods of time any more, you see? When I am around you\u2026it is becoming impossible.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs it really as bad as all that?\u201d\n\nJames turned and shook his head, \u201cCan you not see? You think I need psychiatric intervention and yet you can\u2019t see? I am not this bad when you are not here. I get by.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to leave Laura? Is that it? Take up with you instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. No, she makes you happy. That is all I want for you. I do mean that,\u201d James explained patiently, back turned to Robbie watching the pot spew its black elixir. \n\n\u201cYou handed me a Yorkie bar? Why did you lie about that? Why tell me at all if it wasn\u2019t the truth?\u201d Robbie asked.\n\n\u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t lose you entirely,\u201d he said in a tired put upon voice. \u201cI knew the note on my back meant I was next. I had planned to spend the night at yours, but you sent me away. I thought if I was alone that night, Feardorcha would find me. I thought you knew it as well and left me to it. I was too pissed to notice you had me followed. I liked her. She\u2019d been rejected too. You saw what I could not and yet you couldn\u2019t see me. It was just easier for you to believe I was somewhat straight. I let you assume. You\u2019d just caught me in bed with a beautiful woman. I may have been on fire at the time, but she was lovely if hopelessly damaged. What could I say?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n Robbie looked down and said softly, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to make assumptions about you but you lie to me when I ask. The thing is, you never asked me. Why do you suppose that is?\u201d\n\nJames turns around, brows furrowed, and freezes, coffee pot hovering above his cup. \u201cYou were married. You only have dated women? What is the mystery to that?\u201d\n\nRobbie sighs. He taps his fingers on the counter. \u201cRumors are a funny thing. You can out live them even if they are true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d James whispers.\n\nRobbie just smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re a detective. Detect, canny lad. I\u2019ve never been perfect.\u201d\n\nJames sets the pot between them. They sit, sipping coffee and observing each other. Robbie finishes his and stands, \u201cWell, that\u2019s me off then. Ring me up when you figure it out. Eat something. You are too damned skinny, Yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. You can\u2019t leave now. I don\u2019t understand?\u201d James says desperate and unsure.\n\n\u201cAhh, well. I can do as I please, you see? The thing is, no matter what you think you feel for me, you don\u2019t. Not really. Not if you can\u2019t even talk to me. I might tell you I don\u2019t want to talk about it, but I have never lied to you. The other thing is, maybe you should have asked a few questions too and maybe you should have trusted me with the truth rather than just your pretty neck?\u201d Robbie got his coat and shrugged it on.\n\n\u201cJust one more thing. You said Will\u2019s death, broke Zoe. What do you imagine, in that great brain of yours, that your death would do to me? Said it yourself, it can happen to anyone.\u201d Robbie shrugged and smiled in a sad sort of way and then just walked out and closed the door softly with a gentle click. \n\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\n\nJean Innocent looked up with a sigh of disapproval. \u201cI will take your warrant card if you keep disobeying me. Three days off, I told you. How did you interpret that very clear order to mean approximately eighteen hours? The pool is either dangerously chlorinated or you have no business whatsoever in my nick. Have you slept since I last saw you?\u201d \n\nHathaway closed the door to her office. \u201cTwice. Contacts in too long is all. I need some unofficial intervention. I can\u2019t work with Inspector Lewis any longer, but I can\u2019t disgrace him by making a formal plea.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, James. What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cA row. My fault. I told him\u2026 I made a drunken disgrace of myself and there is no fixing it. I will make no fuss if there is necessity, just asking you \u2026don\u2019t throw him my way out of tradition.\u201d James said with obvious regret.\n\n\u201cDid something happen I should be aware of? Physically I mean?\u201d she asked as if her face hurt.\n\n\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. I didn\u2019t make a pass at him. But I said far, far too much and\u2026it was not pretty.\u201d James hung his head in shame. \u201cI think it was a bit of a punt at best, but now, it just can\u2019t be. I lost fair and square. If it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry. Truly. I will do my best.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks. How is Mr. Innocent this morning?\u201d he asked with a cheeky grin.\n\n\u201cFuming and refusing to speak to me. Though in my case, I consider it a blessing. Tell me this, would a transfer help you? They always need experience at the MET.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible. Let\u2019s just leave it here for right now. I think avoidance should suffice. Neither of us would want more fuss about it,\u201d James said while standing. He nodded to her and returned to his office. \n\nAn hour later, she knocked on his door. \u201cDomestic. One death. Messy. Davies is on, but you are here against my orders and he has sick little ones. You want it?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and jumped up, \u201cOf course. On my way.\u201d \n\n\u201cMaddox is out of town. I don\u2019t have anyone to send with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d he said snagging the details out of her hand as he shrugged into his coat. \n\n\u201cUniform is on scene. They say it looks open and shut.\u201d She adds to his back.\n\n", "7": "\nChapter Text\n\nOpen and shut is not what it is. The husband is hysterical, one officer is wounded having taken a crack to the head while trying to subdue the ax wielding husband and there is a woman\u2019s head in the back garden but most of the rest of her is in the bathtub. Her hands are currently unaccounted for. \n\nThey have the man cornered but are waiting for back up to deal with him. James rolls his eyes and enters the bedroom with little bother. He shoves his hands in his pockets and looks at the man. \u201cMr. Hadley, I know you didn\u2019t do this. I am going to find out who did and put him away for a very long time. My deepest most heartfelt condolences. May I have the ax, please?\u201d\n\nHadley stared at him, blinking in fear and shock.\n\nJames moves close to him and squats down in his line of sight, voice gentle, eyes full of sympathy and kindness. He said as if to a friend, \u201cYou are scaring my constables. Not the most brilliant lot, but they all dress alike. Give me the ax, you are safe now.\u201d\n\nThe man hands James the ax and quietly follows him to the car. James insists they find Mr. Hadley some tea and they sit down for a perfectly civilized interview considering the man is in shock. The ax is clean except for smudges on the handle. \n\nThe husband says he came home and found her like this and that the monster in the flat next door did it. He chased him away with the ax. \n\n The neighbours say the Hadley\u2019s were always squabbling and the flat the husband identified as the home of the murdering monster has been empty for ages. \n\nThe thing is, the husband has almost no blood on him so James is pretty sure that he could not have done it. \n\n James goes to the flat next door and knocks again, despite uniform attempting during their neighbourhood canvas. There is no answer so he goes around to the back and with a little shove, the door gives way. He almost immediately sees blood and bends down to confirm it is fresh. He uses his radio to inform the others of the situation. \n\nThe hair stands up on his neck when two small birds are suddenly startled\u00a0and he whirls around just in time to feel a searing heat in his chest and smell the putrid breath of the most enormous feral human he\u2019s ever laid eyes on. \u201cPolice,\u201d He wheezes as the knife plunges into him again. \n\nHe fights as best he can, but he\u2019s in so much pain it is a losing battle. \n\n Three more wounds and a kick in the gut after he was down, made him lose control of both his bladder and his bowel. He\u2019d seen it over and over. It is simply part of the dying process. He is still embarrassed. He dropped the radio during the scuffle and can\u2019t call for help. He attempted to move enough to reach it. He can hear them calling for him to respond. The pain is without measure and he vomits the coffee as every muscle in his body begins to shutter.\u00a0\n\n From the open doorway, a lively black and white bird walks toward him cautiously watching his blood run with its curious beady eyes.\u00a0 Suddenly it is joined by its mate. She's the brave one and darts forwards to steal one of his pale blue buttons that flew off his shirt. The male takes his time walking toward a silver\u00a0sweet wrapper. He steps in some of the blood and leaves little vivid red footprints.\u00a0\u00a0They leave with their prizes.\u00a0\n\nJames watched the blood inch away\u00a0silently while he tried to make his lungs work,\u00a0 Tiny sips of air\u00a0were the best he could manage and he\u00a0was so very tired. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOh God, Robbie, forgive me.\u201d he whispered to nobody and mumbled the beginning of the rosary in Latin, \u201cIn Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Credo in Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus unicum\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t get far. His lips were moving and his eyes were still open when two uniform officers found him on his side, curled into a ball and blood draining in a narrow stream ten feet long on the uneven warped floor. They could not understand what he was mumbling but did what first aid they could as the word went out that DI Hathaway was down and it was bad. \n\nHe thought for a moment that a very young Robbie was there and grabbed his sleeve and managed to ask his forgiveness as his vision blurred and narrowed. \n\nHe coded in the ambulance. \n\n", "8": "\nChapter Text\n\nLaura\u2019s phone went off and she\u2019d just noted down the details when a look of horror struck her face and she said, \u201cOh God\u2026Oh no\u2026\u201dwhen Lewis\u2019s phone rang. \n\nHe glanced at Laura with a question but answered his own call. \n\nJean sagged in her chair and blinked away tears. She swallowed and made her voice steady as she spoke on the phone. \u201cLewis, I am sending a car. It\u2019s James. He\u2019s in theater now. They barely got him to hospital?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Robbie asked knowing now that Laura was a step ahead and why she looked close to tears. \n\n\u201cThe open and shut, easy thing turned into a fairytale, which turned out to be real. He was stabbed, more than once. Thank God the ambulance was already on its way.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t send a car. I will drop, Laura off then head over to the hospital. We both know me sitting and twiddling my thumbs won\u2019t do the lad any good. Who is on scene and did they catch him?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, no the attacker, is at large and there is no way I will allow you to go off half-cocked and bully your way onto this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt to let me have a look though. James is not going to live or die because I am here or there. That is up to him and from the sound of it, at least I\u2019d be a little useful if I was helping find the guy who did it before he does it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless, I expect you to keep me apprised of any developments in DI Hathaway\u2019s condition. I am not letting you take this over. Unless, you don\u2019t want to be there? I know you have had a pretty serious row. It\u2019s just, you\u2019re his emergency contact\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. I\u2026umm. Handing you to Hobson\u2026\u201d\n\nRobbie turns to Laura and his chin wobbles as he hands her the phone and shakes in silent grief. \n\nLaura takes the phone and finishes the call. \n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s done it then. Didn\u2019t have a few days. Didn\u2019t have a few hours even. How can he do this to me?\u201d Robbie pleads when he feels her arms around his shoulders. \n\nLaura cocks her head slightly, \u201cTo you? What an odd thought. He\u2019s the one in hospital, working his days off and attacked? He\u2019s doing this to himself, Robbie. Yesterday he was your best friend and three hours ago you come home in a temper and now you seem more cross than concerned. What exactly happened over there?\u201d\n\nRobbie shakes his head, \u201cI wish I bloody knew. But I will say, that what I thought was going on in his head and what I thought I knew about him was mostly lies. Hours ago, he said he was no danger to himself. Promised me. Just another lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobbie. He didn\u2019t stab himself. He was attacked. You heard that part, right?\u201d Laura asked shocked at Robbie\u2019s callous behavior. \n\n\u201cShould\u2019a been with him. He never even rang. Only one explanation,\u201d Robbie snorted air out his nose in frustration. \n\n\u201cYou are not thinking straight, love,\u201d Laura said with a soft kiss and a cup of his cheek. \u201cNow go see to your awkward sod. Be there as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nRobbie's lips thinned in disagreement with her but he didn\u2019t say any more. He wasn\u2019t sure he could explain the dragging despair tugging at his chest, so he just nodded and covered her hand before turning to the window to await his ride.\n\n", "9": "\nChapter Text\n\nThe car pulled up and Lewis slammed the door to the house as he left. Just then Laura\u2019s phone rang again and she scrambled to get herself together and remain detached. As she drove to the scene, chills went down her spine knowing she was heading to what may be logged in as Hathaway\u2019s final case. \n\nLaura had completed her tasks with the dead woman. SOCO had taken over. A sick curiosity led her under the tape next door. \u00a0She looked into the room lit brilliantly with portable light sticks and could see the blood of her friend. There were footprints all around the area, blackish red in the florescent, where people had walked in his life blood to save his life. There were photography flashes coming from another room.\n\n It was odd to think that this had been inside him when she saw him last night and now it was a painting of violence and chaotic footprints. The woman next door had been stabbed six times and her blood had gone down the drain. Laura had heard all the scene talk.\n\nThe husband had been blamed at first. He was wielding an ax at the moment Hathaway had arrived on scene. James was the only one who didn\u2019t think he was guilty. He\u2019d talked the ax out of his hand and led the man out of the house. He\u2019d gone next door to check out the man\u2019s farfetched story. Whatever the husband had seen, it was real. James had just called for evidence to log a blood trail and said there were definite signs of habitation when his radio went dead. They found him within minutes but it was almost too late. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s your friend. Your boyfriend\u2019s bagman, yes?\u201d A constable who looked about twelve asked from behind her. \n\nLaura nodded. \u201cAll that on the floor in three or four minutes flat. Probably not a good outcome. I\u2019m sorry doctor.\u201d she said twisting a tiny stud earring nervously. \n\n\u201cHave you met Hathaway?\u201d Laura asked her.\n\n\u201cYeah. Everyone\u2019s bloody terrified of him. Oh, sorry. Weird seeing him like that. He was mumbling something\u2026Latin maybe. He never screamed, even when I had to move him to apply pressure. He was stoic and silent except for the chanting thing.. Just before he went, he said, \u2018 Forgive me, Robert.\u2019 I started CPR. Ambulance got here then, he stopped breathing. I couldn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t know what to do. Is Robert his boyfriend do you think?\u201d\n\nLaura faces away from the uniformed child. She can see his blood on her pretty hands and a smudge on her face and Laura can\u2019t bear to look at her. She sniffs and blinks hard then begins to speak with all the fondness she feels for her rumored bit on the side, \u201cWell, the terrifying Detective Hathaway plays guitar and sings like an angel. He can also cook, is the tidiest man I have ever known and he knows all kinds of poetry. Thousands of classic quotes and poems flit around in that handsome head of his. He is shy, not terrifying, almost became a priest, and will go out of his way for anyone and never even expects a thank you. He was praying, and yes, it was probably Latin, that\u2019s how priests do it as far as I understand. All he had left to do was take his final vows, spent eight years preparing and he has never told me anything other than they hated his cooking, He is honest and has a fantastic dry sense of humor and goes out of his way to make me laugh every day, even when he\u2019s having a horrible one. He is a top notch policeman and lets it all get to him much too deeply. He has a first in theology from Cambridge and he was known as Ataway Hathaway when he rowed in The Boat Race with them. Was a bit of a star athlete, back in the day. His flat is filled with books and no, Robert is my fianc\u00e9. You may know him as DI Lewis? James calls him Robert when he doesn\u2019t forget and call him Sir. James was asking his Gov to forgive him for, well, who knows with those two. Just thought you might like to know some of the important things about him, rather than a bit of watercooler wiki-leaks you may have heard so far. You probably saved his life considering how much of him you appear to be smeared with. Maybe he is even your first so you won\u2019t ever forget it and you should be privileged to know a little about him because of it. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sounds kind of nice, when you put it like that.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t spread it around. He\u2019d be cross with me for ruining his reputation. I\u2019m sure he will be fine, thanks to you. The only thing terrifying about him is how foolishly brave and unbelievably loyal he is.\u201d Somehow, talking about him\u00a0made her feel better and as if she could keep\u00a0breathing herself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, ma\u2019am.\u201d The girl gives her a wide smile and has pretty teeth and a sweet face, despite wearing a half-pint of James Hathaway. \n\nLaura headed back to the other scene calling over her shoulder, \u201cKeep an eye out. We still have no hands.\u201d\n\n", "10": "\nChapter Text\n\nShe found Lewis in the lobby of the Radcliffe, staring into space like a worn out zombie. \u201cAny word?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot dead\u2026yet. Bunch of your lot\u2019s gobble-die-gook. But he\u2019s not gone. Taking his sweet time about it.\u201d Lewis stated as if far away. \n\n\u201cA bit fatalistic?\u201d \n\n\u201cHe told me last night. You don\u2019t understand. This is what he prayed for\u2026right in front of me.\u201d Robbie said quietly.\n\n\u201cTo be stabbed?\u201d Laura asked skeptically. \n\nRobbie sighed and looked at her. \u201cI told him lying to me all this time just proved he didn\u2019t love me near as much as he thought. But I lied to him\u2026 because I knew. I didn\u2019t want to know, but I did. He said the thought of living another ten years was depressing. He hoped something got him in the line of duty. The sooner the better according to his own words. Seems his prayers worked. Do you really think he will bother coming back from it? He won\u2019t. This is just a countdown, Laura love.\u201d \n\nLaura sighed and put her arm around him. \u201c You heard any news? They get the bastard who did this yet?\u201d\n\nLaura shook her head. \u201cCleared out. Got a description from the victim\u2019s husband. Sounds a bit like the boogie-man but victim one is still missing her hands and they were not on scene. We think he took them with him. Haven\u2019t turned up yet, anyway. And apparently a man fitting the description of Hagrid can walk the streets of Oxford with an invisibility cloak because he was not spotted by anyone. How does that happen in broad daylight? \u201d \n\n\u201cHave to be big and damned cunning to get the drop on Hathaway. I can\u2019t lose him,\u201d Robbie croaked, face crumpling. \u201cBut even if he pulls through, I already have lost him.\u201d\n\nLaura sighs deeply, \u201cYou were both drinking. Grain of salt, bad timing; don\u2019t take it all too seriously. People say lots of stuff they don\u2019t mean and it all comes out in the wash.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told Innocent he didn\u2019t want to work with me anymore. Wasn\u2019t drunk then. How did it all go so wrong? Ahh, doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d He yawned and sighed.\n\n\u201cHis last words before he finally passed out-\u201c\n\n\u201cDied. He died. Don\u2019t sugar coat what it was,\u201d Robbie interjected.\n\n\u201c\u2026were, \u2018Robert, forgive me.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t sound like someone who meant all that other stuff,\u201c she murmured as she rubbed his back to soothe him. \u201cGot that from the wide-eyed police-infant who found him and gave him first aid. She has been on the job for eleven days and saved his life. I have to think there was a reason and that it will all be fine.\u201d\n\nHe looked over at Laura and patted her hand. \u201cRight. If you say so, love.\u201d He faked a smile at her and added, \u201cHope you\u2019re correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost always am. It\u2019s why you keep me around.\u201d She said with more cheek than she really felt, trying to cheer him up. \n\nThey waited in silence for some time.\n\n She volunteered to get them some tea because she had access to the nurse\u2019s secret stash and Robbie headed to the loo to get rid of some of the dishwater he\u2019d already ingested in the last few hours. \n\nLaura had two steaming mugs of tea for them to enjoy and a huge smile on her face when he finally got out of the loo. She handed Robbie his and he gave her a wry look of curiosity. \n\nLaura\u2019s eyes twinkled and she said in a low tone, \u201cI pulled a naughty. He\u2019s out and provided it all holds, they had a bit of repair to do on his Hepatic Portal Vein and a few other concerns if infection sets in, but Robbie, he\u2019s got to have a guardian angel because it is nowhere near as bad as it looked. The lung was an easy fix. The doctor will be here in a few minutes to tell us. Look pleased and surprised. After he says all the long words. Not as he walks in the door,\u201d she teased. \n\nRobbie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\nShe rolled her eyes, \u201cI am a doctor, I just don\u2019t have to pay the personal indemnity insurance.  My patients may not smell as nice from time to time, but they rarely sue or hold me to blame for making their insides a bit of a hash up.\u201d \n\nRobbie gave her a genuine grin this time, \u201cSorry I\u2019ve been such a grouchy sod. Thanks for being here. I about drove meself mad.\u201d\n\nLaura\u2019s face softened in fondness, \u201cI know. Now we just have to figure out what we are going to do about that awkward sod of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much to be done. Just make him see reason and hope it is enough.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe need a plan, Robbie, just in case it isn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t stand to lose him either and I think if we did, I\u2019d end up losing you both. You didn\u2019t see what I saw on your face for the last few hours. People do die of broken hearts. My lot, as you are so fond of putting it, have big obscure names for it, but the description, no matter how precise doesn\u2019t completely obscure the cause.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say, Laura?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. I don\u2019t have it all worked out in my head. Besides, your blood pressure is just now dropping from the red zone and I have no intention of sending it full throttle again. We just can\u2019t go on our merry way and leave him to feel so abandoned, not knowing what we do. But, for now, let\u2019s just deal with you staying calm and placid,\u201d She said kindly.\n\nRobbie snorted and wrinkled his forehead at her doubtfully. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked in response.\n\n\u201cYou and your calm and placid. You are around dead people far too much, lass. Far too much.\u201d He said with deadpan certainty. \n\n", "11": "\nChapter Text\n\nJames was walking with Nick. He didn\u2019t know where they were going and he didn\u2019t need to ask because nothing hurt and his heart felt like satin. They often had walked miles in silence so he was surprised when Nick asked, \u201cSo you blew it I guess?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d James replied. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t be away from you long. He won\u2019t take care of himself. He will drive Laura away and next thing you know, you will be guiding him down this road. I have known you were coming almost since I got here. I want you to know, James, you made my last days\u2026bloody fantastic. I was really kind of a bastard and I was so lonely by then. You made a huge difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took your rock to the cross of Saint James for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt you. We all feel everything you do. We know. I have a present for you and then I think you need to consider going back.\u201d Nick said chewing his lip. \n\n\u201cWhat? No. I am staying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are free to do that, mate. After my present.\u201d\n\nSuddenly after what seemed weeks of walking there was an Auberge ahead. James smirked and let out a laugh as he searched his pockets for a cigarette. \u201cBit of a clich\u00e9. Hope the food is good. Damned where are my\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo smoking. No food. No worries, mate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d James said with a sigh.\n\n\u201cPart of you is still on that side. That\u2019s why you have the craving. You decide to stay, it will go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it should be gone. I smell flowers, crushed flowers,\u201d James said sniffing deeply.\n\n\u201cBit of a theme going on, see,\u201d Nick explained with a shrug.\n\nJames walked into the main hall and at the far end stood a coffin. He knew before he looked that it would be him. He smirked and looked at Nick, \u201cNice, Ta, mate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, shitty friends never know what to give you for those special occasions. The old man went all out, you see? Posh police logo on the coffin. It\u2019s going to be a huge affair mate. Fiona has em popping up from London for the procession.\u201d\n\nJames looked down at himself. \u201cBloody pink tie. Robbie Lewis dressed me. I bet I have on lavender socks too.\u201d \n\nNick leans in and holds up a leg. \u201cYou called it in one.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames? \u201c \n\nJames turns and his heart skips and his eyes tear up. \u201cWill? Oh God. Will. Please forgive me.\u201d He steps toward him and Will opens his arms with a grin. James holds him and he is perfectly real. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I was so wrong, forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you forgive me?\u201d another voice says.\n\nFeardorcha smiles at him and he is as James remembers, red hair and open smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself last time we met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to save you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d James said. \n\n\u201cI know. Now it is time to put it down and forgive yourself. You need to go back because you are not done yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back. There is nothing for me there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were called, James. You have work to do. It didn\u2019t turn out like we thought, but it led you to the lessons he wanted for you.\u201d A deep booming voice said.\n\nJames spun again, \u201cFather Anderson? I have let you down.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you?\u201d\n\nJames walks to the priest and falls on his knees and bows his head, \u201cForgive me Father, for I have sinned\u2026I have lost my faith and my hope\u2026\u201d\n\nHe feels warmth and looks up to find his friend shining with light, \u201cNo my son. You have not. Believe in yourself and follow your heart in peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have disgraced your memory.\u201d James weeps and collapses back onto his heels. \n\n\u201cNo. God isn\u2019t complicated, not really. Most of that was just distractions and nonsense and your heart is so very big. We all make mistakes. We all lose faith. I have watched you all this time and I have never lost my faith in you.\u201d \n\n\u201cJames? Are you coming, bonny lad?\u201d\n\nJames stands and turns in horror. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t be here. You aren\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\nLewis stands there as young as James, shoulders straight and a sparkle in his eye. \u201cAye well, maybe I lied a little when I told you that I wouldn\u2019t just sit there and let you kill me. Me heart. Made a right soppy mess of me, that.\u201d He said pointing at the casket. \u201cStill time, but I don\u2019t think you need the whole parade to get the plot line. At least give me a chance, James. If you go, I go, but can you feel that? That pain in your chest? It\u2019s getting bigger? That\u2019s Laura. She waited so long and if you stay here, we both do. I think we can do better by her, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nJames stared at him for a moment and then he found it. \u201cOh. God, that\u2019s horrible.\u201d He turned to Will and Feardorcha,\u201d Is that what you feel when you think of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Attaway\u2026you are much worse. It\u2019s why we agreed to this. Nick here has another fifty people out there, if that\u2019s what it takes to convince you, but I\u2019d think that you could catch on a bit faster. Save all that for when it really is your turn and think of us with love, because we feel that too\u201d Will said with a laugh.\n\n\u201c If you were not loved, James, It would not be so tempting to be here. Those who really sin, find no light here. They bleed out, like you are doing right now over there.\u201d Nick added.\n\n\u201cJames? We are getting critical here, soft lad. Are you coming back with me? I love you so much more than you ever knew. I can\u2019t force you, but I have soft words for you back there if you\u2019ve a mind to hear them. Your call.\u201d Robbie warned kindly arms crossed legs spread casually and not a line on his face. \u201cMe Val and Morse are just around the corner. I have no problem staying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose we could go back for a bit. Need to clean out my fridge and you do need a best man.\u201d James said as if bored.\n\nLewis smiled, \u201cAye, that I do. And ya promised me a pint if memory serves. Who knows, if you are a very good lad, I may let you have another snog before we are done, as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think bribery is a sin, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoway. From Newcastle, me, just how it\u2019s done.\u201d \n\nHe took one step toward Lewis then another. He took hold of the hand Lewis was offering and he was falling. There was pain and he felt so heavy. There was a voice and he couldn\u2019t understand all the words, but he knew the dialect and he smiled. His head turned toward the warmth of that sound and he filled his lungs and moaned in agony.\n\n", "12": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can do this, James. Come back to me. Don\u2019t leave me, canny lad. Just open your eyes. I know it hurts, but\u2026Hey. There you are! You scared the hell out of me. Stay with me. Hi. Can you hear me?\u201d Robbie carried on that way for a while and finally James squeezed his hand. \n\nHe felt the ice chips slide across his tongue and groaned again and tried to take a deep breath. \u201cYou are old again.\u201d\n\nRobbie looked amused and then offended, \u201cYeah? Well, I forgive you for all the grey hairs you put on me head in the last ten years.\u201d\n\nRobbie\u2019s eyes teared up and he wheezed a broken, \u201cThanks for coming back to me. I didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d\n\nJames smiled and carefully said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you bury me in a fucking pink tie.\u201d\n\nRobbie let just the bubble of a sob breach his mask before he regained his humour, despite tears rolling down his cheeks now, \u201cClever clogs. I would\u2019ve done it too.\u201d he said laughing and crying at the same time.\n\n\u201cI know. And the lavender socks\u2026vindictive old fart.\u201d James said and smiled and let his love shine through his eyes. \n\nRobbie lifted James hand to his mouth and closed his eyes and kissed the back of his hand. Then he wiped his cheeks and his damp eyes on his sleeves as if embarrassed. \u201cLook at me, making a fuss.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I did a little, but I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d\n\nRobbie nodded, \u201cNor I, you. It\u2019s all going to be fine. We will find a way, just trust me a little? Don\u2019t worry. We will fix all this somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fought. I didn\u2019t let him\u2026\u201d James assured him.\n\nRobbie swallowed several times and nodded, \u201cI know, James. I can see that ya did.\u201d \n\n\u201cI still died, though. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d James struggled to think clearly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a right pain in me backside and I won\u2019t have any more of your trying to skive off. Damned inconsiderate, if you ask my opinion.\u201d Robbie said with put upon gruff attitude. \n\nJames smiles and responds, \u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it. Sir. Still stuck with me for now. Go home and get some sleep. You have eye luggage. Way past the bag stage,\u201d James said eyes devouring the beloved face before him. \n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be staying for a bit if it\u2019s all the same to you, man. You kept me waiting three days. You can put up with me for a bit longer, like it or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be fine, you know? Better than ever, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Laura will be along in a while to sit with you. I can get a kip then. I couldn\u2019t leave right now if they threw me out, if I have to be honest. Too bloody happy to see you,\u201d Robbie said with a shrug and he reached up and tucked his hand against James' cheek. \u201cGod, but I missed you.\u201d\n\nJames lifted a heavily bandaged arm, and pressed Robbie\u2019s hand into his cheek, with a contented sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s that on your arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust some blood work. Nothing for you to worry about,\u201d Robbie said with a casual dismissive snort. \n\n\u201cIs your heart okay? Please don\u2019t lie,\u201d James said with pure fear.\n\nRobbie sighed and smiled with a sheepish pride. \"Trained you up better than I thought. Just a little scare. Good thing I was here. Laura is being overly cautious. I\u2019m fine. Just some heartburn.\u201d He reassured. \n\n\u201cYou were there with me. You called me back, with bribery,\u201d James said with a silly face trying to leap between serious and impish.\n\nRobbie chuckled, \u201cI have been here a bit. They told me to talk to you. It was a lass there with you at the scene. What, pray tell, did I offer you? That worked, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u2018Mmmm. I think I would rather not talk about it\u2026yet.\u201d He saw Robbie\u2019s disappointment and quickly covered, \u201cThere was a pint or two involved and I can\u2019t have it yet, So\u2026 When I get out of here, I will regale you with my demands.\u201d\n\nRobbie\u2019s face relaxed and he nodded. \u201cHold you to it, mind.\u201d\n\nLaura arrived just then and she teared up and sniffed then very briskly conveyed her total lack of sympathy. \u201cIt is about time. How dare you make us cry over your lazy revival? You made Jean get all sappy and Lizzy actually threatened to quit if Jean reassigned her. What took you so bloody long?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a very long walk. Hope you don\u2019t count this as one of my strikes,\u201d James said with apparent shame.\n\n\u201cYou are lucky I am so fond of you. Just this once I will overlook your tardiness,\u201d Laura said, bending over and kissing him loudly on the forehead, then wiping off her lipstick.\n\n\u201cWhat did the doctors say? You did call them?\u201d\n\nShe was met with guilty silence. \n\n", "13": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter James had been poked and prodded to Laura\u2019s satisfaction, while she made calls and informed people that he had \u2018arisen\u2019, to James\u2019 mortified horror, all was finally quiet. She had sent Robbie home invoking all sorts of terrifying threats that he took in amused stride. She finally sat down next to James and leaned her elbows on his bed.\n\nJames studied Laura and he could see the tiny lines around her eyes were deeper than normal. She always had a light hand with her makeup, but her mascara looked flaky and a bit pitiful, as if she\u2019d slept in it and tried to just apply more. Her hair was a bit of a mess as usual, but there was more curl and more wild to it today. \n\n \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d James asked.\n\nShe gave him a half-smile and her eyes revolved upwards with exasperation. \u201cHonestly? It\u2019s been a bit of a ride. For about two hours there, I had a pretty rough patch. You both were pretty damned determined to out-frighten me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me?\u201d James said with all the command he could muster.\n\nShe sighed and blinked several times, trying to decide what to say. \u201cHe will be fine. It was mild and he was here so there was no real damage, but he needs to be more careful. He got terribly worked up over the fact they couldn\u2019t wake you. You seemed to be doing so well and then it was touch and go for a bit. Back into surgery because they had missed a bleeder, but it was\u2026He loves you very much, you know. He\u2019s Bollocks at letting people know, but, it doesn\u2019t stop him from feeling more than he will ever say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have never told him. All the things I said. It was stupid and selfish. Forgive me for my kamikaze desperation? \u201d \n\n\u201cHe knew.\u201d She shrugged, \u201cHe knew and he just couldn\u2019t face it or believe it or something. He is out of his mind trying to figure out how to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s up to me to do the right thing. You make him happy and I make him\u2026mostly angry. I will transfer to NSY\u201d James offered sincerely.\n\n\u201cVery kind. The problem is, that the worry of you wandering the gritty bits of London, would probably kill him, not to mention I can\u2019t deal with him when you and he are on the outs. I have even considered returning his ring. Don\u2019t tell him that. Things need to settle down first,\u201d Laura confessed. \n\n\u201cNo. No, please don\u2019t leave him. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. He is insane when it comes to you, Laura. The Lawrie case proved that. Please,\u201d James begged.\n\nShe smiled bitterly, \u201cNot quite what I want either, you know. But you leaving, especially in a permanent capacity, will kill him. \u00a0He and I are more, quiet and comfortable. He can survive,\u201d she said carefully. \n\n\u201cYeah. Maybe. But he picked you. That\u2019s what is most important, \u201cJames argued. \n\nShe considered him for a moment and chewed her bottom lip. \u201cI guess we are going to have to figure out some options that we can all live with.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t cut him in half either. I know the right thing to do and that is to step aside and pretend. It\u2019s for the best.\u201d\n\nShe studied his face and said pointedly, \u201cYou make it sound easy. If it is easy, you\u2019re as cold as people think and if it isn\u2019t, you\u2019d just be lying to him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad. Longfellow,\u201d James quoted. \n\n\u201cIf you are miserable, he will be miserable and therefore, I too shall be miserable. I don\u2019t do the misery guts with your flair, James. In fact, I don\u2019t do it at all. Not going to take it up as my mid-life crisis hobby,\u201d Laura countered.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to be done about it. Even if the two of you were not involved, it isn\u2019t as if he would choose me. To be blunt, he has never been with a man and so if it isn\u2019t you it will be someone else. I\u2019d rather it be you. Romance is obviously out of the question, so I have to hope that the friendship is not damaged beyond mending. I would go to the end of the earth to preserve it before I will stay and destroy it. A rumor that I may be gay is a far thing from people dealing with the fact of it, especially now that he knows that\u2026I want more than he can \u2026he says it will be fine\u2026The problem is that people always do. They pretend for a while but\u2026deep down they just\u2026\u201d \n\nLaura\u2019s brow furrowed as she stood and began to pace. \u201cOh God, how could you not know?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d\n\nLaura was quiet for a long time and started to speak several times. She finally ended up staring out the window as she asked him, \u201cDid he tell you he\u2019d never been attracted to a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in so many words. I only know what I have seen.\u201d\n\nLaura tilted her head and glanced at him, crossing her arms and biting at a fingernail. \u201cYou are wrong. There was one that I know of. Well, I say know. More when I asked him, he didn\u2019t confirm it, but he didn\u2019t completely deny it either.\u201d\n\nJames thought for a moment. \u201cA rumor?\u201d\n\nLaura nodded. \u201cIt dogged him for years. You know him, he just ignored it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you can outlive a rumor, even if it is true,\u201d James murmured. \n\n\u201cAnother quote?\u201d Laura asked.\n\n\u201cPerhaps. What was the rumor?\u201d James asked as if distracted.\n\nLaura sighed and looked pensive. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something and let\u2019s call it hypothetical. There was once, long ago and far away, a Detective Chief Inspector and his very loyal, very overworked, very put upon Sergeant. The Sergeant was thought to be a bit of a dog\u2019s body because he put up with the most difficult man anyone had ever been saddled with and never complained. For years they were inseparable until something happened. There was a row. The sergeant was away at his DI course when his boss had his first heart attack. He only told the sergeant that it was an ulcer. The sergeant returned and before he even got his test results, his boss died. At the time, it was too farfetched for anyone to take the rumor about them seriously. One was known as a bit of a ladies man and the other was happily married. When the will was read, one third of the older man\u2019s estate went to the younger man. People wondered.\u201d\n\nJames looked shell shocked. \u201cIf it were true, why would he have not told me?\u201d\n\nLaura smiled and said, \u201cBecause maybe he believed your stunt with the Yorkie bar?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be. That would have meant that he cheated on his wife. He would never\u2026\u201dJames drifted off, trying to imagine his Robbie as an unfaithful spouse.\n\n\u201cYet, it has taken him ten years to get past her loss enough to function. Guilt and grief often are cooked in the same stew. Guilt is much harder to swallow.\u201d Laura volunteered kindly. \n\n\u201cHe loved them both and lost them both within a few years.\u201d James stated. \n\n\u201cHe nearly drank himself to death and then he ran away to paradise and the first person he met upon his return, was you,\u201d Laura added. \n\n", "14": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames didn\u2019t know for sure what to say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. I was never even an option to him.\u201d\n\nLaura sighed and continued, \u201cHere is the reason I have thought about backing out. What if I am the second choice?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nShe nodded but held up her finger, \u201cLet\u2019s look at the events as they occurred and see what they say about motive. You got roped into Kosovo by your churchy friends and he feared you were not coming back. That they would suck you back into the priesthood. He and I started dating officially. \n\n\u201c You took off for Spain, turned in your papers, without a word and he was afraid you were never coming back. We moved in together. There are rumors that you are not very careful these days, James. He\u2019s seen it. There is a fine line between bravery and covert suicide. Sometimes the line doesn\u2019t exist. Your immortal soul depends on that grey area, doesn\u2019t it? You have been flirting with it a long time. \n\n\u201c It was fine so long as he could protect you. But then you came back and suddenly, he couldn\u2019t. Jean Innocent gave him the means to watch over you again and he jumped on it so fast that he didn\u2019t even consider asking me what I thought. For a year he\u2019s watched you run after that grey area and he\u2019s unsure if his contract will be renewed. He has a gift of seeing into people and in his mind, what will happen to you if he can\u2019t watch your back? \n\n\u201cHe has expected the call he got a few days ago for weeks. And he proposed to me. You had your row and then you died and nearly died again. Robbie had a heart attack. Whither thou goest I shall go? Who is he really choosing, do you think, Detective Inspector Hathaway? \u201c\n\nJames blushed. \u201cIt is all circumstantial and easily explained as coincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps. But it is something to consider. I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet but if the coincidences pile up much higher, I think I can make a pretty convincing case. Some believe there is no such thing as coincidence and rather a lot of them happen to be pretty damned good detectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should be telling him of your doubts, not me.\u201d\n\nLaura smiled at him and picked up her coat. \u201cWell, they say confession is good for the soul, and after all, you were the one who was going to be a priest. Well, that\u2019s my shift. You need to sleep and he will be back bright and early I imagine.\u201d \n\nJames watched her walk out the door and closed his eyes to contemplate the twists and turns of this new information.\n\n", "15": "\nChapter Text\n\nBy the next day, James was up and walking. It was a worse hell than the Camino but every time he was ready to give up he could feel Nick walking beside him. He could hear his New Zealander voice in his mind telling him to \u201cRattle your dags, Hathaway.\u201d meaning for him to hurry up. He thought of Nick walking miles, in such pain, only morphine keeping him upright and James struggled through the halls of the Radcliffe. \n\nHis room was so busy he often fell asleep while the ever-changing stream of visitors cracked on. Robbie hovered, playing host and shooing those who stayed too long. \n\nHe was out in a week and back on light duty in less than three, but light duty was more like two hours of socializing and some computer research before being taken to a pub. He wasn\u2019t actually working. \n\nSometimes, in the middle of all the hoopla, Robbie would catch his eye and it was as if he was holding back, waiting for something. \n\nWhat nobody had expected was family members. The day before James had been released from hospital, Jean smiled as she led two people into the room. \u201cJames, I have brought you some visitors.\u201d\n\nA young blond petite woman rushed past an older man and hugged James. James grinned and buried his face in her hair. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s voice answered and he didn\u2019t step forward, but crossed his arms and said, \u201cWe got a call. Booked Nell the next flight across the pond. Picked her up at Heathrow.\u201d\n\nNell nodded. \u201cHe did. Drove the bloody cab right up to the emergency lane and didn\u2019t stop again until we got here.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. There was no need.\u201d He assured them. He looked at Jean questioning her smug smile.\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cI used to be a detective you know? Before I gave it up for cat-herding and playground minding.\u201d\n\nThey all took to the pub when he was released and James smile fooled everyone but Robbie. His relatives only stayed two days, but still, it was all news to Robbie that Hathaway was not some lonely orphan. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was Saturday morning a few weeks later and James had never elaborated on his relatives surprising appearance other than to say he and his father never got\u00a0on very well. His sister had left the UK years ago and they had not kept in contact. \n\n\u201cNice you had a little catch-up then.\u201d Robbie had probed once.\n\nJames shrugged. \u201cThey don\u2019t approve of my work. They expected me to be a priest and they treat me as if I never left. I should tell you that if you pull her file, Nell has a colorful past. I was surprised that Dad got her to come.\u201d\n\n. Davies was still looking for the man who had attacked James but still had no leads and still had not recovered the hands of Mrs. Hadley. James and Robbie had seven other cases on between them. They were not working together but they had begun a new stage of bouncing ideas to each other and Saturday morning meant breakfast and brainstorming.\n\nLaura had given up her Saturday fry up duties and James didn\u2019t ask why. \n\nThis was their fifth week and Robbie was quiet.\n\nJames set down his silverware and looked up for a split second before returning his eyes to his plate. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Robbie replied, popping a bit of bacon in his mouth and wiping his fingertips on his serviette. \n\n\u201cYou have been trying to figure something out for some time. You study me\u2026like you do a suspect. What is it you are trying to put together?\u201d James explained.\n\nRobbie smiled patiently and swallowed then took a drink of his coffee. \u201cRight. Your rough patch seems to have vanished. We never did talk proper, but you don\u2019t seem sad anymore. I don\u2019t want to take a chance of ruining it all.\u201c\n\nHathaway smiled thoughtfully and took a deep breath, meeting Robbie\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan I say something truthful? It may seem a bit fantastical, but it is my truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say anything you want, soft lad. Who am I to judge?\u201d\n\nJames nodded and tilted his head, half smile and amused adoration shining in his eyes. \u201cI wanted to stay dead at first. I knew I had died. Call it a dream or near death experience, it doesn\u2019t matter. It was all real. I was so pleased all this crap was over. I couldn\u2019t hurt anyone ever again. I didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nRobbie looked horrified, but clenched his jaw and nodded, remaining silent as he studied something out the window.\n\n\u201cOn my walk, I met a man from New Zealand. He was beautiful and alive and funny and damaged. We spent the better part of three weeks together, in storms and fog and many a drunken night of whispered confession.\u201d\n\nRobbie looked as if he were in pain and sipped his coffee but looked away. \u201cDid you\u2026\u201dhe almost asked, then faded away. \n\nJames leaned a bit closer and spoke very quietly, \u201cNick had cancer. He could barely deal with the pain by the end of the day.\u201d James said shaking his head and looking up to keep the tears in check. \u201cWe were not lovers. But I loved him. Really, could have fallen for him easily, you know. But, that was not what he needed. One night we over did the drinking. He accidentally overdosed on his morphine. I say accidentally because I don\u2019t think it was on purpose but I didn\u2019t know. He had had a pretty rough day, pain wise. I woke up to his lovely eyes gone cloudy and his body showing the first signs of rigor mortis. The beds in the Auberges are only three feet apart. Sometimes, in the night, he would reach out to hold my hand. He had nightmares and it helped him know where he was, that someone was there. We were holding hands, when he died. When I let go, he remained, arm stretched out as if waiting for me. \u201d\n\n\u201cMust have been horrible. God, I\u2019m sorry, man. I had no idea it was something like that.. I thought it was me you couldn\u2019t talk to. It was that, you couldn\u2019t talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly. Thing is, when I was stabbed. Nick greeted me. He really is waiting for me. A guide, if you will. Death reflected life and he took me to a place on the Camino. It was all different but I knew the building. He showed me that I was dead and then he talked about you. What my actions would cause. There were others there, and they kept telling me to go back and I kept refusing.\u201d\n\nI wanted nothing to do with breathing. Then you showed up. It was you from twenty years ago. You were my age, and you told me that if I stayed, you would stay as well. The thought of myself dead was perfectly acceptable. The thought of you dead horrified me, even knowing that it was so much better than what we were returning to, when you held out your hand, I took it and vaulted back here to pain and problems but most of all to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cQuite a story. Do you believe it?\u201d\n\nJames nodded and said, \u201cI have to believe it. You said something to me, over there, that I want to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did dream me have to say, then?\u201d Robbie asked thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d James murmured.\n\n\u201cRight. Hint?\u201d \n\nJames smiled and shook his head. \u201cIf that turns out to be true, maybe it all was true. If not, none of it matters anyway. The only thing between me and darkness right now is hope. If I am wrong\u2026well\u2026I may never know I am wrong and that is better than a sad truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Dream me must have been a busy guy. Bribery and mystery and wrinkle free,\u201d Robbie said with a bit of sarcastic disgust. \n\n\u201cClever too. Tricked me into holding your hand and when I woke up\u2026you were.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood on him then, but for future reference, stay away from the bastard. Bit of a lad, he was. I don\u2019t trust him,\u201d Robbie said with a sparkle in his eyes.\n\n\u201cSo advised,\u201d James agreed. He grinned to himself knowing Robbie meant he was not allowed to die again any time soon. \n\n\u00a0\n\n", "16": "\nChapter Text\n\nJames was in the pathology lab on a beautiful Friday afternoon listening to Laura tell him how his victim had a long history of vitamin overdose and had damaged his body in the pursuit of health. \n\n\u201cVitamin C contributed to his kidney stones, he must have been in the range of thirty times the dose a day and excessive Vitamin D was contributing to his heart disease and the calcification of his soft tissue leading to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was killing himself with good intentions? So you don\u2019t think he was pushed or poisoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoubtful. He was Jogging. He couldn\u2019t get enough oxygen for such heavy activity due to long term toxic levels of the various supplements he took. He got dizzy and toppled over. Bashed his head on the stone when he fell. Sorry. No defensive wounds, and no drugs in his system, but his stomach was chock full of the 87 various vitamins he took for breakfast along with the delicious wheat grass smoothie he\u2019d chugged before his run.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, shot in the dark but worth checking since he knew the Rayburns,\u201d James stated.\n\n\u201cThe poison baked goods case?\u201d Laura asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Treats left the bakery untainted. Checked the place extensively, owners full cooperation. The family had been going there for years. It was their Saturday morning treat. Employee backgrounds checked and rechecked.\u00a0\u00a0 Receipts in his pocket so we know he purchased them himself, but no evidence of him tampering. He drove straight home but somehow they were deadly by the time he and his family ate them. I\u2019d hoped this might be connected. He only lived a few doors down and they were social.\u201d James sighed in frustration and leaned against the wall with a yawn.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nJames smirked, \u201cGuilty but not by choice these days. Too many cases and never enough people to devote full attention to any of them. The details get lost and it means constantly backtracking and trying to figure out what was missed. My solve rate is tanking and that\u2019s just what I need with the new CS due any day. It\u2019s not just me.\u201d\n\nLaura smiled, \u201cSo I have noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys Okay?\u201d he asked sheepishly.\n\n\u201cWho knows. Kind of? We have been stuck in work related limbo. I see him in here more than home. Part time my stinky big toe.\u201d She complained with a shrug. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been obsessing with worry about you at least. Or maybe he\u2019s just too tired to worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. My band has had some choice opinions about my repeated absences. Jean says this is bollocksing up her plans of coasting into her retirement. She can\u2019t get gone fast enough according to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which. Who is giving her retirement do?\u201d\n\nJames cleared his throat. \u201cMe I guess. Her Ex leaked the pictures of us and now everyone assumes it is my job, me being her\u2026\u201d\n\nLaura laughed and winked. \u201cI did hear something about that. There is apparently a framed picture floating around. Absolute proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be on my desk. My sergeant is definitely not housetrained. Your dear Robbie was her accomplice.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou could put it away?\u201d\n\nJames looked superior and aloof, \u201cNo. It tickles Jean that everyone thinks she\u2019s shagging a lad of indeterminate inferior age span. Kind of makes my day that it has quieted the rumors that Lewis and I are carrying on behind your back or you and me behind his. I seem to have a lot of sex for someone painfully celibate. Gurdip now bows to me. He actually does have a crush on Jean. But, you didn\u2019t hear that from me.\u201d \n\nLaura looked at him and raised her brows. \u201cShame to waste all that peng on fantasy?\u201d\n\nJames looked at her and sucked in his breath. He lowered his voice into a mock flirt and asked, \u201cYou think I\u2019m peng, do you? Have you any fantasies you\u2019d like to share with the class, Doctor Hobson.\u201d\n\nLaura winked. \u201cMaybe. But only under the mask of copious amounts of adult beverages.\u201d\n\nJames tilted his head and boldly called her obvious bluff, \u201cThen it would be my duty to extend an open invitation for the consumption of such an intriguing elixir of truth. Any time.\u201d\n\nLaura grinned and with a challenging note in her voice, \u201cTonight. After work.\u201d\n\nJames looked terrified. \u201cWait. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard me. That only gives you two and a half hours to figure out an excuse to stand me up. You won\u2019t like your favorite pathologist if you stand me up.\u201d \n\nHe rolled his eyes, realizing it was Friday and there were most often pints at the pub on Friday. \u201cOf course. Wouldn\u2019t dream of missing.\u201d\n\nHe returned to the nick and popped into Jean\u2019s office. \u201cPint? Trout? Not many more opportunities for us to make a spectacle.\u201d\n\nJean never looked up but smiled and nodded. Lizzy agreed to come. \u201cJust a quick one, Sir. Tone and I Have reservations. Taking the train to London for the weekend. Still got the packing, and the bloody laundry before I can start that!\u201d\n\nJames nods and invites Gurdip, Davies and Sanders. He is heading to the loo when he runs into a familiar face. \u201cConstable Stewart.\u201d\n\nA pretty face turns his way and grins, \u201cSir. Happy to see you have recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to you.\u201d \n\nShe blushes and shifts her weight, looking at the floor. \u201cPart of the job, Sir.\u201d\n\nHe chews his lip for a second then offers, \u201cPints at the Trout, tonight. You are old enough to drink aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\nShe looks shocked, \u201cYes Sir, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it networking. You will need a DI before you know it. May as well get to know a few of them. How are you at planning parties? I hear you have some caterers in the family. I am planning Jean\u2019s retirement thing, you know. Could use some help if you have the time?\u201d \n\nShe nodded and beamed at him, \u201cCount me in. Sir.\u201d\n\n", "17": "\nChapter Text\n\nThe Trout was busy when he entered, running late as always. Laura appeared at the bar and ordered for the table. \u201cYou are paying for those, by the way. Sneaky sod. Invite a girl for a drink and then half of Thames Valley to tag along.\u201d\n\nHe smiled and handed her his wallet. \u201cTwo birds.\u201d he explained. \u201cWhere is himself?\u201d\n\nShe looked up at him innocently. \u201cManchester. Just put him on the train.\u201d She held his gaze, daring him to jump to conclusions. \n\nJames sucked in his breath and held it. \u201cRight.\u201d He looks at her again. \u201cYeah. Right. That\u2019s\u2026eerrm. He didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nLaura took pity on him and explained, \u201cI wanted to talk to you. Not the whole circus.\u201d \n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d he said on auto-pilot. \n\nIt took both of them to carry the drinks back to the table. James took an available seat by Jean Innocent and she kissed him on the cheek to the delight and whistles of their companions. \n\nThe conversation inevitably turned toward the new guy. Everyone was passing mutilated bits of his reputation and record around for speculation though nobody knew his name and Jean was keeping a tight lip on that tidbit.\n\nJean added, \u201cVery handsome. Very debonair. Very charming and as tough as nails.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe male version of you then, my love?\u201d James asked innocently. She kissed him again and smiled smugly at the others. \n\n James got a few minutes with Beth Stewart and he caught Laura winking at the woman who turned out to be twenty-four and possessed a first in criminology.\n\nThe evening wound down at last. Laura invited him back to hers and he\u2019d turned her down but she insisted. \u201cThe talking thing. Still going to happen and it\u2019s closing time. That is your fault. Cab?\u201d\n\nThey got to the house and she ordered him to sit.  She pulled out whisky and served him without a word. He cleared his throat and sarcastically sipped. \u201cJust the one, thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never continued our conversation,\u201d she said taking the chair nearest him.\n\nHe digested that and blushed. \u201cAnd you thought Robbie going out of town would be the perfect opportunity to\u2026what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee where you were with that? Yes. So, how are things\u2026James?\u201d She asked as if she had snacked on a few canaries. \n\nHe cleared his throat nervously. \u201cThings have smoothed over for the most part. Look, this is\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to voice his concern. He knocked back his drink and stood suddenly. \u201cI should go.\u201d\n\nLaura sighed and poured him another drink. \u201cFine but he talks to me. We talk about you. I would think that might be of some interest to you. I could be wrong.\u201d\n\nJames stopped, took a step back toward the sofa, changed his mind again, and raked his fingers through his hair in frustration. He shook his head as if angry with himself then strode back to the\u00a0sofa in a huff, downed his waiting whisky and floped back down. \u201cTell me what you have to say.\u201d\n\nLaura refilled his glass, generously this time. He glared at her. He knew he should not drink it. \n\n\u201cDo you like sex, James?\u201d she asked directly.\n\nHe felt his face color. \u201cOf course I do. I just don\u2019t approve of a meaningless parade of shags. Thanks. Well now that we have\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were with Fiona. So you like women?\u201d\n\nHe just needed a sip for his dry mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou also like men?\u201d\n\nHe tilts his head at her with belligerence and answered flatly, \u201cYes. Obviously.\u201d\n\nShe lead with a sing-song unfinished sentence, \u201cSo that makes you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cA bloody disaster and therefore celibate. Mostly. Another of my many sodding failures.\u201d he said with anger. He took another sip, just to calm himself. This was a very dangerous conversation and he could not see it ending in any good place.  Still, he had to wonder what she had in mind. \u201cWhat are you doing with this? Some clich\u00e9 seduction or just sadistic curiosity? Don\u2019t get me drunk, Doctor Hobson. You won\u2019t like me very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder sometimes, what you do like. What makes you tick? Why Robbie? Is he your one? Will you die alone because you can\u2019t have him? Is there room for someone else?\u201d\n\nJames shook his head at her in a disheartened display of hurt and incomprehension.  He looked around the room as if her possessions might explain her strange behavior. \u201cThis is cruel, Doctor Hobson. Had not pegged you for utter spitefulness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh James. I am not trying to be. Really I\u2019m not.\u201d She moved over onto the sofa and took his hand, \u201cI am just trying to figure things out. I don\u2019t want to cause you pain. But pretending with only part of the information isn\u2019t getting us anywhere either. I am just asking, and I don\u2019t know any other way to do this. I trusted you with my secrets, you know? I genuinely like you.\" She said, trying to pull him into a hug and finding nothing but stubborn resistance. \n\nShe poured him another drink, and another. She has matched him, yet seems much less affected. \n\nHis head is leaned carefully on her shoulder. They have talked about Robbie and Morse and the weather. She stroked his head and he obediently sipped when she refilled his glass, practically hypnotized by the sensation of her fingers on his scalp.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of woman do you like? What attracts you to someone?\u201d Her hands have begun stroking his arms and his thigh. \n\nJames breath was coming faster and his eyes well up as he realized how she had ramped up a paralyzing physical need he'd never before considered with her. His answer was a sort of plea for her to stop this. He had no doubt where it was going to lead and yet he felt spellbound. \u201cIntelligence perhaps? Realistically, anyone willing to put up with me or perhaps I need a certain cruelty. I was convenient for Fiona until I wasn\u2019t. The last time. The last time a woman got me drunk, I went to her bed that night thinking it meant something. I had known her my whole life and married her when I was something like eight? I thought she would choose love over money and well, maybe\u2026so stupid. I was at her wedding pre-reception the next day and Robbie arrested her. The time before, I turned to someone for comfort, I ended up in her bed too. Then she set me on fire. I don\u2019t have a good track record of trusting people. I don't choose well when it comes to that sort of thing\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry that happened to you.\u201d\n\nJames shrugs, \u201cI should never drink. You\u2019d think I would learn. I never do.\u201d He looked at her and smiled sadly.\n\n\u201cSometimes it lets us connect with people easier. We are more willing to take a chance because we are not so focused on the fa\u00e7ade we show others. You are a very complex man, James Hathaway,\u201d Laura said eyes wide and sparkling with mischief.\n\n\u201cRobbie always saves me, you see? I thought we were joking today. Talking about fantasies. Now this. I am so alone and I can\u2019t deny for a second I haven\u2019t thought about it. You\u2019re lovely of course. But I am too drunk now and I can\u2019t leave and I can\u2019t stay.\u201d James realized he was not making sense.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d She took him in her arms and soothed him. He burrowed into her as if nobody had ever held him. She felt him shuddering and it broke her heart. \n\nShe tilted his head up and said gently, \u201cYou are beautiful and I want you. Just as you are.\u201d She kissed him.\n\nJames kissed back. He knows this is wrong and it just makes it more tempting. He poured all that he could not have with Robbie; all his sorrow, shadowed despair and need into this woman. He understood it would destroy him and he would regret it and yet she is soft and warm and, yes, she smelled of Robbie. It is the tipping factor, that familiar scent he craves all over her. Her skin was\u00a0alight with it and he was already sorry, but his body would not obey when the pleasure was so freely offered.\u00a0 His need whispered lies to his mind and he didn't stop, though part of him was screaming that he must not allow this. \n\nHis head was spinning now. Desire battled destruction and his long suppressed need drove him onwards like a clumsy tank in a sleepy village.  He had had far too much to drink and he let her decide. \u201cGo ahead Laura. Destroy me if you choose to do so.\u201d\n\nLaura smiled and stood up, \u201cThis way. Your wish is my command.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and said goodbye to hope, knowing this would cost him everything. He followed, determined to make it worth it. His brain was defeated and he kissed her neck and unbuttoned her blouse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "18": "\nChapter Text\n\nLaura shuddered through her third orgasm and he was brilliantly consumed in light as he made his blasphemous cries of joy and anguish. He collapsed, unwilling to move knowing he has betrayed Robbie Lewis. He finally managed to roll off her and she snuggled to his chest. His eyes remained open for a long time and silent tears trickled into his ear and onto the pillows. He slept but before dawn he was floating and he wanted her again. He roused her with caresses and looked into her eyes as he bucked into her with lust and imagined feelings that would wink out in the penitent morning light. \n\nShe found him in the back garden, shivering and smoking. \u201dThere you are. Why are you all dressed? I\u2019m not done with you.\u201d \n\nHe can\u2019t look at her yet. \u201cWhat do we tell him?\u201d\n\nShe looked amused and far too cheery. \u201cThe truth is my plan.\u201d\n\nIn James\u2019 mind it just confirmed his worst fears. She has planned this. She would give Robbie a tearful confession and dear kind Robbie would forgive her.\n\n The best part was that he would never forgive James. \n\nHe will hate James for it. It was his job to protect her. Robbie will never think badly of her, but James will have to face his disappointment and utter disgust. He\u2019d seen that look on Robbie when his friend Jack turned out to be a felonious corrupt human being. He knew the look Robbie saved for the most heinous of criminals and now it would be turned upon James. \n\nHe instantly knew that no matter the fact they both cheated on and betrayed Robbie, that ultimately James as supposed gentleman and worse than that, best friend, was morally obligated to let the burden lie on his shoulders. \n\n It didn\u2019t matter that he was drunk, that was in fact shoddier, because he was free to leave and knew the consequences. Robbie would look at him, a selfish immoral reprobate, and he would see those same eyes he\u2019d turned on Simon-the-wife-killer, every moment of his life from that second onward. \n\nNot even a cloister and a vow of silence would ever wipe away the pain and betrayal his actions would fit to Robbie\u2019s face. He would never again glimpse the kindness and acceptance he so craved from the man he loved. That was lost to him forever and that knowledge would make his very existence unbearable. \n\nHer plan was so easy and he was so stupid. He took a long drag of his cigarette and dropped the butt on the ground.\n\nHe turned to her, hands clenched in his pockets to keep from hitting something and blanked his face with his public school smile. \u201cPerfect plan, my dear. You already had him, but congratulations on the deciding win.\u201d\n\nHe turned to storm out the door and she grabbed him to stop him. \u201cJames. I don\u2019t think you\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cLet go of me. Goodbye, Laura. Nicely played.\u201d He shook loose from her and slammed the door hard enough that the window shattered. He heard her calling but he kept walking and refused to look back. \n\nHe knew it. She planned the whole thing to take what little he had of Robbie away. There would be no hope in this world for him again and he had flat out told her to do it. His head was splitting and the cold air felt like it was seeping into his chest. He had come back only to screw it all up again.\n\nBy the time he got to his flat, she\u2019d texted him sixteen times. He shut off his phone without reading them. The day went by as he stared into space, considering his options. He wasn\u2019t fit to return to the church even if he still believed he had a vocation. Every single option was more bleak than he could stomach.\n\n She came round, knocked on his door and sounded the buzzer. She called his named and demanded they talk again.  He refused to answer. Talking had been the bait last night. He had no idea what he had expected her to say then and could think of nothing worth saying now. What would she promise him? To keep it a secret? At best it would mean she owned him until he was no longer of value and then she would wield his life like a sword. He had betrayed Robbie with the action and lying about the action or living a lie of omission didn't protect anyone from further damage. It only added insult to betrayal. Robbie deserved better. \n\nEternal damnation was the price he would pay. Science says that what happened to him, all he had seen upon death, was simply the mind losing oxygen. Nick had said those who were unloved would bleed out over there. If they existed, and all he\u2019d felt was true, they would feel this as well and they would know that they waited for James Hathaway no longer. \n\n Did Laura know he had come back for Robbie? Probably. It still was not her fault. He could have used the brain God had bloody given him and kept himself from making that mistake. He wondered if Robbie would kill him? It was rather unlikely. He would make him live to regret his pathetic lust by never speaking to him or about him, cut off as if he never existed. He thought of facing the people at work when word got around. Well, he needed to go into the office and at least make some sort of order of his files. \n\nHe lay his will, and his life insurance on his kitchen table and picked up his keys and drove to work. \n\nHe sat in the carpark mesmerized by birds gathered round a fallen still figure. They screamed their agony as they nudged their fellow, trying to coax him to get up again. His wing fluttered then he grew still. Each bird took a turn, bowing its little head then raising it to the sky and making an unholy squawk of grief. He read that they were the most intelligent birds on the planet. He wondered which among the charm belonged to the one who died. What would become of his lady wife today? Magpies mate for life. \n\nHe was sad that he would never see Robbie again, but best to remember him as his friend and not when he found out what he\u2019d done. He damned sure wouldn\u2019t mourn James now. He thought of Nick, waiting for him on the Camino. \u201cSorry, mate.\u201d \u00a0\n\nJean was just leaving as he entered the building. She seemed shocked to see him. He pasted on a huge grin and looked sheepish, \u201cJust a couple hours. Forgot to tidy up a few bits and some paperwork. That\u2019s all, I promise. Just a bit of donkey work.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames. Are you alright?\u201d\n\nHe looked confused. \u201cCourse. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cLewis rang me. Said he couldn\u2019t get ahold of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. I went rowing this morning. Took a bit of a splash. Both my phones are fish food I\u2019m afraid. Sorry.\u201d He said with a sheepish shrug. \n\n\u201cHathaway? Again? A Plastic container would save you so much trouble. I have mentioned this on numerous occasions?\u201d\n\nHe smirked and nodded. \u201cBit of a hangover. Forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of my sight. Berk. I will call Robbie and tell him to stop being a mother hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nHe straightened all the files and left notes on all his open cases. When he was done he looked around one last time and left a bag of pork scratchings and his favorite Graf von Faber-Castell he\u2019d bought for himself when he\u2019d made Sergeant on Lizzie\u2019s desk with a note telling her it was a gift and to guard it well when taking notes because it wrote like a dream. He also wrote with a flourish of his best handwriting that he thanked her for putting up with him and wished her a bright future. \n\nWhen he left the building, on impulse, he strolled over to the body of the magpie. Its beak was open and its eye was closed. His friends had finally given up on him and moved on. Very gently, James picked up the bird and moved it off the pavement and carefully placed him in the garden under the roses. One of his wing feathers flapped loosely and threatened to blow away. James picked it up and ran it through his fingers. \n\nFrom the roof of the station a squawk sounded. James turned and saw he was being observed. He took some shiny coins from his pocket and sprinkled them around the dead bird. He turned back to Mrs. Magpie and bowed slightly. \n\nHe wandered around a certain corner and made a purchase that no police officer should ever make. Then he waited for the hour and listened to the bells chime loud and pure that it was four in the afternoon. Four for a boy, he thought and smiled. His eyes closed as the waves of sound lightened his chest with the promise of not heaven, but simple dark peace before the bells sounded again. \n\n", "19": "\nChapter Text\n\nHe returned to his flat and unlocked the door. He was not alone.\n\n\u201cShe told you. And you came all this way. Perfect.\u201d\n\n Robbie Lewis sat at his table, face dark and full of roar. \u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d\n\nJames took a deep breath and blew it out. \u201cNo matter what you think you have to say to me, it won\u2019t make me feel any worse than I already do. I don\u2019t need to hear this. Please\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been on the phone with Laura, she\u2019s been crying for four hours you bullheaded inconsiderate bastard. \u201c Robbie looked at him and there it was, that look of disappointment and misery. It had not gotten to disgust and curses yet, probably had not fully sunk in.\n\nJames smirked and put on his best public school shit-face. \u201cI bet she has. Tears and regrets. Kind of predictable.\u201d He met the blowtorch charring his soul and determined to make it quick work. \n\n\u201cHow can you do that to her?\u201d Robbie shouted. \n\n\u201cPoor Laura. I rather thought it was you whom I betrayed. She participated so she has fewer platforms for my sympathy.\u201d James searched his cabinets for a box and set it on the counter with deliberate solemnity. \n\n\u201cShe doan need your sympathy, lad. A little kindness or at least an ear cleaning so you can hear something besides those useless stupid quotes you have filled your bloody head with, neglecting the care and feeding of your heart entirely,\u201d Robbie said, Geordie dialect thick with anger. \n\nJames swallowed and met his eyes with cool glamor, \u201cDo tell me what you really think, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe tries to comfort you and this is how you repay her?\u201d he demanded then lifted the will from his kitchen table and knocked it and everything else off the surface. \u201cAnd this is how you repay me? I don\u2019t want your stuff. Not one thing.\u201d\n\nJames bent over and picked up the document, crossed Robert Lewis out and sloppily wrote in the word \u2018Oxfam\u2019 and tossed it onto the table. \u201cProblem solved. Is there anything else you would like to address?\u201d \n\nThe wind goes out of Robbie\u2019s sails and he looked at the floor and shook his head. \u201cAlright James. I will leave you to it if that\u2019s what you want so badly. If this is what it looks like I won\u2019t be long to follow. I can\u2019t even get me head around it. I went to see me grandson and now I don\u2019t have anyone when I get back.\u201d He reached in his pocket and tossed Laura\u2019s ring on the table. He met James\u2019 eyes and saw he understood. \n\n\u201cYou knew about that too? So just one last question because this old man is completely lost. Why? Why?\u201d\n\nJames looked at the ring on the table and he finally lost his composure. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. You won\u2019t ever know how sorry. But I swear to you, it wasn\u2019t my idea. I\u2019d rather die than hurt you. Forgive me if you can someday. It is my responsibility but it wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d\n\n", "20": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie looked stunned. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t your idea. It was Mine. Look at what a cock up it\u2019s turned into?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026doesn\u2019t make any sense. Laura wanted me out of your life forever. She plays the contrite confessor and you will forgive her. You will never trust me again no matter what I say and she takes you away from me forever and all my hope is now lost. If that is your idea then I have to ask you, Sir. Why?\u201d \n\nRobbie\u2019s lips moved but no sound came out. He shook his head and then he threw his head back and laughed. \n\nJames eyes widened and his fingers sought the comfort of the syringe in his pocket. The dealer had done him a service. Of course, James knew exactly what he wanted, he had friends over in vise and he had worked enough cases of this rave-prefered substance being lethal. He knew there would be seizures toward the end, but he would never feel them. It would not be an attractive death, but it would be relatively quick.\n\n He reached his hand into the box and feels no further doubt in his course of action. Robbie was still chuckling as he withdrew the syringe from his pocket as if in a daze. He deserves this. It is exactly what he did to Will. Laughed at him. \n\nHe put it down on the table and removed his jacket. \u201cYou need to go now, sir.\u201d\n\nRobbie\u2019s laughter cuts off as he watched James tilt his head back and swallow something in a dark bottle and roll up his sleeve.\u00a0\u00a0 He thumped his arm looking for a vein. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, man? \u201c Robbie picked up the bottle and read the name, Nick Dugger. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough of that but this will boost it. Please leave and let me convulse and vomit up a lung in peace. We all die alone in the end.\u201d James said concentrating with singular attention on the syringe in his hand as if Robbie will just stand here and let this happen. \n\nJames isn\u2019t playing and he is stabbing his arm and working the plunger before Robbie can think. He leaped forward and knocked the needle out of James\u2019 hand. James looked up, glassy eyed and furious. \u201cOh please. Don\u2019t be sanctimonious now Robbie, you just said you\u2019d leave me to it but you just didn\u2019t leave. \u201d\n\nRobbie hauled him to his feet and shook him angrily. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to make you understand. Maybe this will.\u201d He pulled his head down and took James\u2019 lips with all the love he knew how. James returned the kiss, sloppy and desperate. \n\nJames whimpered, a high keening cry and his knees gave out and he slipped down Robbie like a sack of awkward potatoes. Robbie sat down on the lino next to him and took him in his arms. \u201cI need to call for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It will cost me my job. It\u2019s my only refuge, Robbie. I won\u2019t die. There wasn\u2019t enough left. Just stay with me and explain?\u201d\n\nThey dither on that subject for a time. Robbie called Laura who said she\u2019s on her way. They moved to the sofa and Robbie does his best to keep James conscious. \n\n\u201cIt was my idea James. I\u2019m so sorry, soft lad. She and I have cooked up this three person disaster and we just needed to know if you and she felt anything. It couldn\u2019t be about me. If I was gone and you were relaxed\u2026she said she explained part of it and you seemed to get it. I hopped on the train north and all was well and she woke up and you had gone mad. She was terrified. You wouldn\u2019t answer. Wouldn\u2019t let her explain the rest. Innocent swore you had killed your phones and were fine, but I knew and I was already on the train back. Got here and saw what a mess it really was and ..stay awake? I love you. Do you even know that? Laura adores you and we got some stupid bloody idea that we could all watch out for each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, sir. I can\u2019t live with betraying you, like that. I don\u2019t know how.\u201dJames breathes deeply trying not to weep. He can\u2019t fathom how he\u2019s in Robbie\u2019s arms right now. \n\n\u201cI know that now. Look you said to me once that you didn\u2019t want to wake up in twenty years, old and alone with nothing to show but a life spent picking through others misery. I never got past that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was angry. It was a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but that didn\u2019t make it any less true. Don\u2019t you see? I am on the back end of time here and even if I live another ten years and don\u2019t go downhill before. We both know that in twenty years, you will wake up exactly where you said. Alone with nothing to show. Not just you. I had the same problem with Laura. If you or her take up with me, we have to face the reality of it. I may only have a couple years, who knows,\u201d Robbie said gently. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true with anyone. We have wasted so much time,\u201d James added.\n\n\u201cBut if it was all of us\u2026together. Then when I go, I know neither of you will be alone. You would have each other to carry on. So I thought the only obstacle was to find out if you\u2026you know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCould make wild rumpy-pumpy with Laura?\u201d\n\nRobbie blushed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry lad. She usually steers me away from such terrible ideas.\u201d \n\nJames looked at him sleepily, \u201cMust be the morphine because that actually sort of makes sense. But why didn\u2019t you want to\u2026umm\u2026rumpy-pumpy with me?\u201d\n\nRobbie wrinkled his forehead at him and smirks. \u201cI do. There is no bloody doubt there. But if you and I\u2026then I was afraid you would feel like I led you on. And, she\u2019s usually much belter with all this than I am. All I know is that I love you so much more than I\u00a0know how to make you\u00a0understand and even if you had seduced Laura, I would have forgiven you. I always do, don\u2019t I, when you make a cock up of the situation? Conversational Mandarin ring any bells?\u201d\n\nJames was quite. He stared up at Robbie as if he were a child looking at his first new bicycle. James eyes blinked slowly. \u201cI think it worked. I died because this can\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ever, ever do this again, James. Yea know I could never live with it? What if I had not come?\u201d Robbie\u2019s eyes go wide as he thinks of this. \u201cI thought your lot didn\u2019t do this? How could you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all I have. I\u2019d thrown you away and I thought she\u2019d done it to push you away from me. If you hate me, it is damnation and no fire of hell could ever burn worse. But hell isn\u2019t flames. It is the separation from the love of God. A soul will bleed until it reaches darkness, nothing. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nRobbie sat and waited. \u201cSo\u2026any thoughts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, vividly naughty ones as vast as the stars.\u201d James said then broke out in giggles. \u201cOooopsie?\u201d\n\nRobbie looked down and realized James was aroused. It struck Robbie as funny because it gave him a rather instant responding reaction and James was just out of it enough to make a single syllable seem like the smuttiest word in the English language. \u201cSir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "21": "\nChapter Text\n\nThey were still laughing when Laura tumbled through the door in a gust of wind and with shopping bags and terror on her face. She stopped and cocked her head. \n\n\u201cSuicide attempt funny?\u201d Laura demanded, shoving charcoal tablets at James and pulling an IV set up out of her bag. She was livid and her feelings were hurt. \n\n\u201cAny vomiting?\u201d\n\nShe assessed him brusquely, eyeing him with a promise that he would be getting a piece of her mind as well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cYou should be,\u201d she said with clipped syllables. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand. I do care about you. Both of you. So much it\u2026Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up and hold out your arm. Before I kill you myself.\u201d Laura said. \u201cAnd no complaints, I haven\u2019t done this in years.\u201d\n\nJames looked both bemused and chastised. \u201cBossy woman.\u201d he said as he complied. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too high on that morphine to know what he\u2019s saying. You will have to wait, if you want anything sensible out of him,\u201d Robbie said gently.\n\n\u201cIf a shag with me gets this reaction, what chance in hell do the three of us have of any future? I am making a mistake here, and I know it. This won\u2019t end here, you know? People in danger of this once, have many instances of the impulse. Why would he smuggle his friend\u2019s drug from a year ago, if this were not part of who he is?\u201d Laura said as if Loopy James was not in the room. \n\n\u201cNo. I think it might not be the first time it has occurred to him,\u201d Robbie admitted solemnly.\n\nLaura looked up at him with compassion, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s tried it on either.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs first time,\u201d James mumbled. \n\n\u201cGive me a reason that he won\u2019t just be better at it next time?\u201d Laura said shaking her head. \u201cI have no patience for this sort of drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thought you tricked him into betraying me. If you want to know how strong something is, test it until it breaks. The lad can mostly manage us hurting him, but he can\u2019t survive it if he hurts us. He has lots of experience with abandonment. Maybe we can fix that enough. I want to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to a magpie funeral today. A charm of magpies cried his sorrow, \u201cJames confessed.\n\nThey sat and waited. Laura kept James\u2019 vitals under strict watch. \u00a0Robbie explained further. James mumbled every so often but his eyes remained closed, stoned out of his gourd.\n\n\u201cHe thought I would go that far to get rid of him? How can he be so stupid?\u201d Laura asked shaking her head.\n\nRobbie laughed and reminded her that he had dated people who wanted to do a lot worse to get rid of him and he worked in the thick of worse every day too. \u201cWhat does he have to compare to? Murders and broken lives? Nothing but bad experiences.\u201d\n\nJames pipes in, \u201cActually so far, even with the morphine, this is the best relationship I have ever had. Just saying. So far the sex is to die for.\u201d\n\nLaura tried to keep the laughter at the morbid humor in, but it suddenly bubbled up in peals of relief and Robbie joined in. \u201cOnly going to get better, soft lad.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday morning, James was fine. They discussed their intention with a very somber and embarrassed James. It went well, even if it did involve a bit of weeping. James couldn\u2019t believe they wanted him after what he\u2019d just pulled. He repeatedly begged forgiveness and was awestruck by how easily it was found. They had breakfast and James let Robbie kiss him and Laura pulled his head to her shoulder and petted him, soothing his worries. \n\n Now the nerves set in. \n\n\u201cSo, how is this going to work exactly? Are we all going to\u2026at the same time? Or probably in pairs. I have made us a tentative schedule if we do pairs \u2013 of course our work schedule may conflict with this to the point of\u2026oh bloody hell, this is never going to work\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJames. I really need you to calm the hell down and take a breath. Go. Inhale some poison and\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo. I have quit. You don\u2019t like to kiss smokers and so far the first eight hours have gone really \u2026well horrendously \u2026but it should get better in a few da\u2026weeks.\u201d\n\nRobbie smiled his forever patient half smirk at James as he guided him over to a chair and began working his belt off and his trousers open. \u201cI know a special thing that will calm you down. Laura? Get in here. You said you wanted to watch,\u201d Robbie called while flopping pillows down in front of Hathaway\u2019s chair with cool self-assurance as if this were an everyday business. \n\n\u201cGod in heaven,\u201d James wheezed as if he had been stabbed and it was not even a guess. He knew what he sounded like when stabbing and death happened and this was sort of like that except that the\u00a0level of pain had morphed into equally debilitating pleasure. \n\nLaura stalked in with a grin on her face and handed Robbie a tube of pineapple flavored slick. \u00a0James\u2019 eyes rolled back in his head as Robbie fully engulfed him in his mouth and James began to pray, in Latin\u2026of course.\n\nWhen Robbie finally allowed James to complete the mission, James wondered if he would need an exorcism. Robbie looked rather smug when it was over, at Laura\u2019s exclaimed, \u2018Bravo!\u201d\n\n James was so boneless and glassy eyed after, that Laura teased, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have let you go first if I had known you were going to break him.\u201d\n\nRobbie took Laura in his arms and said, \u201cHe can watch you wiggle around the sofa until he reboots.\u201d\n\nRobbie was focused on Laura, who did wiggle about quite a bit when Robbie worked his magic, when she happened to look at James. \u201cBoy Wonder,\u201d she said appreciatively. \n\nJames snickered, \u201cYour Girlfriend isn\u2019t creepy at all. Should I ring up Jean? She\u2019s sad and lonely too?\u201d \n\nLaura laughed and said, \u201cNo. She\u2019s not. Her new guy is retired MI6. They are going to travel. You were just to distract the paparazzi.\u201d\n\n\u201cPity. Oh. We so need to get her back for using poor little me. We need to make a plan. We could tell her I am actually in love with her and watch her squirm as she tries to let me down\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, joy riders. The yacking\u2026Oh. Hello,\u201d Robbie said seeing the state Hathaway was in again from watching the proceedings.\u00a0The older man's\u00a0chin was shiny and his eyes were soft with delight. \n\nAn hour later, the sitting room reeking of sex and sweat, three very comfortably satisfied people were just getting ready to share some ice cream in some mildly illegal ways, when the doorbell buzzed. Three heads came up, looking much like Tarsiers. \n\n", "22": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u201cOh no. Is it Sunday? Already? That\u2019s Stewart about the catering for Jean\u2019s do. I have to let her in.\" James is scrambling for clothing and Robbie and Laura panicked and grabbed\u00a0their kit and headed\u00a0to the bedroom. James did the best he could as the buzzer rang again. \u201cDI Hathaway? It\u2019s Constable Stewart, Sir?\u201d\n\nJames managed to open the door a half-second before he noticed that his shirt is neither tucked in, nor is it on right-side out. He can\u2019t even button the unbuttoned buttons. \u201cSorry I was, sleeping.\u201d\n\nShe looked a little skeptical, \u201cIs this a bad time, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I was expecting you.\u201d\n\nShe smiled nervously and cocked her head in confusion as Robbie came out of the bedroom. Her eyes grew wide and her breath hitched when Laura then followed.\n\nShe looked at the three of them and then a strange look came over her face, \u201cHello, DI Lewis, Doctor Hobson. Were you napping too? Only, you ought to dress him a bit more carefully.\u201d She stooped to the floor and using a pencil, she lifted a used johnny off the floor. Her very green eyes bugged out, she placed the embarrassingly discarded item exactly back where she\u2019d found it. \n\nJames scrubbed his hands through his hair and looked guilty around, searching for a plan. \n\n\u201cWell, having obviously just interrupted something I don\u2019t even want to begin to sort.\u201d she grinned and tried very hard to keep her face straight, \u201cI noticed a delightful coffee establishment just up the road. I suggest that apparently, being the junior officer, that I should pop out and treat us all to some of that. Shall I? Then we can get down to business once the tidy DI and his flat have been thoroughly\u2026disinfected and\u2026aired.\u201d \u00a0\n\nJames bashfully said, \u201dOh I have coffee\u2026\u201d\n\nShe looked at him with contempt and leaned in to whisper loudly, \u201cI am sure you do, but I can\u2019t drink it with any hope of keeping my composure and when I come back from leaving, your shirt will be on properly and neatly buttoned as always and we will never speak of this moment again. Nobody would believe me anyway. Sirs, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nRobbie and Laura burst out laughing the second the door closed behind her. James grumbled. \n\n\u201cHoway, James. It\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Robbie said, his eyes filled with mirth and his hand held on to Laura's shoulder\u00a0in a bid to keep upright whilst his knees went weak with his imitation of her face as Stewart had picked up the condom. Laura was nodding and unable to speak due to the fact her laughter had deteriorated into a wheezing airless rattle\n\nJames shrugged his shirt off and tossed it on the floor then stomped into the bedroom for a fresh one. \u201cSure it\u2019s fine for you. You don\u2019t know her. She saved my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Robbie asked.\n\n\u201cSo I might like her to do it again some time and mouth to mouth is definitely out now that she\u2019s caught me cheating on Jean with you two! She will be disgusted and let me bleed out!\u201d James finally registered how silly what he said was and buttoned his cuffs very stiffly as Laura and Robbie cleared the flat of the debris field. .\n\nHathaway let her back in. She glared at him. \u201cNo wonder Gurdip bows,\u201d Is all she said as she handed him a very strong coffee. She then put on a pleasant face and presented her ideas for the retirement party. They agreed to everything, too embarrassed to even quibble.\n\nMonday at the Nick was somewhat weird. Maddox thanked him for the lovely and expensive pen and then watched him suspiciously. Innocent asked him to come to her office. \n\n\u201cI have had the most interesting conversations with\u00a0two very earnest young ladies, warning me that you are a cheating freak, and I am not quoting exactly, just streamlining. I have also been warned that you may be leaving. Guess which one concerns me the most?\u201d Jean said with a placid smile.\n\n\u201cI would never cheat on you, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you guess wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cLizzy is mistaken. I simply tidied a little.\u201d\n\nJean sucked in a deep breath. \u201cYou and Lewis solve you\u2019re the-other-is-out-of-my-sight for five minutes issue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am. Most satisfactorily.\u201d\n\nShe smiled up at him and nodded. \u201cVery happy for you, James.\u201d\n\nHe beamed at her. \u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am\u201d\n\n\u201cYour phones?\u201d\n\n\u201cInexplicably dried out and working.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad to hear it. How is my party coming along?\u201d\n\nJames never blinked, \u201cNot sure ma\u2019am. Haven\u2019t heard anything since the strippers canceled. Oh, and I am supposed to surreptitiously ask your opinion on florescent penguins in party hats.\u201d\n\nJean tilted her head and waited. James stood quietly at attention. \u201cHe is going to rip your guts out and chew your bollocks off. The new guy? Just warning you, my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot unless his name is headmaster Clement, Ma\u2019am. Everyone since has gotten sloppy seconds\u201d James replied.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, \u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n", "23": "\nChapter Text\n\nThere were no strippers. The venue was elegant; the champagne was cold; the nibbles delicious. Jean smiled at James, her Mr. Innocent for the evening, of course. \u201cThis is unexpectedly lovely, James. How the hell did you pay for it?\u201d \n\n\u201cSold a few clunkers out of the motorpool and there may be a problem with some missing evidence over in vice,\u201d James deadpanned. \n\n\u201cAnd not my problem because I will not be here to see you put on the rack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou miss all the fun, Ma\u2019am,\u201d James said as he offered to dance with her.\n\nThe evening was a success and James made certain to profusely thank Constable Stewart and her lovely family. Jean gave a dignified short speech and then made the introduction of CS Joe Moody. He had spent most of the party, trolling the attendants and that somehow rubbed James the wrong way. Jean hadn\u2019t told him. \n\nAn hour later they were headed back to her place. \u201cSomething is in your craw?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou set people up for a fall. Ma\u2019am. Jokes at a party can be taken the wrong way by someone wanting to prove himself. He will have to knock heads with someone. Everyone was there to enjoy one last night with you, as your friend. You let him\u2026spy on us,\u201d James said neutrally but firmly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way. In my view it was an opportunity to get to know the people and that way he might form some bonds quickly. Rank can be a barrier. \u00a0It is hard for someone to see who he is dealing with, when they are all putting on a show. It was hard for me. You were the first friend I had here. Lewis showed up and I could have killed you both half the time, but you got results. The rest were not so welcoming. It took a very long time to really gain more than professional rapport with anyone. \u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I hope you are right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you James. For all the trouble you caused me, I am still really glad I got so many opportunities to make you squirm. And the party was beyond perfect. I didn\u2019t believe you about the strippers for a second but you did give me a turn on the suggestion of penguin decor. Believe it or not, I have seen worse. I went to one party that had a boob cake. There were Willies on the punch bowl. Mortifying.\u201d She leaned over and kissed his cheek. \n\n\u201cMaybe we all get the retirement party we deserve. You are nothing but class, Ma'am\"\n\"You got me in a world of trouble, but you always made me shine in the end.\u00a0 Thank you.\"\n\"Been an honor, Ma\u2019am, you will always be my first true love,\u201d he said, meaning it. \n\nShe touched his arm, \u201cTake care of Lewis, and Laura\u2026now that you have got them.\u201d\n\nJames blushed and tried not to smile like a goon. \u201cGoodnight, Jean. Safe travels.\u201d\n\nHe drove home. Well, Laura\u2019s flat. Where Robbie and Laura were, was where he was home now. \n\nJames knew Robbie was brooding the second he walked in the door. Robbie looked up at James. He knew what Robbie was thinking and he answered, \u201cI know. I spoke to her about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now. It\u2019s done and I don\u2019t like a person who lies to me from moment one. Introduced himself as DI Moody. Went through training with Jean, from her old Nick. Pack of codswallop,\u201d Robbie ranted.\n\n\u201cNot much we can do about it.\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he told her, I imagine. Wanted to get to know us without the rank getting in the way. I told her it was spying. She said to take care of the two of you, now that I have you. Stewart told her I was cheating. She hates me now. Wouldn\u2019t even dance with me. Pity. She\u2019s brilliant. Maddox won\u2019t be a sergeant long if I have much to say about it.\u201d\n\n", "24": "\nChapter Text\n\nMoody put on a smiling face as he gave his \u2018New Sherriff\u2019 speech. Robbie glowered at him the entire time. He spoke of exciting new changes and updated procedures and streamlining blah, blah, blah and Bob\u2019s your Uncle. \n\n\u201cAnd where are you headed, DI Lewis?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo actual work, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you mean the open cases, I have reassigned them. You are a consultant now, old timer. Can\u2019t have you out chasing hooligans a third your age.\u00a0\u00a0 We need you here for the thinking, and to get up to speed on the procedures and newly implemented worksheets so you can help the youngsters when they bring in the bad guys,\u201d he condescended cheerfully. \n\n\u201cAs you wish, Sir.\u201d Robbie said with all the humility of a bull who was about to stomp a Pamplona fool. \n\n\u201cDoes the former Mr. Innocent have something to add?\u201d he asked, addressing Hathaway, noticing his blatant look of outraged disgust.\n\n\u201cBefore you put him out to pasture, Sir, you might want to check DI Lewis\u2019 stats. Highest close rate in the Nick, still. And he still keeps up with me, running after bad guys, just a tip. You can figure out how to explain to your boss why the murders go unsolved while you have him counting paper clips by eights rather than tens, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I love volunteers. You won\u2019t get your way with me just because you bat your pretty eyelashes at me. I don\u2019t need a date, DI Hathaway. You have been ruling the roost at the hen party, let\u2019s see how you do with the rooster in charge and then we will talk. Think you can step up to the plate or have you been coasting on good graces too long? Time to pull your weight or join your fancy caterers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir. Your guidance is riveting so far.\u201d\n\nThe whole room was silent. Hathaway stood watching the other man slam the door to his office.\n\n\u201cThat went well. \u201c Lewis said with a smirk.\n\n\u201cHe called himself a rooster. I really couldn\u2019t have topped that. Sorry, Robert. This is completely ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart time. I get paid the same for counting paper clips as I do for interrogating murderers.\u201d \n\nJames dialed. A sleepy voice answered. \u201cMa\u2019am. When are you coming back? This taking the piss, pretending to retire has gone far enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cHathaway? Miss me do you? Already? It\u2019s only half nine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaited as long as I could, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it, but what happened,\u201d she asked with amusement.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, he addressed me as the former Mr. Innocent. Took all of Lewis\u2019 cases, called my eyelashes pretty and Lewis an old-timer. Oh, and he refuses to date me so I had better start pulling my weight. Likened your Nick to an inferior hen party. He also informed me that the rooster, meaning him, is now in charge. Funny he said it with a straight face and I assume that if I mention a derivative of the word rooster, that we would have an adequate analysis of his personality. Rhymes with dock.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nShe sighed. \n\n\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am. Just wanted you to know that missing you does not begin to describe the ache of my soul for your delightful presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, James. Well, you do have pretty eyelashes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a pleasant trip, Jean. Look us up when you return. Should try the traffic warden side if I have disappeared from here.\u201d\n\nLizzy sat in the office in stunned silence. \n\n\u201cShould we put our cases in order again, Sir? He left himself wide open and I know you. Cock is going to come out of your mouth by the end of the week. There is a pool going round already. Make it Friday and I will split the pot. Last count was at three hundred quid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seem to have picked up smoking again. Join me for a chat?\u201d\n\nThere were fifteen smokers hiding out in the covered area, some newly minted,\u00a0They clapped when James arrived. Gurdip bowed. James bowed back. \u00a0There was little conversation. Everyone was looking a bit shell-shocked. Lizzy went for coffee and nobody was in a hurry to go back inside. \n\nJames made it through the day; glad of the refuge he had waiting for him when he got home. The one he had taken for granted was no longer as appealing. He might even call in sick tomorrow, just stay in bed with Lewis and Laura. They all had a terrible case of Moody Dick and it was probably contagious.\n\n", "25": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie was late and Moody had already been in James\u2019 office three times to insinuate that old people were of little practical value. He had nosed through James\u2019 cases and offered his unvarnished opinion of the matters until James was seething.\n\nIt was Davies shout of incredulity that brought attention to the filthy giant DI Lewis was parading into the Nick, cuffed and covered in gore. Robbie, flanked by several uniform wearing followers, looked like he\u2019d taken a beating. \n\n\u201cOh My God.\u201d Maddox exclaimed covering her nose at the odor of death wafting towards them. \n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Moody demanded using mumbled curses to convey his disapproval of the foul air assaulting his perfectly appointed in bespoke person. \u201cDI Lewis? What is the meaning of this?\u201d \n\nHathaway interjected at his shoulder, \u201cThe meaning, Sir, is that the \u2018old man\u2019, found a killer and the man who nearly killed me whilst on a crime scene a couple of months ago, and has arrested him, finally. Apparently, putting him to pasture won\u2019t stop him from police work. Excuse me, Sir. Better go see if I can assist DI Lewis with his Zimmer frame.\u201d\n\nRobbie couldn\u2019t help but strut a bit as he met Hathaway\u2019s eyes. Hathaway grinned as he spoke too low for others to overhear, \u201cLook at you? Think he will call me racist if I ask him how that crow tastes compared to cock?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter not give him the option. Not bad for an old man, Aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo explain how that happened between our house and here. I thought you were right behind me? Are you alright? Your head is bleeding. and your eye, and your nose. You look a wreck, in fact. Should get yourself checked out. Perhaps a shower and delousing\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. But I am fine. I stopped to get coffee. Barista was complaining about the smell and I called for backup then went to investigate. He was indisposed\u2026 but the stench. Looked a bit like our Hagrid. When I identified myself, he came at me. He did all this, after I cuffed him. Uniform showed up. Still had Mrs. Hadley\u2019s decomposing hands in his pockets. Her wedding ring was still on her finger. I am betting some of that will be your blood on his sleeve.\u201d\n\nJames murmured, \u201cMy hero. You arrested my murderer.\u201d\n\nRobbie blushed, \u201cGo on with you, soft lad. Course I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Look who is coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning, Sir. Sorry I was late.\u201d\n\nMoody looked at Lewis trying to get his mind in order, \u201cWell, I hope you are up to speed on the forms from yesterday. Looks like you had a bingo today. You are injured?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Us old codgers are a bit tougher than we look.\u201d\n\nMoody nodded, though his face still looked skeptical. \u201cSo it would seem. Good result, if unorthodox. Get yourself to A&E. From now on, leave the heavy lifting to the younger blokes. I will overlook it this time.\u201d\n\nRobbie looked like he\u2019d been slapped, \u201cVery generous of you, sir. I will just dodder over to the house for a change of clothes if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. A&E, that\u2019s an order, Lewis,\u201d Moody reaffirmed.\n\n \u201c Innocent would have had me back out on the next case by now. You are quite the softie, deep down. Sir,\u201d Robbie replied dangerously.\n\nMoody tilted his head back and tried to cover his frustration with this stubborn block of wood. \u201cAs impressed as I am that you somehow pulled this off, it does not change procedure. You are required to be medically cleared before further assignment. Davies will take over from here. It is his case, if I understand correctly. It is my opinion that you involved yourself because of a personal grudge concerning the injury of your former bagman. Understandable, but, not relevant from here forward. Clear?\u201d \n\n\u201cPerfectly, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Now, off with you. Hathaway can drive you. He doesn\u2019t seem too busy. Has time to stand around and chat out in the smoking area. I don\u2019t approve of tobacco use. That little covert facility is not long for this world. Suggest the lot of you invest in some cease-smoking aids relatively quickly.\u201d He smiled and nodded then turned with military precision and walked away.\n\nJames made a face and stuck out his tongue at him. \n\n\u201cI saw that,\u201d Moody said as if bored.\n\n", "26": "\nChapter Text\n\nBy the end of the week, Hathaway, Maddox and secretly Lewis had cleared his open cases. This was achieved by staying as far away from the office as humanly possible whilst stumbling across a few lucky breaks. By the following Monday, Moody was glaring less. Lewis even solved one of his reassigned cases which had the new boss sputtering. He begrudgingly allowed Lewis to help with Davies still unsolved bludgeoning. Lewis and Davies brought in the suspect within twenty four hours. \n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re a bit of a super star, don\u2019t you? DI Lewis?\u201d Moody interrupted Robbie from behind, in front of everyone. \n\nRobbie turned away from the suspect board and stopped writing in the middle of the word \u2018connection.\u2019 to observe Moody for a split second. The four sergeants, seven Constables and two DI\u2019s he was explaining his theory to, turned wide eyes toward Moody, who stood in the doorframe, arms and legs crossed, leaning casually to the left, face glowering mysteriously as if waiting to be photographed for a new detective series press shot.\n\nSome of the other DI\u2019s snickered. \u201cBatman!\u201d Robbie blushed and shushed them before any of them started the \u2018nanananana\u201d song.\n\n\u201cNo Sir. I just do me job. When people allow me to, that is.\u201d Robbie replied neutrally. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I interrupt you holding court?\u201d Moody said with a spark of challenge to his tone.\n\n\u201cSir, it was my understanding that you ordered me to share my old-timer techniques with those still capable of the heavy lifting. Following your orders, not holding court.\u201d Robbie closed the marker and slammed it on the tray.\n\nDC Wells added shyly, \u201cWe just asked him to explain how he got there on the case he and Davies handled last week\u2026Sir?\u201d\n\nMoody lowered his chin and sucked in his breath, meeting every single person\u2019s eye individually so they knew he was aware of their loyalty. \n\n\u201cThe dynamic duo? Batman and Boy Wonder? What do you suppose that means?\u201d\n\nRobbie shrugged, \u201cNothing much. Just all in fun. We all have one. Peterson is Action Man, Hobson is Doctor Strange, Crews is Smurfly, Mackay is McDuff, even you have an alter ego Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I now, and what would that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my place to say, Sir. Has to do with your poultry metaphor though. Use your imagination.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat was Innocent\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer Royal Majesty.\u00a0\u00a0 What else?\u201d\n\nMoody couldn\u2019t help but smirk a bit at that. \u201cThis place is a team. You get me? No superstars around here. Back to work.\u201d\n\nHe spun on his heel and nearly bumped Hathaway. He had not heard James stand at his shoulder for the exchange. \u201cAhh. Not sitting in on the Don\u2019s tutorial, Boy Wonder?\u201d\n\nHathaway\u2019s voice was even, if cold, but his eyes gave away his contempt. \u201cI was privileged to see him in action for many years, Sir. He learned the knowledge from DCI Morse and DS Maddox will learn it from me. Sitting in would be like a London cab driver taking a guided tour of the Victoria embankment.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot news for you, Hathaway. Cabs in London use GPS now.\u201d Moody replied.\n\n\u201cNo Sir, they don\u2019t. Not the real ones, at least.\u201d James assured him.\n\nMoody opened his mouth to disagree.\n\nJames beat him to it by adding, \u201cMy father has driven for thirty years. He knows every mews and building in London and would quit if anyone made him sink so low as to trust technology over experience and instinct. GPS is a fine tool, but it can\u2019t replace him.\u201d\n\nMoody chewed his lip for a second, thinking. \u201cPoint made. Carry on then.\u201d \n\nRobbie rolled his eyes after the man was out the door. \n\nJames whispered, \u201cLiar.\u201d\n\nRobbie smirked and looked confused. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou inferred his nickname was chicken related. Moody Dick is a derivation of an unrelenting vindictive whale.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but you got there from rooster to cock to dick. He\u2019s was a detective, once upon a time. Let him figure it out. It isn\u2019t a lie, just maybe a bit of a red herring.\u201d Robbie said back with a smug smile. \n\n\u00a0\n\n", "27": "\nChapter Text\n\nHathaway updated the new chief on his now vanished case load. The reports sat in a stack on the man\u2019s desk and the meeting had actually gone somewhat cordially. \n\nMoody suddenly leaned back in his chair and chewed on a pencil. \u201cTell me about Lewis?\u201d\n\nJames flinched for a moment. \u201cWhat would you like to know, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou obviously think I have made an error in judgement, delegating him to office work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis record speaks for itself, Sir. I have nothing to add other than he is one of the finest men I have ever had the privilege of knowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. You were his bagman for a long time. Too long, in fact. You left the force and he retired. Don\u2019t tell me you never had a conflict. What is the real story there? Off the record if you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure what you are asking, Sir. I remained his bagman, because I chose to. He repeatedly encouraged me to set my sights on advancement as did Chief Innocent. However, it was my view that I was personally not ready. When he retired, I was unsure if I had what it took to continue without his guidance. There was a suspect, whom I questioned and he committed suicide. I blamed myself. I still do. I should have seen how unstable he was. It made me question my judgement enough that I needed some time to consider my options.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see. Well, that at least makes more sense. Candidly, do you think Lewis is still capable of real police work or is his standing just out of familiarity and reputation?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind, sir. I care about him a great deal. I owe him my life, repeatedly. If I thought for a second he were incapable, much less a danger to himself, I would insist he step-down. He is an asset to the force and we are lucky to have him. You are wasting a valuable talent with making him do constable work. I\u2019m sorry, but you asked for my opinion.\u201d \n\n Moody nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI did. I don\u2019t like you very much, to be honest, but I can\u2019t argue with your clear rate. Why do you still feel he\u2019s of value when you can do fine on your own?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take full credit, Sir. I found his unofficial input invaluable in several instances. Put him somewhere and I think you will see, his results always follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean. When I met him, I thought broken down old plodder who just wants to coast. Then, I busted his balls and the whole Nick closed ranks. So I thought ok, loveable old sod, has-been, here by everyone\u2019s good graces, doesn\u2019t know when to retire. But he did retire, before he had to. Then I look at the package and let me tell you, Jean spared no expense to entice him to return. That stands out. And I have to make a decision about offering him renewal. What do I get for my money? Jean thought he's worth it so there has to be something to it. He keeps smiling at me like he feels sorry for me and doing these unbelievable surprising things and on top of it all, he\u2019s not some smoopy old fool everyone gets along with because he\u2019s a push over. He\u2019s a grouchy old bastard at best but there isn\u2019t a man, excuse me. person, in this Nick who doesn\u2019t take up for him. What am I missing here?\u201d\n\nHathaway tried so hard to keep his mouth shut, but it was not in the cards. \u201cPractically everything. Sir. You are letting your preconceived notions cloud your ability to integrate into this Nick smoothly. You want to prove you are the boss and your bluster and hard-arse routine are just unnecessary and insulting those who would otherwise be looking to you for guidance and authority. We expected transitional bumps, sir, because you are stepping into some hard shoes to fill, but you make your predecessors occasional odd hormonal outbursts seem mild. Don\u2019t get me wrong. There was no human on the planet more intimidating than a calm-spoken Jean Innocent.\n\n\u201c You, sir, are not intimidating in any way, though you think you are. You lied at the party about knowing Innocent and that was your first strike with some people. Lewis even predicted then that you were trolling for a scape goat to prove yourself big man on campus through conflict. He won\u2019t stand-down, its part of his charm, unless you prove him wrong. \n\n\u201cWhat you have shown us, thus far, is that you are the new bully on the school-yard and maybe that was what you needed to be in your last assignment. Not here. You will hear this many times so let me be the first to share the phrase. This is Oxford. You have to out-think them here, sir, because frankly, bullies are the butt of humor and have no standing. The nerds rule this city and they have a special hatred for the sort of people who made them miserable as children. They will eat you alive and it will stop us from our ability to keep the doors open and do our jobs.\n\n\u201cYou can cock-a-doodle-do all you want, but the sun is not under your command and the nerdy chicken-coop, out there, are not buying the show.\u201d Hathaway suddenly shut up and sighed. He knew he\u2019d probably be in a tall hat the next day.\n\n", "28": "\nChapter Text\n\nMoody was silent for about thirty seconds then he chuckled in a dark rich voice. He took one more look at the DI standing before him with his red face and public school manners and lost it entirely. Tears formed at the side of his eyes and he made great effort and several attempts to keep his laughter contained, before it actually worked. \n\n\u201cThat! That is the most honest thing anyone has said to me since the day I got here.\u201d He finally managed. \u201cYou are a smug, over-educated, over-privileged walking clich\u00e9 and yet, your old man drives a cab? You have a degree in Theology but you\u2019re out here in the trenches enforcing the laws of man? The old codger is the popular kid? Retirement parties look like the London bloody opera. It is my understanding that you are sleeping with half of my Nick and that included your former Chief\u2026and don\u2019t even tell me that isn\u2019t true. You were her escort and your body language on the dance floor showed that was not the first dance, shall we say? And, because you have a framed picture on your sodding desk that leaves no doubt as to the possible interpretation.\u201d\n\nHathaway smirked and said with humility, \u201cFifty percent is a greatly exaggerated number, Sir.\u201d \n\n Moody shakes his head in frustration, \u201c Nothing in this place makes a damned bit of sense. Your personal life alone should be bleeding guts and garters of discontent all over the place. But guess what? You are all successfully Swinging With the Finkels here and every time\u2026every bloody time I tell someone something, they glance to you, to see your opinion. All I get is yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir! So due to the fact that you are the first one to offer me a single word of advice, if not kindness, I\u2019m going to let you put your money where your mouth is.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Hathaway asked in confusion.\n\n\u201cShow me what the two of you can do and then I will reassess. It seems that \u2018HRM\u2019 is of similar opinion. Don\u2019t make me regret seeking her advice. Or yours. Lewis is your responsibility. You say he\u2019s still got it; this is your chance to show me that it\u2019s true. Acceptable?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you say, Sir. Thank you.\u201d \n\nMoody stands and lowers his chin, looking at James\u2019 shoes and nervously tapping his pencil rubber on his desk. \u201cHathaway, it has come to my attention that you have recently had a personal bump or two. I don\u2019t know how you and Innocent got away with fraternization in the open without it causing a great deal of back biting and complications in the Nick, but the two of you, despite a vast age difference seemed to manage. I don\u2019t know what you had planned for a future together, but I am sorry for you that it didn\u2019t work out. I can finally see what the two of you had in common. I also wish to apologize for some of my comments about the relationship coming at a less than optimal time and being inappropriate in the first place. Temporary cease fire called?\u201d His eyes glanced up in question.\n\nJames couldn\u2019t breathe for a second. \u201cThat was actually just\u2026\u201dhe began then reconsidered, \u201cShe is an amazing woman, and I am just honored to have known her at all. It was an amicable parting, I assure you. Cease fire accepted, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. She is amazing. The other night at the party, it wasn\u2019t all a lie. I did train with her for a time. MI6. Well she was a trainer and I was a trainee. I washed out. She got married and joined the force. That has to stay in this room, of course. I had heard rumor that you are a bit of a loose cannon? Thought it might have to do with\u2026\u201d he tilted his head as an end to the sentence.\n\n\u201cDI Lewis has reviewed my somewhat hazardous procedural patterns extensively and we have agreed to acceptable changes in my risk management strategy. Sir.\u201d James didn\u2019t mention that the strategy included regular sessions of exquisite rumpy-pumpy making James oddly unwilling to give up a second of bliss because of a foolish injury.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u201cHe chewed your arse out, in other words?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tends to do that on a regular basis. Yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you listen to him? Still?\u201d Moody looked at him in amused surprise.\n\nJames deadpanned with aloof diffidence, \u201cMight I again draw attention to his results?\u201d\n\n \u201cI see. Inform him that he is with you and Maddox for the time being. I expect to be astounded, Hathaway. Carry on.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you, Sir. Afternoon.\u201d James said, making a quick exit.\n\nJames left the office looking traumatized and astonished. He made his way to the smoker\u2019s area and lit up, trying to process all that had just happened. Lewis was the first to arrive looking bullheaded and about to explode.\n\n\u201cWell? Should I be gathering statements for the review board? That looked like a P-45 if I ever saw one.\u201d \n\n\u201cWon\u2019t be necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hell you say? I just got you back and that smarmy, hoo-rah isn\u2019t going to get away with\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t fire me.\u201d Hathaway stated.\n\n\u201cDemotion?\u201d Lewis sighed with pure frustration.\n\n\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s all fine. Good, in fact,\u201d Hathaway said with amusement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying here, bonny lad. Get your gums flapping before me heart goes boom. What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe asked for my opinion. I gave it, in brutal detail. He could have fired me and been more than justified. He laughed. Then he took my advice. The down side is your paperclip holiday has expired and you are once again my minion. The extremely down side is we better solve everything that is thrown our way. We are on double secret probation. And Dean Wormer has a boner for us to fail. Can you and your decrepit heart and your senile old brain manage to dodder around after a few bad guys for a while longer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the piss.\u201d\n\nJames shrugged and grinned genuinely, \u201cI am not. He even apologized for making fun of me right after my lover-superior left me for another. He really felt badly for me. Was concerned my spurned romance had left me fragile.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe parted amicably. Honored to have known her at all. The gentleman\u2019s spiel. Told him you had played a key role in adjusting my risk management challenges. Didn\u2019t tell him precisely how, but he drew his own conclusions based on your sunny disposition.\u201d James smirked and his eyes sparkled with deviltry.\n\n\u201cGood lord, you\u2019re a dab hand at malarkey,\u201d Robbie said with awe.\n\n\u201cGood parenting,\u201d James said keeping his face somewhat straight. \n\n\u201cYou better get back in there and tell them that all is well, or the first case we will have to solve is who started the riot,\u201d Lewis said in relief. \n\n\u201cBe advised. He and our former fearless leader actually did do some training together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. Watch the water cooler and the toilets, Sir. Probably bugged,\u201d James added.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "29": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames headed to his own flat for a quick change of clothes and to check his mail. He was meeting Robbie at the pub in an hour. They would be on Rota as of tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nHe had his phone on speaker as he waited for the connections to the cruise liner that had just left port. It technically wasn\u2019t an official call, but he\u2019d inferred it was vital police business. A Breathless Jean Innocent identified herself solemnly. \n\n\u201cHow is the spy who loved me enjoying her retirement?\u201d\n\n\u201cHathaway? For God\u2019s sake, is someone dead?\u201d\n\nJames grinned, \u201cThere is always someone dead, Ma\u2019am. My job depends on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you find me? Stupid question. Why? And it better not be to tattle that Joe called you a naughty word again,\u201d She said with warning.\n\n\u201cI called to tell you that Robbie got Hagrid. He\u2019s been remanded to Broadmoor until trial because they couldn\u2019t handle him in lock-up. Also to tell you that I appreciate you interfering and that Robbie is back on the stomp with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank goodness. Is that all? This is expensive, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso wanted to mention that though you broke up with me, it won\u2019t affect my performance at work and that temporary Chief Moody may have not fired me today because he has come to the conclusion that you must have broken my heart , which you have, I assure you, but due to his guilt at making fun of my pain, I am being given a chance to prove myself worthy of his kind guidance. If I fail, and find myself homeless, do you still keep the spare key in the grill of your car?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou still have that bloody picture on your desk, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI gaze at it longingly and sigh pensively to great effect several times a day.\u201d\n\nThere was a sigh. \u201cHathaway, I miss you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss you too, Ma\u2019am.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Did you bug the water cooler and the toilets, Ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\nThere was silence then a casual, \u201cOf course I did. Only way to keep up with you lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cFare well, my darling. Ring me when you get home, yes? We\u2019ll go for a pint and pretend we are still shagging.\u201d\n\n\u201cBugger off, you angelic wanker.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will interpret that code phrase as spy talk for undying love, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust email me next time and\u2026Stay out of my house, James.\u201d She instructed before ringing off. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJames walked to the pub and ordered a pint. It was a quiet evening and Robbie had not arrived yet. He stood at the bar waiting for his drink and saw a familiar head sitting alone out in the beer garden. \u201cI need one of whatever he\u2019s having too.\u201d \n\n\u201cDrinking alone is on Robbie\u2019s safety list of things I am not allowed to do. So I bought this round, Sir.\u201d\n\nMoody looked up in surprise and shook his head like a man sentenced to sod\u2019s law for the rest of his natural life. \u201cHathaway. Of course.\u201d\n\nJames set the whisky down beside his boss and straddled the bench. \n\nMoody knocked back what remained in his glass and pulled the offered glass toward him. \u201cTa.\u201d\n\n\u201cTough day, Sir?\u201d James asked pleasantly. \n\n\u201cI work in a bloody zoo. Do you realise\u2026no you like it there. I hate my job.\u201d He looks over at James, \u201cI hate you. The whole lot of you is boiling water for chocolate teapots. I left London for\u2026nerds. Barmy sexually deviant\u2026boffins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will get better, Sir.\u201d James snickered then sipped his beer.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me. You probably want to shag Me\u2026as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are devastatingly handsome, sir,\u201d James agreed gravely.\n\n\u201cShut up. And Don\u2019t\u2026I mean don\u2019t \u2026shag your sergeant. You aren\u2019t are you? God, you probably wouldn\u2019t tell me if you were. How are you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI walked. I just live a little ways away.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. How do you have time? Do you sleep? I mean I have been combing your logs. You worked one-hundred and eight hours five weeks in a row. That is insanity, man. One week you worked one-hundred and thirty. That is less than six hours a day off. You have to shower and brush your teeth, eat...well, you don\u2019t eat obviously, but still.. You were on life support and back at work, what, two-three weeks later? Plus you are keeping what seven or eight lovers on the side and they all get along so you must be making them happy\u2026god knows I can\u2019t keep one. Bloody police work. You really are Boy Wonder. Like one of those sparkly vampires that don\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair. Tennyson. Have to pull my weight, sir.\u201d\n\nMoody snorted a laugh. \u201cI said that. God, I called that one wrong. Hurry up. My round.\"\n\n\u201cAre you driving, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Nooooo. Temporary let.\u201d He pointed up.\n\nMoody returned to the table with the drinks and flopped down. \n\n\u201cDo you come here? It\u2019s a boring little place. Food\u2019s good though. The chips are crisp. I hate potatoes once they go soggy. Have to soak them and double fry them to get them right. I ordered us some. You need food.\u201d Moody said as if Hathaway was just some random friend.\n\nJames\u2019 phone rang. It was Robbie wanting to skive off for the night. He asked him to just come to the house. \u201cWell, I am in fact already here. I have made a new friend. His initials begin with DCS. We are going to eat some chips and\u2026chat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made a new friend? Where is he?\u201d Moody asked sarcastically. \n\n\u201cSo. Tell me all about\u2026something or other?\u201d James asked.\n\nMoody sighed, \u201cTwo ex-wives, three kids, only see much of one of them. Girlfriend wouldn\u2019t leave bloody London and here I am. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cStudied eight years to be a priest. I didn\u2019t go through final ordination. Dove into the trenches and now here I am, ten years later. Oh and I am shagging twelve point three percent of your nick not even close to half.\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cBoffin. Deviant Boffin. Father Deviant Boffin. That\u2019s if I only believe half of what I hear.\u201d Moody said shaking his head. \u201cDo you still talk to Jean?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoke to her tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought she was on a cruise?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is. Told me to stay out of her house. \u201c\n\n\u201cWow, this is the bloody twilight zone. I have entered another dimension. Is there anyone in this city who is normal?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot particularly. Are you normal?\u201d\n\nMoody smiled and raised his eyebrows. \u201cI used to be.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cLong ago and far away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Happened?\u201d James asked lighting a cigarette.\n\n\u201cFood at last.\u201d Moody said in relief. The two of them ate silently. They were just finishing when Robbie and Laura arrived.\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d Laura said as she took a moment to put down her purse and set her wine down. \u201cRobbie had two pints in his hand and another glass of whisky for Moody.\n\nMoody looked up as if he were about to be flogged. He and James both stood. Laura leaned across and kissed James on the cheek.\n\n\u201cDoctor Hobson. A pleasure.\u201d Moody said sincerely, but obviously not including Robbie. \n\nThey took their seats again and everyone stared awkwardly. Laura took it upon herself to start the conversation. \u201cSo, how are you finding, Oxford. You were down in London, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth, it is the twilight zone. My Nick is a shambles and most of my colleagues are fruitcakes,\u201d he pointedly looked at James and tilted his head slightly as he loudly whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s their king.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Poor Jean retired just to get away from these two. Have you told him about James jumping into the lake of sewage with knives? There was an email war for weeks about who would pay for his suit,\u201d Laura said conspiratorially. \n\nMoody listened as Robbie told the tale. He was laughing and feeling no pain as that story was finished. Another round was bought and Moody even relaxed and told some amusing stories of his own cases. They stayed until nearly closing though they got chilly and moved inside. \n\nLaura looked at James and asked with her expression if he was coming home with them. \u201cI called a cab. Can we drop you off?\u201d She asked Moody.\n\nHe assured her he was fine and just had to walk upstairs.\n\n\u201cIt was delightful to get to know you better,\u201d Laura offered politely.\n\n\u201cThank you all, truly. Doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be ball-busting tomorrow, but I haven\u2019t had a more pleasant evening since coming here,\u201d Moody said kindly. He shook both Robbie and James\u2019 hands and they all parted for the evening. \n\nIn the cab home, James looked out the window and commented, \u201cHe\u2019s alone. Like I used to be. Except I never knew the difference and he does.\u201d\n\nRobbie placed his hand on James thigh, \u201cThat was my trouble. I knew the difference too. I\u2019d be hard pressed to go back to that. Guess we could cut him a bit of slack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never lonely. I always had lots of friends. He doesn\u2019t seem to.\u201d Laura added.\n\nThey were all quiet on the ride home. \n\n\u00a0\n\n", "30": "\nChapter Text\n\nIt was six am when all three of their phones began going off. There was a bit of a scramble to get each buzzing contraption to the right owner. They all made haste to find their own quiet corner so that the background noise of the others talking didn\u2019t give them away with blatant certainty.\n\nThere was a body. They were summoned. The morning rush began, coordinating three fast showers, car keys, wallets and enough coffee and toast to make facing the darkness and drizzle outside conceivable. On barely six hours of sleep and the dry mouthed bleariness of near-hangover grinding at will and enthusiasm, the three of them were a gloomy lot with little patience. \n\n\u201cWhich of you clogged my sink with toothpaste and whiskers!\u201d Laura blurted with disgust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been draining like that for weeks, love. I will get to it soon as I can.\u201d Robbie said without his normal warmth.\n\n\u201cRobert, we need to go. You still have to drop me at the flat to pick up my car.\u201d James demanded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old and slow. Which is why you are done, because you got the first shower.\u201d Robbie fired back.\n\n\u201cAnd most of the hot water, I might mention.\u201d Laura said with irritation.\n\n\u201cYour water heater is ridiculously small. I took less than three minutes.\u201d James defended.\n\nThey bickered all the way out the door. \n\nBy the time they reached the scene, they had their game faces on. Greeting each other as if for the first time of the day and secretly smirking at how easy it was to fly under the radar of the world, they got to business. \n\nJames was the last to arrive, being the one supposedly in charge. \u201cWhat have we got?\u201d he asked, addressing Maddox. \n\n\u201cFormer student, turned junky. Found by flatmate. Dead more than twenty-four hours. Flat-mate discovered her at five fourteen, by the nine-nine-nine call. Looks like overdose. No note and flat-mate has alibi. Just accidental more than likely.\u201d\n\nHathaway studied the dead girl pensively. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d Lizzy asked.\n\n\u201cHer track marks. She\u2019s right-handed. If she were able to inject ambidextrously or had a friend doing it, both arms would be of similar condition. Her right arm is smooth. Injection scars on legs, feet and left arm, nothing on right but this needle. Get prints. They will be wrong.\u201d\n\nLaura agreed. \u201cShe has no fresh injection sights. Either a relapse with the help of a friend or\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMurder.\u201d James finished. \n\nRobbie interjected, \u201cI have just spoken with the flat-mate. Iron clad alibi, but something isn\u2019t right. Said she warned her that this would happen. She and the boyfriend were at their engagement party and with family all week. Just returned, but why come back mid-week and in the middle of the night? Family is up by Liverpool. Why not take the extra days and have the weekend too. Tomorrow is a bank holiday. Seems off.\u201d Lewis observed. \n\n\u201cWhat does Laura say?\u201d Hathaway asked.\n\n\u201cDied in last twenty four hours of an unknown substance overdose, probably heroine. Long term user, but not recently. Under-weight, suffering from jaundice and severe gum disease. Other than that? If I thought she\u2019d self-injected I would rule suicide, but she couldn\u2019t have, because her tourniquet is sitting on the kitchen counter and she would not have made it in here, needle still in arm, from there. Someone assisted her, at the very least and if that needle was full, it was obviously lethal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot an accident?\u201d James clarified.\n\n\u201cDepends on concentration, but my guess is no,\u201d Laura said. \u201cSo while you two do the detectivey bits, I have two more shouts with lots of snarky morning people standing around twiddling their thumbs. It was a busy night in Oxford.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho has those?\u201d James asked.\n\n\u201cDavies \u2013 drowning in Cherwell. Martin \u2013 fire in Jericho. God, I hate crispies and floaters.\u201d Laura looked up at Robbie and James and realised what she had said could have been them a long time ago. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cJericho and fire. Glad it\u2019s Martin.\u201d Robbie said with a shudder.\n\nJames looked over at Robbie, \u201cWouldn\u2019t bother me, super- hero, I was a bit too relaxed to care and it mitigated my trauma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still have back problems. Me spine wasn\u2019t meant to take the weight of all that smart-arsery you carry around on your shoulders. I am traumatized. Where\u2019s my money?\u201d Lewis said with faux gruffness. \n\n\u201cI am very poor. I would consider taking out the settlement in some sort of trade.\u201d he added suggestively under his breath.\n\nLewis blushed then shook his head, \u201cLaura has a clogged sink, start there.\u201d\n\nJames looked offended. \u201cI was offering something more along the lines of sexual favors. Not muck work.\u201d\n\nRobbie laughed and raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou assume they are mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nJames suddenly gets it. \u201cLaura has a thing for plumbers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Laura has a thing for detectives\u2026obviously.\u201d Laura interjected with a glance around to make sure nobody could hear.\n\nJames looked at Robbie, comprehension slowly dawning, \u201cNoooooo.\u201d\n\nRobbie shrugged and grinned. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhhh. I shall be off to Oxfam to buy some disgusting baggy rags with which to display my plumber\u2019s cleavage.\u201d James said quietly but in a sultry voice. \n\nLaura rolled her eyes and whispered, \u201cJust make sure you clean up after any burst pipes.\u201d\n\nRobbie made chicken fettuccini for dinner. It was strangely black on top and sort of looked like melted pinkish snakes inside. Laura deemed it Tapeworm-surprise and took a shower until the water turned cold. \n\nRobbie stabbed at his plate and looked like he could spit nails.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWell, it tastes fine.\u201d James said indicating he wanted a second helping. \n\nRobbie dished the sloppy mess up and perked up a bit. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Just added a little tomato sauce. Didn\u2019t know it would make it that color.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mine her. She had 6 shouts today. All of them pretty icky.\u201d James said to soothe him.\n\nRobbie nodded, \u201cRained all day too. Guess we will just have to work to sweeten her up tonight.\u201d \n\nThey were a bit disappointed to find her sound asleep already. They came back down stairs and turned on the telly. James kept looking at Robbie and Robbie smiled and put his hand on James thigh. \n\nA few minutes later Robbie, never taking his eyes off the screen asked, \u201cSomethings on your mind. Better talk about it.\u201d\n\nJames sighed, and chewed the nail on his thumb. \n\nRobbie clicked the remote and shut of the screen, \u201cI made you a good meal of chicken and pink worms, so you nibbling your nails can\u2019t be out of hunger and usually means you are nervous, guilty or both. Come on, lad. What have you got rumbling up there in that head of yours?\u201d\n\n \u201cShe\u2019s asleep and\u2026you know it has always been the three of us. Not complaining, mind. Just\u2026do you think she\u2019d be bothered?\u201d James asked.\n\nRobbie looked over at James, \u201cI don\u2019t see why? You and she had a bit if fun, if I recall?\u201d\n\n\u201cBad example.\u201d James winced. \n\nThey were quiet for a couple of minutes.\n\nRobbie squeezed his hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just. We have a lovely time but, well, you and I have never\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething in particular?\u201d\n\nJames hung his head, humiliated. \u201cI want you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have me, lad.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026inside me.\u201d James said shyly.\n\nThat got Robbie\u2019s attention. He took a deep breath and blew it out. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, I understand,\u201d James covered quickly.\n\nRobbie met his eyes and tilted his head. \u201cOf course I want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be selfish. It\u2019s just the first time. I would like it to be\u2026\u201d\n\nRobbie took a deep breath and held it as he considered, he finally said, \u201cRight. Suppose that would be for the best because who knows. We may be bollocks at it.\u201d\n\nJames frowns, \u201cYou never?\u201d\n\nLewis shakes his head with a smirk. \u201cNo, lad. We never got up to that. Painfully tame by today\u2019s standards, in fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d He seemed surprised and disconcerted. He was quiet then finally glanced at Robbie.\n\nA small patient smile was on his face as he waited for James to look at him. Robbie squeezed James\u2019 knee reassuringly. \u201cWe are bloody good detectives. I bet with your brain and my hard-headedness, we can figure out the fiddly bits. So long as you trust me.\u201d\n\nJames blushed and smiled, peeping at Robbie as he nodded. \n\n", "31": "\nChapter Text\n\nAn hour later James looked into Robbie\u2019s eyes as he slowly pushed into his body. It was more painful than James expected but he\u2019d dreamed of it for so long that it simply added to his arousal. His eyes rolled back and he moaned softly. \n\nRobbie froze and breathing deeply he shook as he restrained himself and croaked out, \u201cJames?\u201d\n\nJames nodded but couldn\u2019t seem to make words. \n\n\u201cThere are not enough soft words in the world to tell you how much you mean to me, bonny lad. Please say if I need to\u2026stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d James whispered and wiggled a bit. \n\nRobbie pulled back slowly and moved forward again, like a bow on a violin. When he changed the angle from D to A, James groaned, eyes wide and whispered, \u201cOh God. That. Again. More.\u201d \n\nIt was a pathetically short interval before James was shuddering and holding his breath as his body gave in to this long awaited moment. The sounds he made and the spasms created once he let go took Robbie\u2019s will to fight and he followed James gritting his teeth as if in pain and closing his eyes as his brain whited out in sensation. \n\nThey lay in stunned silence. \u201cWe are going to do that again,\u201d James said with firm awe. \n\nRobbie snickered then said, \u201cOh Yes. But not tonight.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly that they didn\u2019t mean to tell Laura, but it turned into a very busy morning and they were both up and gone before she awoke. \n\nNobody was as good at chilled politeness as Laura Hobson. So both of them noticed, but, Dr. Cook was back and he always brought out the spitfire in her so they thought little of it. \u00a0\n\nThey spent most of the day trying to find someone who was willing to talk about their overdose victim. Strangely, after interviewing three people, a neighbor, a former professor and her landlady, they had three nearly identical descriptions right down to the choice of words used to describe her personality. \n\n\u201cShe was a scattered girl, but sweet. She made friends easily enough but they rarely stuck with her for long. She could be stubborn and tended toward silence rather than conflict. There was something odd about her as if she could read minds and didn\u2019t like what she found. Her roommate and she were not close. She had an affair with the fianc\u00e9 and the relationship was quite cold and distant since.\u201d \n\nIt was altogether a pretty unproductive day, not generating a single solid lead. James had spent some time searching through her social media but her friend list was massive and full of Candy Crush gamers and gift exchange pals rather than actual people she knew in the real world. \n\nThey returned to Laura\u2019s to find her still at work and not coming home any time soon. \n\n\u00a0\n\nRobbie slid up behind James who was chopping something or other for the salad he was beginning. James leaned into his embrace and hummed with satisfied contentment. \n\n\u201cLeave that. We will do take away later. I have something far better planned for your time.\u201d Robbie pulled him closer making certain there was no doubt in the younger man\u2019s mind that his intention involved getting starkers immediately. \n\n\u201cLaura will be hungry when she gets home,\u201d James hedged. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry now and not for a quick graze. I could barely keep me hands off of you today. Haven\u2019t been this peckish for\u2026well, a long time.\u201d Robbie\u2019s hand roamed lower and found his answer. \n\nJames let his own desire rumble in his chest as he turned in place and dropped his head to Robbie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou hid it well enough. I could barely move that I wasn\u2019t reminded and that led to reactions at the most inappropriate moments. Crime scene wood is still frowned upon so Ta for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Right. So, are you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDo finish that sentence? Am I too sore? No. Up for more rumpy-pumpy? Absolutely. Going to last longer than the first time? Doubtful. Madly in love with you? Unequivocally yes,\u201d James murmured as he planted kisses on the side of Robbie\u2019s neck for additional punctuation. \n\nRobbie slipped his hand down the back of James trousers, inside his pants and squeezed the firm flesh of the younger man\u2019s, artistically contoured from years of rowing, bum. His other hand guided James by the neck to bring their lips together. James was lustfully malleable and virtually arduous in his submissive desire. It was a heady feeling for Robbie to know that someone so closed off most of the time could let those barriers drop and be so vulnerable in his longing just for him. He had no idea what he\u2019d done in life to deserve it. \n\nThere was a trust factor here that made Robbie feel a tingle of power. In the back of his mind, he knew that this young beautiful creature would probably submit to any wish he could dream or imagine. It was a writhing bundle of serpents, that knowledge and understanding. \n\nOn the one hand it was flattering to be wanted to that level and an honor to be trusted so completely. Sure, it was a huge temptation to see how hard he could push and selfishly take what he wanted, but the knowledge alone was the libido bomb. Robbie would never ever hurt this lovely man and the awareness that he could damage him so easily also fed his own need to protect and serve, so to speak. \n\nJust as he had been with Val, he liked being the one to safeguard and shield James. It was no burden to him, that James was a bit fragile here and there. The possibilities of why James was fragile were things best kept in check because for Robbie, those things rumbled with a rage that Robbie was a little afraid to explore. The corners of that darkness were too monstrous to reveal. \n\nMonkfort had been pathetic and assuaged some of what he felt for the evil that had taken his Valerie. If someone intentionally harmed his James, the wrath of God would be welcomed by the poor soul when Robbie finished with him.\n\nAll of these thoughts were simmering in the cauldron of Robbie\u2019s long dormant pleasure seeking need and James\u2019 poverty of love was like jet fuel. His breath hitched and quickened and escaped his chest with a moan as his body, obsessed with the scent of James\u2019 skin and the willingness of the flesh under his fingertips, began to crackle with the instincts of a hunter. There was not enough time in the world to fully sate this new craving. \n\nA trail of clothing, left like breadcrumbs and stones followed them to the spare room as if hoping they would eventually follow it out of the twisting forest before it grew dark. \n\nAs Robbie entered James this time, he lost his ability to offer controlled gentle caresses and his selfish body took over as if something inhuman thrashed at the puppet strings. Robbie could see himself pounding into James as if he had no other purpose on earth but the sensations were beyond his ability to master. The world was red with his need. \n\nJames was cheering the monster inside Robert on with his loud grunts and Lewis had never heard the sort of words loudly egging him on, come out of his uptight former sergeant\u2019s mouth. \u201cHarder. Break me\u2026God yes\u2026fuck me, Robbie. I would do anything to make you come. I can\u2019t \u2026oh please \u2026 frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam ,\u201d James said as he convulsed and added his seed to the bounty of sweat on their abdomens. \n\nRobbie was beyond words and his own pleasure sounded similar to someone taking an unexpected fall as James\u2019 body clamped and kneaded him prolonging his shudders with tight clinching that blocked his flow then relaxed to welcome and draw his essence before clamping down again, as if torture were part of the pleasure itself. Robbie screamed in a final surrender as he collapsed and continued to shudder with aftershocks, unable to control any part of his body, simply swept away with a tide of sensation in pure helpless animal pleasure. Breath itself was a secondary consideration and he simply rode out the wave unable to do more than hope he didn\u2019t sink below the water and never come back up. \n\nRobbie\u2019s very lips buzzed with each beat of his heart as he tried to form words, \u201cTell me I haven\u2019t damaged you, me lad?\u201d \n\nJames laughed and it sent painful sparks to Robbie and he reacted by pulling out to escape the now painful sensation. \u201cOh God. Lad. We didn\u2019t even use a johnnie. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 let burst a wince of displeasure. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t hurt me before, but the dismount could have been better executed\u2026Fuck.\u201d \n\nRobbie clumsily moved his head to the scene of the crime and in a matter of fact manner examined James for any sign of injury or blood. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShush, you. I was not in control of that and You will not lie to me or hide it if I have done you harm.\u201d \n\nJames sucked in his breath and waited, turning pink with humiliation. \u201cEnough. Obviously, I am fine and you are just perving.\u201d \n\nRobbie snickered. \u201cDetective Inspector\u2026Hathaway, isn\u2019t it? You are a vison. Give a poor old man a moment to admire his handywork.\u201d \n\nJames\u2019 eyes bulged slightly in incredulity. \u201cPoor old man? Seriously? You just buggered me into the bloody mattress. If this is how you perform in your doddering, I wouldn\u2019t have survived the experience ten years ago.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, no doubt. But then again I had not denied my craving of you for such a long expanse of time so the two may have equaled out and you\u2019d just be tired of me by now,\u201d Robbie replied with loving sarcasm. \n\n\u201cDoubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love,\u201d James quoted.\n\n\u201cI doubt I ever thought of Shakespeare while covered in fluids best not viewed under a black light.\u201d Robbie smirked and lovingly ran his finger through James\u2019 short cropped hair. \u201cThink we can both squeeze in that little shower at the same time?\u201d \n\n\u201cPerhaps, if we can forego the hope of sword crossing. I am done for, you randy old man. You have utterly shagged the life out of me.\u201d James sighed and smiled with apologetic but contented love. \n\n\u201cI have never lost control like that. Not once in me life. I don\u2019t quite know what to think of it just yet,\u201d Robbie confessed. \n\n\u201cI thought it brilliant, if it happens to matter. You leave me shattered. Every time I think that it can\u2019t get any bigger, it transforms my view of the eons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that posh for I rock your world?\u201d Robbie deadpanned in his best Geordie. \u201cYou were praying in the end there, again.\u201d\n\nJames cleared his throat and smirked. \u201cIt was Latin. It was anything but prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say, then?\u201d\n\nJames chewed his lip and shrugged a little, \u201cIt was a quote from the poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus and it basically translates to \u2018I want to draw your cartoonishly large cock on the public tavern\u2019 for the world to see.\u201d\n\nRobbie looks scandalized. \u201cRight. Why the bloody hell would you want to do that?\u201d\n\nJames rolls his eyes and snorts a laugh. \u201cIn the moment, I wanted to brag to anyone that I was currently impaled upon Excalibur \u2026so to speak.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you. I think. Go on with you and your catoonishly large brain. Maybe the water will cool it off a bit, I think it is smoking.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of smoking\u2026\u201dJames looked like he could chain smoke a whole pack. \n\n\u201cShower first. I might want to snog you while I soap your willie. Never had any complaints before\u2026just normal size you daft sod.\u201d Robbie tossed over his shoulder. \n\n\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t complaining, but don\u2019t pretend that is less than truncheon sized, Sir. Felt pretty massive from my personal perspective. Until you consider the reverse position, you will just have to take my word.\u201d James lectured as he turned on the taps and adjusted the water. From behind him he heard a frustrated sigh. \n\nJames turned to see what had happened or what he\u2019d said that caused that sound. He burst out giggling between the look on Robbie\u2019s face and the massive erection he was again sporting. \u201cWell, I would say that is an affirmative answer to that question. Glad we got that sorted.\u201d \n\nRobbie narrowed his eyes and growled, \u201cShut up. Just stop talking, right now.\u201d\n\nJames stepped into the shower and Robbie followed only to discover that James and he did not fit in the small enclosure without some sword crossing logistical issues. The warm soapy water and the twinkle in both of their eyes ended in a need for a second wash in fast cooling water and both of them leaning on the wall to keep from collapsing in trembling exhaustion. \n\n They pulled on pajamas and would both have preferred a collapse into the welcoming bed, but they could hear Laura had finally arrived home and felt obligated to greet her and find something edible before bed.\n\n Laura was home and still snippy. \n\nShe was standing at the counter forking Chinese onto her plate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI ordered in, seeing nothing but some salad scraps and a mess on my counter to indicate any plans for some ungodly semblance of a meal gone slightly off the scale of appetizing.\u201d \n\n\u201cSorry. I was making a salad but Robbie \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care. At this moment, I am tired and famished and I have had to hold my tongue all bloody day and do six times the normal amount of work. Not even speaking to me would be your best option for the moment.\u201d She brushed past James without meeting his eyes and added, \u201cHelp yourselves. Then kindly tidy up your mess and if it isn\u2019t too much trouble, unclog my sink you buggered up with man-debris. \u201d \n\nRobbie and James exchanged fearful glances and silently bumped shoulders in solidarity before entering the sitting room with full plates and an extra cuppa for Laura. \n\n", "32": "\nChapter Text\n\n\u00a0\n\nLaura\u2019s mood had not improved. James and Robbie looked guilty and Lizzy looked confused as they spoke to her about the PM on their dead girl. \n\n\u201cSo she defiantly died of an overdose?\u201d Robbie asked not knowing why she was acting so clipped and disgusted.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Laura nearly shouted. \n\nRobbie looked down at the report and read aloud, \u201cComplications associated\nwith acute reaction to heroin overdose?\u201d He looked up at her as if she had lost her mind. \n\n\u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d Laura nodded.\n\nJames frowned and Lizzy looked to James to clarify that she was not following this whole conversation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry, Laura, but I don\u2019t think I am following you?\u201d James asked with his most patient calm face plastered in place. \n\nLaura sighed and parked her bum on a stool. \u201cI know. We don\u2019t understand either and that is the problem. Heroin overdose is a myth.\u201d\n\nLizzy smiled one of those kind smiles she reserves for those who have gone completely round the twist. \u201cBut, people die of it all the time. What do you mean by myth?\u201d\n\nLaura leaned back against the wall, obviously tired. \u201cOkay. First look at the wording. Nobody dies of a heroin overdose. They die from that phrase right there which is our secret catch all for what we have no explanation for.\u00a0\u00a0 It is habit. Here is the thing, there have been studies in which people were given extreme overdose among both addicts and those who had never taken heroin before. Some survived ten times the lethal dose without a change in heart rate. With medical supervision, there is no reason for anyone to ever die from an opiate like morphine or even street heroin. We have the antidote. There are other factors. Without medical intervention, a person can go into a coma and die from respiratory failure, which is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cA complication of overdose, but not the direct result of pharmacological poison from the overdose,\u201d James volunteered. \n\nLaura pointed at James and grinned, \u201cPrecisely. Now for the thing that most often gets them? Class?\u201d \n\n\u201cMassive pulmonary edema,\u201d Lizzy answers at once. \n\nLaura nods. \u201cFor some unexplained reason, both addicts and first time or casual users suddenly collapse. Their lungs fill with fluid and thus the pretty froth we all know and love. Once it was assumed that this was a sign that heroin or \u2018opiate of the day\u2019 had caused this. Too much? Mixed with something horrible? Bad batch? Took something like barbiturates or alcohol too?\u00a0\u00a0 All of those things complicate our answer, but here is the other side. Most addicts are very predictable. True, they slowly increase their dosage over time but they know where their high is and that is all they want. It is their normal. They have rewired their brains. Yes?\u201d \n\nThe other three nodded.\n\n\u201cOkay, this is usually not some lonely person shooting up in secret, though of course that happens too. But lots of the time these kids are sharing their batch with six or ten of their closest fellows. Thus we have an epidemic of blood born diseases in the population. If a bad batch was the answer, they would die as a group. But it is always just one. Also, death from over indulgence of this sort of substance takes at least an hour. They fall into a stupor then coma and they sometimes take twelve hours to expire when this has been used as a very expensive suicide. They just get so sedated they stop breathing. So what causes one person to suddenly collapse and be dead within minutes like our girl here? We don\u2019t have a bloody clue so we hide it in mumbo jumbo and perpetuate this myth. That is what I mean and what I said.\u201d Laura finished. \n\n\u201cThen the question is? Was she murdered if this is unpredictable?\u201d Robbie asked.\n\n\u201cNo. It is murder if she were injected against her will or if that syringe were full for her alone. She would have been sedated enough to stop breathing. The concentration will be known once I get those results back. The thing about heroin is that it is hard to know what was there at the time of death. It dissipates if you will. We can detect it was there sometimes, but I will have to estimate the concentration and dosage size. There won\u2019t be a blood test telling you she had such and such amount in her system.\u201d \n\n\u201cCould someone have figured out how to trigger the collapse?\u201d James wondered out loud.\n\n\u201cIt is possible. But, researchers have been trying to figure it out in order to prevent it since the seventies. I won\u2019t say it is impossible, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cImprobable.\u201d James finished.\n\n\u201cSo it is murder, but we have bugger-all to prove it is homicide.\u201d Robbie sighed.\n\n\u201cYou Get the prize!\u201d Laura said pointing at Robbie!\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t convict, there is not much point in pursuing.\u201d Robbie said with frustration. \u201cWhat a waste.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoody will have a woobly.\u201d Lizzy agreed.\n\n\u201cHold on.\u201d James said. \u201cYou explained this to us. Who else would know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who has dealt with it before.\u201d Laura shrugged.\n\n\u201cWe can still solve it. Charge the help-mate with accessory or failure to seek medical aid for a person in life threatening distress. We can trump up all sorts of things once we figure out who it was.\u201d Lizzy added at once on the same page as her boss. \n\n\u201cGood. Now go away. I have a migraine. And his name is Dr. Cook.\u201d \n\nLizzy, James and Robbie sat outside a little coffee shop and enjoyed the 30 seconds of sun they were blessed with for the week. It was a little chilly and damp, but the sun peeping from the clouds now and again made it worth it. They went round and round discussing what they had learned from Laura. \n\nIt was a difficult thing to wrap their head around in the whole. The person who injected the girl may have planned for her to die and she did, but was that coincidental because intent would be hard to prove with just an estimated dosage. What if they pursued and found a poor lass in worst circumstance then her junkie-BFF had been, who had shared part of the dose? Then it became even more murky, depending on intent. So, it was vital that they find out what had happened before they decided. Moody would weigh the benefit of investigation further if they told him what they knew so far and it was standard practice to just let it be ruled as closed unless further evidence was introduced.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nJames grew quiet as he contemplated the fact that one conversation could change your perception of all you believed. It was happening rather regularly to him these days and he silently thanked his creator for allowing him so many chances to finally get life figured out. \n\nRobbie glanced at James and did a double take. His James was radiating happiness. He had never seen it on the man\u2019s face for more than a flash from time to time. Lewis leaned back in his chair and sighed in contentment. \u201cSirs? You might want to tuck your bromance back in a bit. Not only is it showing, but you have lost the plot entirely.\u201d Lizzy said calmly as she sipped her coffee. She pulled out her mirror and realised the two of them had been silently letting her sit in public with a huge glob of foam on her nose. \n\nThey burst out laughing. \n\n\u201cI work for juvenile tossers,\u201d She announced to the sky, then joined in.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nI did the best I could, explaining about the heroin myth. Here is a good article on it if you are interested. Of course I had to simplify it for the purposes of the story.

The still-empty desk. Right, James is still on holiday. Back the day after tomorrow, though.It\u2019s been a long week.He turns at a tap on the door-frame. \u201cMorning, sir. What would you like me to do today?\u201dRobbie just about manages to hold back a sigh. DS Barnes, the main reason it\u2019s been a long week. A very long week. \u201cHave you finished going through the witness statements?\u201d\u201cNot yet, sir.\u201d Barnes\u2019s relentless enthusiasm is as evident in his tone as in his smile. Robbie would give a lot to have been spared both.\u201cThen I suggest you continue with those. Report to me when you\u2019ve finished.\u201d He turns away, heading to his desk. Thank Christ Innocent didn\u2019t insist on Barnes using Hathaway\u2019s desk. He boots up his computer and scans his email, deleting the irrelevant, reading the significant, and leaving the rest for some indeterminate time when he\u2019ll have the opportunity to get to it. Course, if James were here, he\u2019d simply forward half the messages on for the bloke to deal with. But he\u2019s not. Not until the day after tomorrow.Thinking of Hathaway makes Robbie check his mobile. But no, no new texts. Ah well, maybe later. Hathaway\u2019s on a touring holiday in the Czech Republic, sightseeing around Bohemia and Moravia, spending far too many hours in old cathedrals, no doubt. Robbie\u2019s been encouraging him, by return texts, to visit a couple of vineyards and sample the nightlife once he gets to Prague \u2013 which should have been yesterday, actually. Ah, maybe the lad\u2019s actually out properly enjoying himself, which he should be doing. Too busy to send his old governor a message, and that\u2019s as it should be.Time to check his voicemail. Two messages. The first\u2019s from Forensics, letting him know that a report\u2019s ready to be picked up. That\u2019s one for Barnes, then. Robbie forwards the message. The second message is baffling at first. It\u2019s a woman\u2019s voice, heavily accented, and to begin with Robbie can\u2019t make out anything she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s not until the word Prague filters through his consciousness that he stills, and then quickly goes back to the beginning of the message.Listening very carefully with the volume increased, he finally gets the gist of it. The woman\u2019s a nurse at a hospital in Prague. She is calling at the request of James Hathaway, to pass on his apologies because he will not be back at work on the fifteenth as planned. He has been in an accident, unfortunately. But, the nurse assures Robbie, he will recover well and will be able to return home in due course.Robbie slumps back in his chair, staring into space. Hathaway \u2014 James \u2014 has been in an accident, and hurt badly enough that he\u2019s admitted to hospital and can\u2019t phone Robbie himself. And all he says is he\u2019s sorry he won\u2019t make it back to work on time. Bloody hell. How badly is the man hurt? And, Christ, if that\u2019s the message he\u2019s sent to Robbie, what\u2019s he said to anyone else? Does he have friends \u2014 not family, Robbie\u2019s certain \u2014 who\u2019ll go out there to make sure he\u2019s all right? See that he gets home safely?How badly is he hurt?A few seconds\u2019 searching on his computer gets him the phone number of the hospital where the message came from. But the nurse who phoned him is off-duty, and no-one else will give him any information since he\u2019s not a relative of the person he\u2019s calling about. They won\u2019t even confirm that James is a patient there. Even Robbie telling them that he\u2019s a copper makes no difference.He hangs up and, instead, contacts the Prague police headquarters. Ten minutes later, after he finds someone who speaks English well enough to carry on a conversation, he has the information he needed. A British tourist, identified on arrival in hospital as James Hathaway, was travelling in a taxi yesterday afternoon which collided with a 4X4 after the latter vehicle ran red traffic lights. Mr Hathaway, he\u2019s told, sustained several broken bones, including one leg, and is likely to be in hospital for a number of days. The police had been asked to help in tracking down any relatives for Mr Hathaway, and had intended to contact the British Embassy this morning for that very purpose.\u201cCan help you there,\u201d Robbie says, keeping his voice very calm despite the worry he\u2019s battling. \u201cHe\u2019s got no immediate family. If there are relatives, they\u2019re not close. I\u2019m his governor \u2014 his boss,\u201d he explains. \u201cHe\u2019s an officer with Oxford Police.\u201d Robbie provides his contact information, and takes the information of the duty officer he\u2019s speaking to, then ends the call. His next stop is Innocent\u2019s office.Innocent\u2019s first step, after expressing genuine dismay and seeking assurances about the extent of James\u2019s injuries, is to check James\u2019s personnel file. Contrary to regulations \u2014 which results in pursed lips from Innocent \u2014 James has no registered next of kin or emergency contact. \u201cAnd you were aware that this was the case, Lewis?\u201d\u201cNot aware, ma,am.\u201d Robbie rubs his eyebrow. \u201cSuspected \u2014 but only since the Crevecoeur case.\u201d And that certainly hadn\u2019t been the time to question James about whether or not he had any living relatives. \u201cAnd, of course, he could have listed a friend.\u201d Could have, but who? Not that James is likely to have mentioned friends to him, anyway, as private as the bloke is \u2014 but if he had friends, people he was close to, would he have been all... existential flu, as he\u2019d put it to Robbie, last month?Innocent nods, the creases in her forehead deepening. \u201cAnd are your plans what I suspect them to be?\u201dRobbie shrugs. \u201cI do have some time in lieu.\u201d To his surprise, Innocent seems relieved at that. She taps her fingers on her desk for a second or two, then turns to her computer and types for a moment. \u201cYou are now Sergeant Hathaway\u2019s temporary emergency contact \u2014 and you can tell him from me that I expect him to provide a name himself as a matter of urgency. And as his named contact, you\u2019re entitled to up a week\u2019s leave in this situation. Now, you said you have a contact with the Prague police?\u201dRobbie provides the officer\u2019s name. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. I appreciate this.\u201d \u201cI hope Sergeant Hathaway appreciates it.\u201d Her tone\u2019s dry. \u201cNow, is there anything on your desk that needs urgent attention?\u201d Robbie assures her that he\u2019ll make sure Barnes is fully briefed, and that in any case his current investigation is relatively lacking in urgency. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019d best be off. Keep me updated, won\u2019t you?\u201d He nods immediately. Her concern, he well knows, is from both personal and professional perspectives; Innocent genuinely cares about her officers\u2019 well-being.And, with that, he\u2019s free to go and make his travel arrangements.\nAround mid-afternoon the following day, Robbie\u2019s driving through the centre of Prague, using GPS to guide him to the hospital where James is a patient.It had been early afternoon by the time he\u2019d left Oxford the previous day, what with the information-gathering and preparation that needed to be done first. Innocent had contacted both the Prague police and General University Hospital to notify them of Robbie\u2019s official status as James\u2019s emergency contact, and to request assistance from the Czech police as needed. As a result, they\u2019d received a full list of James\u2019s injuries. The leg Robbie already knew about: broken a few inches above the ankle. Two fractured ribs. Concussion as a result of a head injury \u2014 hitting his head against the door-frame, apparently. Lots of bruising, including severe bruising to his left wrist and side. Robbie had taken the printed information straight to Laura, who\u2019d scanned it and given him a run-down of the implications. \u201cRibs \u2014 typical seatbelt injury from this type of impact. They\u2019ll be painful for a while and will restrict his movement, but then he won\u2019t be moving much for a while. The pain and swelling from bruising may take a week or two to go away, and for a while it could almost be as painful as broken bones. Concussion \u2014 well, you know the risks from that. You\u2019ll know in a day or two whether there\u2019ll be any problems there. That aside, the biggest issue\u2019s the leg. All the same, if he had to break a leg, this is almost the best type of fracture to have. I\u2019d need to see the X-rays to be absolutely certain, but the description of a closed simple fracture of tib and fib suggests he should heal well. Anything more complicated could mean the end of his career in CID.\u201d\u201cChrist,\u201d Robbie\u2019d muttered. That hadn\u2019t occurred to him, but it should have.Laura had rubbed his arm comfortingly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t happen. Now, depending on whether they do surgery or just reduce the fracture and set the bones, he\u2019ll either have a walking boot or a full-leg cast. Surgery can sometimes be the better option, but it depends on the person and the injury. Sometimes the recovery is faster from surgery, but there are always risks.\u201d She\u2019d smiled suddenly. \u201cWhichever option they choose, you should warn James that smoking will delay and might even harm his recovery. It impacts the repair of soft tissue damage.\u201dOh, great, Robbie\u2019d thought. Bad enough that James would be in a lot of pain and, understandably, grumpy, as well as frustrated by his enforced inactivity. But if he\u2019s told he can\u2019t smoke as well... this is going to be a long, unhappy recovery period.Laura had confirmed his intention to drive rather than fly; returning to the UK by plane once James is fit to travel might well be a lot quicker than this twenty-four-hour journey encompassing the Chunnel as well as an overnight hotel stay \u2014 Robbie had stopped for the night in Cologne \u2014 but would be supremely uncomfortable for James, regardless of whether he\u2019s in a cast or a walking boot, and the broken ribs might even prevent him from flying anyway. At least driving they can take their time, and James can change the seat position, or even sit sideways on the back seat, to get more comfortable.The journey hasn\u2019t been too bad, really: straightforward motorways all the way through France, Belgium and Germany, and once he reached the Czech border there was even a motorway pass waiting for him \u2014 the police in Prague had warned him that he\u2019d need one, and he\u2019d anticipated a delay and hassle getting that organised, particularly as he speaks not a word of Czech.Finally, he\u2019s in the hospital car park and he can get out and stretch his tired limbs. Seven hours, it\u2019s been, since he set off this morning. But he\u2019s here now, at last, and ready to see just what sort of state his sergeant is in.\nJames is in a four-bedded room, with curtains drawn on three sides. When Robbie peers around the open curtain, the bloke\u2019s got his eyes shut, so he can take a few moments to observe. James\u2019s leg is elevated, and he\u2019s got a long plaster cast on, with his knee bent upwards; oh, he must hate that. His face is pale and drawn, though one side of his jaw is shaded dark with bruising. Unsure whether he\u2019s asleep or just resting, Robbie steps forward. \u201cJames?\u201d\u201cWha\u2014\u201d James\u2019s eyes fly open. \u201cSir?\u201d He jolts in the bed, and immediately winces. \u201cSteady, there.\u201d Robbie comes closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do any more damage to yourself than that bloody bastard already did.\u201d \u201cBut...\u201d There\u2019s confusion and disbelief on James\u2019s face, and his voice is actually shaking. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d\u201cHow? Car, Chunnel and a fair bit of driving.\u201d Robbie drops into the chair next to the bed, not because he really wants to sit, but because standing looking down at James probably isn\u2019t the nicest thing to do, from the lad\u2019s perspective. He\u2019s reminded suddenly of another occasion when he stood next to James\u2019s hospital bed, that time very much as the lad\u2019s governor. James\u2019s slight scowl at Robbie\u2019s deliberate misunderstanding of his question makes him smile. \u201cI\u2019m here because...\u201d He considers You shouldn\u2019t be alone, but dismisses it; James will assume that he\u2019s motivated by pity. Instead, he finishes, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, so where else would I be?\u201dJames\u2019s eyes widen, and after a moment he looks away, flushing pink. Robbie won\u2019t mention the sheen of moisture he spotted, but it reinforces his conviction that he\u2019s done the right thing. \u201cI... never expected... it\u2019s far too much...\u201d James still isn\u2019t looking at him, and his hand clenches on the bedcover. Then he looks back at Robbie. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d He sounds choked up, overwhelmed.Robbie shrugs. \u201cYour replacement wasn\u2019t much cop. Couldn\u2019t wait until you\u2019re able to get back home under your own steam.\u201d Of course James will be well aware that\u2019s not the real reason, or anything like it, but easier for both of them not to say it out loud, isn\u2019t it?\u201cWhat, you\u2019ve come to take me home?\u201d Beneath the dry tone, the longing\u2019s evident.\u201cSoon as you\u2019re fit to travel. They seem to reckon four or five days might do it.\u201d James groans. \u201cI won\u2019t be walking by then, will I?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t think so. You\u2019ll be hopping along on crutches, or in a walking boot. Good thing the BMW\u2019s a big car.\u201d\u201cYou brought your official car?\u201d James stares.\u201cInnocent okayed it. Which reminds me\u2014\u201d He pulls a face. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to chastise you for failing to record an emergency contact on your personnel record.\u201d James looks away again. \u201cConsider yourself chastised, Sergeant,\u201d Robbie adds dryly. \u201cAnd, by the way, you do now.\u201d He jerks a thumb at himself as James turns back to him. \u201cNeeded it to get information from this lot about you. Might as well leave it like that, unless there\u2019s anyone you\u2019d prefer to list?\u201dSilently, James shakes his head. \u201cWell, then.\u201d Robbie studies the lad. He\u2019s in a lot of pain, that much is obvious \u2014 but of course he wouldn\u2019t say anything if Robbie actually asked him. He is glad that Robbie\u2019s here, but it\u2019s clear that embarrassment and awkwardness about Robbie\u2019s presence are starting to set in. Because he hates his boss knowing that he\u2019s got no-one else to care about him? \u201cCame straight here,\u201d he says then. \u201cDidn\u2019t think about stopping to get anything \u2014 I dunno, fruit, chocolate, something to read. Is there anything you\u2019d like? Anything you need?\u201d\u201cWell... If you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Bugger it, the lad\u2019s looking uncomfortable. How long\u2019s it been since someone did him a favour just to be nice?\u201cOffered, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cThen... yes.\u201d It\u2019s then that Robbie notices James\u2019s gaze is a bit unfocused. \u201cMy stuff\u2019s all in my hotel room. I was supposed to be checking out today. I would have phoned them to explain, but I think my phone must have gone missing in the accident.\u201dRobbie nods. \u201cI\u2019ll sort the hotel. No problem. Need a hotel meself anyway, so I might as well just take your room. That way your stuff can just stay there till we leave. Anything you want here, though? That iPod thing, maybe? And I\u2019ll talk to the police about your phone.\u201d\u201cMy iPod, yes. And my tablet. My glasses \u2014 apparently I can\u2019t wear lenses at the moment. Not sure why.\u201d James gives precise instructions as to where Robbie can find everything. \u201cSounds straightforward.\u201d Robbie stands. \u201cMight take a couple of hours to get everything sorted, but I\u2019ll be back.\u201dHe\u2019s about to walk out when a low-voiced \u201cSir\u201d makes him turn back. James briefly extends a hand towards him. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you came all this way \u2014 thank you.\u201dThe naked emotion as James speaks makes his heart ache. Christ, the lad must really be in a bad way to let him see it. But then he\u2019s been in this bloody hospital bed, on his own in a strange country, for two days, with no-one he knows to talk to, no visitors. James Hathaway, the very opposite of gregarious... Robbie can only imagine how difficult it\u2019s been.He folds his fingers around James\u2019s, squeezing lightly. \u201cGot me away from another week of piddling investigations an\u2019 cold cases, didn\u2019t it?\u201d He holds James\u2019s gaze for a long moment. There\u2019s no need to say any more. With a nod, he turns and leaves.\nWhen he gets back a couple of hours later, James is sleeping. The painkillers, the nurse tells him in heavily-accented English. Robbie\u2019s feeling a bit knackered himself \u2014 he\u2019d been sorely tempted to have half an hour\u2019s kip on the hotel bed, but he\u2019d worried that he\u2019d sleep longer than intended and then James would wonder where he was \u2014 so he eases himself into the chair again and lets his eyes drift closed.\u201cSir.\u201d Robbie mumbles something along the lines of \u2018go away\u2019. \u201cSir.\u201d The voice is more insistent. Reluctantly, he opens his eyes. James is leaning up on one elbow, looking at him in concern. \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201d He rubs his eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to fall asleep, sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d James shakes his head slightly, then winces. \u201cYou must be exhausted after driving all this way, sir. It\u2019s just that... I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for you to sleep in that chair. Your back...\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d He stretches out his spine and rotates his shoulders. Yeah, he would\u2019ve been sore if he\u2019d stayed like that much longer. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d James just pulls a face. Robbie reaches down for the bag he\u2019d brought back with him. \u201cThis might make you feel better.\u201d He takes out James\u2019s iPod and tablet and sets them on the bedside cabinet, and then adds his glasses to the collection.James does look a bit happier. \u201cThank you, sir. I really do appreciate you bringing those.\u201d\u201cGot some chocolate and fruit for you as well. Hope you\u2019re allowed to have them.\u201d Those go into the top shelf of the cabinet. James chews his lip. Robbie raises an eyebrow. \u201cCome on, out with it, man.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring me cigarettes, by any chance, did you, sir?\u201d There\u2019s a hopeful, longing look in James\u2019s eyes that Robbie finds he hates to disappoint. Which is not a reaction he\u2019s used to experiencing where James is concerned \u2014 but then, it\u2019s extremely rare that James reveals any kind of emotion, isn\u2019t it?But he shakes his head anyway, regret in his accompanying grimace. \u201cSorry. Even if you were able to get outside for a smoke, which I doubt they\u2019d let you do, you shouldn\u2019t. Laura tells me smoking damages the recovery process with a broken leg.\u201dJames looks sceptical, and his lips curl downwards. \u201cConvenient. I know she doesn\u2019t like my smoking.\u201dRobbie decides to ignore James\u2019s tone. The lad\u2019s having a bloody awful time and he\u2019s sure this won\u2019t be the last time James lashes out at something. \u201cLook it up on your tablet later.\u201d He pulls a face. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to see you with a permanent limp, meself.\u201dThat seems to shock James. He blinks, then looks down at his plastered leg. \u201cNo, I... erm, I wouldn\u2019t either.\u201dRobbie reaches across and pats James\u2019s uninjured hand. \u201cGonna be a difficult couple of months, I expect. Won\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re a bit irritable once in a while.\u201dJames smiles wryly. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m never irritable, but we both know that\u2019s not true, sir.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a grumpy sod at least half the time, so you\u2019ll be in good company.\u201d He gives James what he hopes is an encouraging smile. \u201cNow, seeing as you\u2019ll be sick of my company if I spend every waking hour in here, tell me what I should see while I\u2019m in Prague, all right?\u201d\nWhen Robbie arrives in time for visiting the following morning, James isn\u2019t in his bed. He looks around the room, but there\u2019s no sign of the lad, or any staff member he could ask, assuming anyone speaks English. The man in the bed opposite says something, but in Czech. Robbie shakes his head. \u201cSorry. I only speak English.\u201d Well, and a bit of German, but that\u2019s not going to be useful here, even if it had been on his journey through Germany.\u201cWalk. Exercise,\u201d the man says, the words heavily accented and awkward. Robbie nods. \u201cThank you.\u201d Christ, that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019ll be fun for James, though he understands the need to prevent loss of muscle function and so forth. He takes a seat by James\u2019s bed and waits. It\u2019s only a couple of minutes later that he hears clunking, followed by muffled curses, and glances up just in time to see James, awkward on crutches and grimacing from the effort, making his way into the room. He notices Robbie a moment or two later, and just for a second there\u2019s a flash of relief and delight in his eyes. He waits while the physio and a nurse help James back into bed and check his blood pressure and so on. Once they\u2019ve gone, James flops back against the pillow. \u201cChrist. If I could, I\u2019d arrest that bloody physio for GBH.\u201dRobbie gives him a sympathetic smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank him for it later. Broke me ankle once years ago. In those days, they made you stay off it for a week or more, an\u2019 by the time I got back on my feet I almost had to learn to walk again.\u201dJames winces and he\u2019s clearly seeing his own treatment in a different light, as Robbie\u2019d hoped. \u201cEnough about me,\u201d James says abruptly. \u201cWhat did you do this morning, sir? I hope you\u2019re getting a chance to see some of the city.\u201d\u201cI am. Took your advice and had a wander around Old Town Square this morning. Made a note of a few places I want to go back to before afternoon visiting.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d James starts, then hesitates before beginning again. \u201cI really appreciate you coming in to visit me, sir. But you don\u2019t need to come three times a day. Please, spend the day sightseeing, and then if you can bear my company I\u2019d appreciate it very much if you\u2019d come this evening.\u201dRobbie gives him a long-suffering stare. \u201cOi. You\u2019re the one who came to Prague to see the sights. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d He leans back in his chair. \u201cNow, tell me more about that train you fell asleep on near Karlov Vary...\u201d\nRobbie spends an hour or two walking around parts of Prague again the following morning, but this time he\u2019s not sightseeing. He\u2019s on the hunt for anything that might help to take James\u2019s mind off things.The lad\u2019s suffering badly, nicotine-deprived on top of the pain of his injuries and the frustration of enforced inactivity. He\u2019d got more and more intermittently silent and irritable yesterday evening, culminating in him snapping at Robbie several times and eventually telling him to leave him alone. Robbie\u2019d left, feeling it was probably the lesser of two evils at the time. When he gets up to James\u2019s ward, the bloke\u2019s lying back listening to his iPod. It\u2019s a moment or two before he realises he has a visitor, which allows Robbie a few seconds to study his sergeant. Even doing something which should be relaxing, James\u2019s brow is furrowed and he\u2019s paler than he should be. Not sleeping well, then, no doubt, on top of everything else.James\u2019s eyes open and he starts on seeing Robbie, but then there\u2019s relief all over his face. What, had he imagined Robbie wouldn\u2019t come back? Idiot.\u201cBrought you something,\u201d Robbie says once he\u2019s sitting and James is looking a bit more comfortable after he adjusted the lad\u2019s pillows. He leans forward to place his purchases on James\u2019s tray-table. \u201cMints, chewing gum, toffees, stuff like that. Thought maybe they might take your mind off not bein\u2019 able to smoke.\u201dJames\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cThank you. I...\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about yesterday, sir. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\u201cAh, forget it, man.\u201d Robbie waves a hand dismissively. \u201cNot as if I\u2019ve not seen you in the throes of withdrawal before. An\u2019 you didn\u2019t even choose it this time.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d James\u2019s lips turn down. \u201cI was calculating this morning how long I\u2019ll have to stay off them.\u201d\u201cMust\u2019ve been depressing for you,\u201d Robbie comments; it\u2019ll be a couple of months, he reckons, based on what Laura told him.\u201cLooking at it one way, yes. Or I could look at it positively and see it as way to give up properly.\u201d James shrugs one shoulder. \u201cBy the time I\u2019d be able to smoke again, I should have lost the craving, if I\u2019m lucky.\u201dAs long as he doesn\u2019t cheat along the way, of course.  Over the course of the day, in between James\u2019s physiotherapy sessions and other times Robbie has to leave, he chats casually about home, bringing James up to date on events and gossip around the nick and in Oxford generally. Even if the lad isn\u2019t showing a lot of interest, he knows James is listening and it\u2019ll keep him from brooding, Robbie thinks. Help him to focus on getting better and getting back to work.Except it doesn\u2019t because, just as Robbie\u2019s about to leave at the end of evening visiting, James says, \u201cWill I even be able to go back to work?\u201d\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean? Course you can,\u201d Robbie says immediately. \u201cBut what if... In some cases, a broken leg could lead to a permanent limp.\u201d James seems to be studying the plaster on his leg, as if examining every inch of it could give him insights into the healing process.Robbie nods. \u201cYours, though; it\u2019s a simple fracture, isn\u2019t it? Much less likely to lead to any permanent damage.\u201d\u201cBut still possible.\u201d James\u2019s gaze has shifted to his good leg. \u201cAnd if that were to be the case...\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d still have your job, man. Policies an\u2019 procedures, not to mention employment law. They can\u2019t just chuck you out. Have to find work you\u2019re physically able to do.\u201d\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t include my current job.\u201dNo; he\u2019s right there. He\u2019d fail the physical. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be focusing on worst-case scenarios, James. Doesn\u2019t do any good.\u201dJames is now pretending interest in the contents of his iPod. \u201cI need to be prepared \u2014 to find out what options I have if I can\u2019t...\u201d His voice becomes almost inaudible, but Robbie\u2019s pretty sure he hears. \u201c...be your sergeant any more.\u201d\u201cOi.\u201d He reaches across and covers James\u2019s hand with his own; it\u2019s the best way of making sure the lad knows he means this. \u201cYou\u2019re still me sergeant. That\u2019s not gonna change if I have anything to do with it.\u201d James finally meets his gaze, and his expression is sceptical. \u201cLook, all you\u2019re doing is borrowing trouble, but if it\u2019s what you need to hear: in the very unlikely event that you are left with a limp, there\u2019s still plenty you can do as me sergeant. Don\u2019t keep you on just \u2018cause you can run, y\u2019know. An\u2019 that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell Innocent too.\u201d He squeezes James\u2019s hand. \u201cNow, stop this, all right?\u201d He glances behind as a nurse coughs pointedly. \u201cAll right, I have to go. I don\u2019t want you brooding over this all night, now, mind. Promise?\u201dAfter a moment, James nods. It\u2019s not as much as Robbie\u2019d hoped for, but it\u2019ll do. With a quick farewell, he leaves before he gets thrown out.\nJames is right that a permanent limp or other weakness in his leg could be a problem \u2014 as Laura\u2019d pointed out back in Oxford. But Robbie\u2019s already made a point of reading the policies and, as he assured James, the bloke can\u2019t just be pushed out, either altogether or into a job he absolutely doesn\u2019t want to do. If the job of his bagman couldn\u2019t be adjusted to fit whatever limitations James was left with, then he\u2019d find another role in his team for the lad. End of story.And, if James didn\u2019t want that limited role, whatever it was, and actually resigned... it\u2019s a shock, and yet it\u2019s not, to realise that Robbie\u2019s own decision would be to apply for early retirement. If you go, I go... seems James isn\u2019t the only one who feels that way.Though now he\u2019s letting the lad\u2019s fears influence him. It\u2019s not going to happen. He\u2019s talked to Laura a couple of times, updating her on what he knows of James\u2019s injuries and treatment, and she\u2019s been very encouraging. According to her, though she insists he\u2019s not to quote her since she hasn\u2019t seen the X-rays or any other relevant information, as long as James behaves himself and follows medical advice he should recover fully.Though there\u2019s that as long as...Well, that\u2019s where he comes in, isn\u2019t it? Support, encouragement, motivation \u2014 even bullying, if need be. James would expect no less.\n\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cOh, look, double five.\u201d Robbie\u2019s grin feels like it\u2019s spread from ear to ear. \u201cThat means I get to bear off four pieces from the five-point, or below if I have less than four\u2014\u201d\u201cFewer,\u201d James murmurs. Robbie ignores him.\u201cAnd look! I only have four pieces left on the board, and they\u2019re all on the five-point or lower, so I win!\u201d He removes his pieces, then sits back and crosses his arms with a smirk.\u201cAn excellent demonstration of backgammon, sir,\u201d James comments dryly. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why it\u2019s not an Olympic sport.\u201d\u201cBackgammon\u2019s a highly respected game, I\u2019ll have you know,\u201d Robbie points out. \u201cBeen around more than five thousand years. \u201cI am aware, sir. It\u2019s recorded as having been played by the Byzantine Emperor Zeno in around 480,\u201d James counters. After a perfectly-timed pause, he adds, \u201cHe lost.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t have been any sort of decent player, then.\u201d Robbie grins. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can do better.\u201dJames rolls his eyes as Robbie starts setting the pieces up again for a new game, but Robbie can see what\u2019s behind the mock-protest. James is almost pathetically grateful for Robbie\u2019s attempts to distract him from the pain, the ongoing restrictions on his daily activities \u2014 and the routine humiliation of requiring the assistance of others to perform many daily activities \u2014 not to mention nicotine withdrawal and sheer boredom. When talking became challenging, simply because neither of them are natural natterers, Robbie came up with the idea of trying some board-games \u2014 not entirely easy, since the hospital\u2019s stock, as well as anything he could find in the shops, mainly consists of Czech-language games. There\u2019s chess, but although Robbie can play, he finds it not worth the effort. Over the last couple of days, they\u2019ve played most of the card-games both of them know, so Robbie suggested teaching James backgammon.Robbie wins the second game as well, but he\u2019s noticed that James\u2019s attention was wandering over the last few moves. \u201cTired?\u201d he asks as he tidies the pieces away.James pulls a face. \u201cRestless,\u201d he admits. \u201cFancy a walk?\u201d James now has a below-the-knee plaster, and Robbie was able to talk to the physio yesterday and negotiate permission to take James for occasional short walks, as long as he makes sure it\u2019s over flat surfaces and that James doesn\u2019t overdo it.\u201cI\u2019d love one.\u201dIt takes a few minutes to ease James carefully off the bed, avoiding any jarring to his ribs and ensuring that he doesn\u2019t put pressure on that still-painful left wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re moving better,\u201d Robbie comments once they\u2019re out in the hallway and James is building up a half-decent pace using two crutches and bending the broken limb at the knee.\u201cHelps not having a massive cast all the way up my thigh.\u201d Whether it\u2019s the pain of getting up and moving around, or just general cabin fever, James is even grumpy about positive changes. \u201cWill make it easier for you to get into me car tomorrow, all going well,\u201d Robbie points out, hoping the reminder of James\u2019s impending discharge will help. \u201cAlways supposing they don\u2019t find another reason to make me stay longer.\u201d That\u2019s accompanied by a scowl.By original projections, James should have been discharged today, but there\u2019d been some swelling under his cast and as a result his blood pressure hadn\u2019t been at a level his doctor was happy with, which had earned him another day\u2019s stay. His reaction to the news had been predictable: about as bad as a convict learning that his parole request was denied.Even with that complication, James is recovering well. The concussion symptoms cleared up within a couple of days of Robbie arriving, and the bruising around James\u2019s ribs and side is gradually reducing. He\u2019ll still feel considerable pain in those areas, as well as his wrist and forearm, for a couple of weeks yet, but his mobility is improving. And even despite the swelling, James\u2019s leg is apparently healing well and no further concerns are anticipated. Despite James\u2019s \u2013 and Robbie\u2019s \u2013 initial fears, he should make a full recovery and return to normal duties once he\u2019s declared fit.And that\u2019s been a relief. Not that James has said anything, though Robbie knows that the bloke is aware of his current prognosis. His surgeon briefed Robbie as well, as James\u2019s official contact. The bones are knitting nicely and, all going well, a couple of months should see him walking, and even running, without a limp. He may always have some degree of weakness in that leg, but under normal circumstances that won\u2019t be a problem. He\u2019ll keep his career, and he\u2019ll be back to playing squash and rowing and whatever else he likes to do before too long.James pauses as they pass a doorway. It\u2019s not a main exit, but leads to a small courtyard, with shrubs and a couple of smallish trees as well as grass, where patients who are mobile can stroll or sit. \u201cCan we go outside?\u201dRobbie\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not wanting to smoke, I hope?\u201dThe glare James gives him is startling; they\u2019ve had spats over the years, but he\u2019s never seen the lad that riled, or heard him that sarcastic. \u201cNo! Even if I had any cigarettes, you\u2019ve done an outstanding job as Dr Hobson\u2019s proxy. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be very proud of you, sir.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for his leg, James would have stalked off in high dudgeon, but instead his only options are to hobble further on or try to turn around, which isn\u2019t easy. Robbie elects to ignore the tirade he\u2019s been treated to and just opens the door, holding it for James to make his slow, awkward way through. Outside, James says, stiffly though without sarcasm, \u201cI\u2019ve been cooped up inside for days without any natural light and surrounded by the smell of disinfectant and hospital food and overheated bodies. I just wanted some fresh air.\u201d\u201cAll right, canny lad.\u201d Robbie\u2019s tone is soothing, and he gestures towards a bench.The courtyard is empty \u2014 not too surprising as it\u2019s a cool afternoon, with a sharp nip in the breeze that\u2019d make anyone regret coming out without a coat. The sky is cloudy and there\u2019s not even a tiny corner of the small area illuminated by sun. James, however, sinks onto the bench with a sigh of relief, seeming as content as if he were on a sunny beach.For several moments, he just sits with his head thrown back, inhaling and exhaling in deep, long breaths. Robbie can see James\u2019s agitation calming gradually, just as it does when the bloke smokes a cigarette after a long day or a difficult situation. Finally, James glances in his direction, shame in the pinkness of his cheeks and the barely-visible frown of his eyebrows. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have spoken to you like that, sir.\u201dRobbie waves a hand. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have assumed, should I? Anyway, you\u2019ll be out of here tomorrow. Can keep the car window down the whole way home, if you want. Plenty of air for you, though I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d necessarily describe it as fresh.\u201d He raises an eyebrow in enquiry. \u201cPick up any Czech while you\u2019ve been here? Could come in handy. I\u2019ve had to point and signal if I\u2019ve wanted to eat while I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\u201cKol\u00e1\u010d a pinta, pros\u00edm,\u201d James says, eyes closed. \u201cPie and a pint \u2014 I assume that should satisfy your discerning tastes, sir?\u201d\u201cSod,\u201d Robbie responds cheerfully. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of meals, then. At least until we\u2019re over the border into Germany.\u201dJames stiffens suddenly. \u201cYou must add up everything I owe you, sir. Travel, accommodation, food, everything. I\u2019ll pay you back as soon as we get to Oxford.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be daft.\u201d He keeps any heat from his voice, despite the instinctive offence he can\u2019t help feeling at James\u2019s words. \u201cLook,\u201d he adds, seeing the stubborn set of James\u2019s jaw, \u201cwait and see what the insurance company will cover, all right? They should cover repatriation at least, so I can give you petrol and ferry receipts if so.\u201d He couldn\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s damn about the money, but if it\u2019ll salvage a little of James\u2019s pride, then so be it.James nods at that, somewhat distractedly as his attention\u2019s caught by something a few feet away. A small green bird with a red head is clinging to the side of a tree, pecking away at the bark with its beak. \u201cEuropean green woodpecker,\u201d James comments, taking it for granted that Robbie\u2019s also seen the bird. \u201cThey\u2019re found in England as well, though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen one at this close quarters.\u201d\u201cSeen plenty of them in the Cotswolds.\u201d Robbie sits back, arms folded, and enjoys the surprised look that dawns on James\u2019s face. \u201cUsed to take the kids rambling in the hills on Sunday afternoons if I wasn\u2019t working. Learnt a lot about birds \u2014 enough to get the better of Morse a couple of times.\u201d\u201cI would\u2019ve liked to see that.\u201d James sounds wistful. It\u2019s something Robbie would have enjoyed witnessing as well; he\u2019s thought a few times over the years that he\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall for a conversation between James and Morse. His old governor would have either loved or loathed James; admired his brain, certainly, but hated his spirituality and his rigid sense of ethics \u2014 not to mention his attachment to modern technology. \u201cOh, it was interesting,\u201d Robbie says with a grin. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like it.\u201dAnother nod from James, his gaze still fixed on the woodpecker. His fingers are twitching where they rest on his lap \u2014 of course, he\u2019d normally have a cigarette in his hand by this point. The cravings must be tough on him, too. At that thought, Robbie remembers that he\u2019s got a packet of mints in his pocket, and passes it over. It\u2019s not nicotine, of course, and it\u2019s not the same as having something in your hand, but so far sweets of various kinds seem to be helping James. At least, he hasn\u2019t said otherwise.James nods his thanks and scoops a mint into his mouth, then turns to Robbie with a contrite expression. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have spoken that way about Dr Hobson either. It\u2019s very kind of her to have given you advice for me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t tell her if you don\u2019t.\u201d Robbie nudges the bloke gently. James gives an exaggerated shudder. \u201cNot bloody likely. Though I do mean it \u2014 it was kind of her.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Robbie nudges James\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd speaking of, she gave me a bit of advice this morning, too. Make sure you get plenty of rest before stuffing yourself, broken leg an\u2019 all, into a car for more than eight hundred and fifty miles. It\u2019s not gonna be easy for you.\u201d\u201cNor you.\u201d James glances in his direction, expression rueful. \u201cI can\u2019t even offer to share the driving.\u201d\u201cWell, you could, but we\u2019d probably end up in a ditch.\u201d Robbie bumps the lad\u2019s shoulder again, giving James an amused grin. \u201cCome on, Limping Lenny. Let\u2019s get you back to bed before they send out a search-party, eh?\u201dJames reaches for his crutch and pulls himself slowly to his feet, smirking through the obvious pain it causes him. \u201cThought you\u2019d never ask, sir.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a long and torturous drive home for James. Even with the passenger seat pushed fully back, he\u2019s clearly uncomfortable. It\u2019s not just his leg; the seatbelt\u2019s cutting across those broken ribs, and the bruises he still has get jarred every time Robbie turns a corner or hits a bump in the road. Even before they\u2019ve left Prague, Robbie knows he\u2019s going to have his work cut out to make this journey bearable for the bloke.Regular stops, he resolves. Even if James doesn\u2019t get out of the car, he\u2019ll have a break from being bounced around. \u201cRoads\u2019ll improve once we\u2019re over the border into Germany,\u201d he comments as he pulls into a service station with the excuse of needing coffee and a pee. James definitely needs the coffee, Robbie knows, and is hoping the shop here has something strong enough for his silently unhappy passenger.\u201cThank fuck for that,\u201d James mutters. \u201cSorry,\u201d he adds almost immediately. \u201cThat sounds incredibly ungrateful, and I really am so very grateful for what you\u2019re doing, sir. If you hadn\u2019t come, they said I\u2019d\u2019ve had to wait another forty-eight hours before being cleared to fly.\u201d Because of the risk of further swelling, of course. And even then, getting to and from airports on his own would have been tricky \u2014 not that Robbie would have left him to make his own way back from Heathrow in any case. Robbie waves a hand as he slides out of the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYou\u2019re in pain and getting knocked around all the time. Anyone\u2019d be grumpy if they had to suffer that. Even me.\u201d He catches a rueful half-smile from James. \u201cMind, flying would\u2019ve got you home a lot faster. One day, instead of three.\u201d\u201cStill better this way.\u201d James tilts his head back against the headrest as Robbie closes the door.Less than ten minutes later, he exits the shop to see James has got out of the car. He\u2019s leaning against the passenger door, looking off into the distance. Robbie follows the direction of his gaze. Two men are standing near the edge of the station area, smoking.\u201cGetting a vicarious fix?\u201d Robbie suggests as he approaches.James swings around, clear longing on his face. \u201cI was so close to hobbling over there and cadging a smoke. Or even getting close enough to smell the tobacco.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Robbie holds out his prize: freshly-brewed coffee so strong the spoon\u2019d almost stand up in it. \u201cIt\u2019s not nicotine, but it\u2019s practically a narcotic.\u201d\u201cI could kiss you, sir.\u201d James reaches for the coffee with as much gratitude as a desert survivor being offered water.\u201cLeast you wouldn\u2019t smell like an ashtray,\u201d Robbie comments with a smirk. \u201cCome on, give me that while you get back into the car. You can have it back soon as you\u2019re in.\u201d\u201cPromise?\u201d James means it humorously, Robbie knows, but he doesn\u2019t quite get it right, and the resulting vulnerability in the lad\u2019s voice almost breaks Robbie\u2019s heart.Outwardly, he ignores what he\u2019s heard, even though he wants nothing more than to give James a hug \u2014 and that\u2019s not an urge he\u2019s ever felt before. \u201cCome on, soft lad. Let\u2019s get you home.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still going to be a couple of days before he can deliver on that promise to have James home, though. He did the outward journey in under two days, of course, but he achieved that by driving up to eight hours each day, not including time spent waiting at Dover for the ferry. James won\u2019t be able to manage that. Robbie\u2019s already planning two overnight stops, in Mannheim and Calais, which reduces driving to between five and six hours per day.Because Robbie\u2019s stopped every ninety minutes or so to give James a break from being jolted and a chance to unfold himself from the passenger seat, it\u2019s early evening before they arrive in Mannheim. James found a hotel via some app thing on his phone, which he insists is far superior to Robbie\u2019s usual strategy of Googling for something that\u2019s at least close to his route. One room, two beds, Robbie\u2019d told James. Not because it\u2019s cheaper, but because he\u2019d rather be on hand in case James needs help with something. Knowing James\u2019s propensity to claim that he\u2019s okay when he isn\u2019t, there\u2019s every chance that the bloke would end up falling over getting out of the shower and not even shout for help.\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I thought you\u2019d be excited about now you\u2019re out of hospital,\u201d Robbie says as he drives into the hotel car park.\u201cSeveral, I\u2019m sure.\u201d James\u2019s tone is dry. \u201cNot least of which is missing the daily physio sessions.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not stopping the physio just because Boris isn\u2019t around to whip you into shape. Soon as we\u2019re up in that room, you\u2019re doing your twenty stretches or whatever,\u201d Robbie points out, sharpish-like. \u201cAs I keep telling you, his name\u2019s Boleslav, not Boris.\u201d \u201cClose enough, an\u2019 he\u2019s not here to correct me anyway. Not what I meant. Would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be desperate for a decent dinner instead of hospital food.\u201dJames pouts, but it\u2019s for effect, Robbie can see. \u201cWe\u2019re in Germany. Bratwurst and sauerkraut have never been high on my list of delicacies to eat before I die.\u201d\u201cAnd Mannheim\u2019s a cosmopolitan city. Steaks, pizza, pasta, fine French dining; you name it, you\u2019ll find it on that phone of yours.\u201d\u201cSteak,\u201d James announces instantly. \u201cBig, juicy steak with chips and veg, with a bottle of a decent red. Which means not German.\u201d\u201cOi. No wine for you. You\u2019re still taking painkillers.\u201d\u201cI can dream.\u201d James points out a parking space, and then they\u2019re ready to check in.\n\u201cI ate too much.\u201d But James is smiling as he lies propped up against the pillows on one of the room\u2019s two double beds. \u201cAnd even worse, it reminded me of all the food I\u2019ve been missing. The first thing I\u2019m doing when we\u2019re back in Oxford is ordering an Indian takeaway. Or Chinese. Or maybe even both.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll need to share, in that case,\u201d Robbie points out. \u201cGood thing I like both too.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d prefer to share a curry with, sir.\u201d James turns his head towards Robbie, and there it is: a genuine, happy Hathaway smile. After the last few days, it warms Robbie\u2019s heart to see it.\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Robbie can\u2019t stop the gruffness creeping into his tone, but James\u2019ll know he doesn\u2019t mean it unkindly.\u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before, sir.\u201d Now James is sounding awkward again. What on earth\u2014? \u201cI have no idea why you\u2019ve done all this for me, including putting up with my absolutely appalling moods, for which I apologise again. I can\u2019t possibly thank you enough. I hope you know how much I appreciate it, and if there\u2019s ever anything I\u2014\u201c\u201cStop it.\u201d Robbie cuts across him. \u201dYou\u2019ve already thanked me several times. That\u2019s enough.\u201d After a moment, he adds, \u201cAs for why \u2014 why not?\u201d It\u2019s not as if there was anyone else, he could add, but won\u2019t. The last thing he wants James assuming is that Robbie felt sorry for him.But isn\u2019t that exactly the reason he came? And yet... no. He doesn\u2019t feel sorry for James. Sympathy, yes, at the thought of the bloke injured and alone so far from home. But he came for himself, really, didn\u2019t he? Not for James, though of course James needed him and in the circumstances there was nowhere else he\u2019d be. But because he needed to be here for his own peace of mind: to be reassured that James was getting the best of care, that he wasn\u2019t alone and brooding, and so that Robbie could keep an eye on him until he\u2019s safely back in Oxford, where he should be and where Robbie can keep an eye on him daily.And with that, he picks up the TV remote and tries to find something on telly that\u2019s even halfway watchable, because the realisation that James\u2019s well-being, and his own involvement in James\u2019s well-being, matters that much to him is something he\u2019s not really ready to contemplate. And certainly not with the man himself in the next bed.\u201cOh, brilliant. Bayern M\u00fcnchen\u2019s playing Real Madrid.\u201d Satisfied, he puts down the remote and settles in for an hour or so\u2019s viewing pleasure, and deliberately ignores the groan from a few feet away. Given Robbie\u2019s driven halfway across mainland Europe and now back again for James, the bloke can bloody well put up with a football match.\n\u201cWe should be back in Oxford some time tomorrow afternoon, depending on traffic, ma\u2019am,\u201d Robbie\u2019s saying the next morning when the bathroom door opens and James emerges. He left the bloke to look after himself after seeing when he\u2019d got washed himself that the shower is a cubicle with well-positioned bars and only a very shallow lip, and they\u2019d got hold of a couple of plastic bags for James\u2019s cast.\u201cGlad to hear it. How\u2019s our injured sergeant?\u201d\u201cHopalong Cassidy, you mean, ma\u2019am?\u201d Robbie turns to grin at James, but pauses once he gets a proper look at the bloke. James is naked except for his cast, of course, and a towel around his waist. The entire left side of his body is black and blue. \u201cChrist, that looks painful, man!\u201d\u201cRobbie?\u201d There\u2019s sharp concern in Innocent\u2019s voice.\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am.\u201d James is shaking his head wildly, eyes practically imploring. Robbie gives him a long-suffering glare. \u201cNasty bruise on James\u2019s arm. It\u2019s got to the really colourful stage.\u201d Seeing a way to extract a bit of minor revenge for James demanding that he lie to Innocent, Robbie adds, \u201cProbably could send you a photo if you like.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Inspector.\u201d He can hear the frown in her voice, and Robbie grins. \u201cJust bring both of you back without any further injury. Understood?\u201d\u201cUnderstood, ma\u2019am.\u201d He ends the call, then sets the phone down and studies James again. \u201cThey give you anything for those bruises? Arnica or anything like that?\u201dJames shakes his head, sitting down on the edge of his bed, half-turned towards Robbie but with his right, unbruised side in Robbie\u2019s line of sight. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d \u201cYeah, right. And you weren\u2019t getting banged around all over the place in the car.\u201d Robbie picks up the phone again, this time selecting Laura\u2019s number. He\u2019s been giving her updates every couple of days, as with Innocent.James frowns, clearly suspicious. Robbie hits the speaker mode, and Laura\u2019s voice answering the call is loud and clear. \u201cRobbie! Any news? He must have been discharged by now, surely?\u201d The concern in her voice is apparent, and James notes it too; he looks slightly ashamed of himself. No doubt remembering again his bad-tempered comment in the hospital garden.\u201cDischarged and on our way home. We\u2019re in Germany, and I\u2019ve got James on speaker with me.\u201d Knowing Laura, she\u2019ll have questions, and this way\u2019s faster than Robbie relaying questions and answers.While Laura asks and James replies, Robbie finds himself watching his sergeant. Now that his focus isn\u2019t on James\u2019s bruises but on the lad\u2019s uninjured right side, his eye is caught by James\u2019s forearm and chest. He\u2019d known James was fit and strong; he\u2019d watched the bloke bear the weight of a man heavier than himself with just one arm, after all, and pull him to safety. He\u2019d known James used to be a competitive rower, and still rows casually. But he\u2019d never seen the taut, powerful muscles that normally stay hidden underneath the tight clothing James usually wears... \u201cRobbie?\u201d It\u2019s Laura, and by her tone it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s said his name.\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d\u201cHe is telling the truth, isn\u2019t he?\u201d About what? Robbie\u2019s missed it all. He glances at James\u2019s face, and unsurprisingly the cocky sod nods emphatically. He takes a chance. \u201cHe\u2019s recovering well, and not doing anything he shouldn\u2019t. But I was gonna ask you \u2014 is there anything you can recommend for bruises? They didn\u2019t give him anything, and he\u2019s in pain.\u201dJames glowers. Robbie just stares back until the lad gives a reluctant nod of acknowledgement.\u201cI don\u2019t know German brand names, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d recognise active ingredients, though you might be fortunate enough to find a pharmacist who speaks English,\u201d Laura answers. \u201cBut, if you can find it, witch hazel\u2019s the best option. Liquid, or gel if it\u2019s available.\u201d\u201cFair enough. Thanks, Laura.\u201d\u201cThank you, Dr Hobson,\u201d James adds quickly, and his tone is sincere. But then, James does genuinely like Laura. He just hates being fussed over or told what\u2019s good for him. \u201cAnd thank you for all the advice you gave Inspector Lewis. I do appreciate it.\u201dRobbie ends the call. \u201cRight, I\u2019m off out to find a pharmacy. Don\u2019t put your shirt on before I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cHang on.\u201d James has his own phone in his hand. In under a minute, he\u2019s reading out directions to the closest pharmacy, and \u2014 in poorly-pronounced German \u2014 telling Robbie what witch hazel is called here. \u201cZaubernuss.\u201d Robbie corrects him with a superior smirk, and heads out.\nA day and a half later, Robbie takes the Oxford exit off the M40. There\u2019s an audible sigh of relief from the passenger seat.\u201cNot long now, canny lad.\u201d Robbie starts calculating the best route to James\u2019s flat, but then it occurs to him that the bloke won\u2019t have any shopping in. And anyway, how\u2019s he going to look after himself properly with a leg in a cast and all those bruises? Robbie\u2019s had to help James into his shirts the last two mornings, after he saw the lad wincing in pain as he tried to bend his left arm back to get it into the sleeve. James has mostly been applying the witch-hazel gel himself, but Robbie\u2019s had to rub it on parts of James\u2019s shoulder and side the lad couldn\u2019t reach without pain.There\u2019s only one thing for it. Good job he moved to the bigger flat after Jack was born, so that he\u2019d have the spare bedroom for Lyn visiting.\u201cAnything you want to get from yours? No arguments,\u201d he adds quickly as James opens his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay at mine for a few days, at least until those bruises start to go.\u201d\u201cSir, I couldn\u2019t possibly impose\u2014\u201d\u201cI said no arguing.\u201d Robbie slows down for traffic lights. \u201cNow, anything you need first?\u201d\u201cWork clothes.\u201d James holds up a hand as Robbie\u2019s about to protest this time. \u201cI know my leg prevents me from resuming full duties immediately, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with my brain. I\u2019ll be returning to work tomorrow, sir. I hope you\u2019ll be willing to drive me, but if not I\u2019ll take taxis.\u201d\u201cCourse I\u2019ll drive you, you daft sod.\u201d Robbie shakes his head. \u201cStubborn as a mule, you are.\u201dJames smirks in a way that Robbie knows means there\u2019s smartarsery coming. \u201cI learned from the best, sir.\u201d\n\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\nThe following morning, the spare bedroom door is still closed by the time Robbie\u2019s up and dressed for work. \nHe puts the kettle on, then goes to see if his guest is awake. Sleep would be by far the best thing for James, but his stubborn sergeant had insisted in no uncertain terms before bed last night that he would be going to work today. Robbie wouldn\u2019t put it past the bloke to make his own way in, broken leg or no broken leg, if Robbie left without him.  \nHis knock is greeted with a sleepy, incoherent response. Robbie takes that as permission to enter. James, hair rumpled and shadows under his eyes, is clearly just waking up. \u201cMorning.\u201d Robbie raises an eyebrow. \u201cSleep well?\u201d\nJames rubs his eyes. \u201cYes, actually.\u201d He yawns widely. \u201cLot better than since the accident.\u201d He shifts in the bed, then winces. \u201cBloody ribs.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re overdue painkillers,\u201d Robbie points out. \nJames nods, then closes his eyes abruptly. \u201cHead still hurts.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Robbie knows better than to dole out advice. James is the sort who needs to realise the best course of action for himself. \u201cBring you some water, then, will I?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer, heading back out to the kitchen.\nBy the time he gets back, James is propped up against the pillows, looking very young and miserable \u2014 not quite as bad as when Robbie first got to the hospital in Prague, but he is reminded of yesterday, when he\u2019d finally got the bloke into his flat.\nJames had limped his way into the living room on both crutches, and then stopped dead, seemingly unable to go any further. Robbie\u2019d called his name a couple of times, but James hadn\u2019t responded, so he\u2019d gone over to the lad and laid a hand on his shoulder. James had turned slowly to look at him, and the only word Robbie can use to describe the expression he\u2019d seen on his sergeant\u2019s face is lost. The lad had just seemed to crumple, overwhelmed.\nBeing home \u2014 well, not quite, but close \u2014 is part of it, of course. There must have been times when James had felt as if he was never going to get out of hospital, or out of the Czech Republic. But the other thing that\u2019d occurred to Robbie as they\u2019d been driving back through Europe was that James had been injured while in a car. He\u2019d been perfectly safe, or so he\u2019d assumed, when the other driver had come out of nowhere. And then he hadn\u2019t been in a car again until Robbie picked him up from the hospital to begin the long journey back to Oxford. James hadn\u2019t said a word, but Robbie\u2019s certain that at least some of the lad\u2019s tension over the three-day journey has to have been trauma-related \u2014 fear that the same thing could happen again.\nNow, he\u2019s finally out of a moving vehicle and in a safe environment, isn\u2019t he? So he\u2019s letting go of the tension, whether or not he realises it.\nRobbie\u2019d done what had seemed instinctive: he\u2019d wrapped his arms around James and given the bloke a hug. Careful, of course, because of James\u2019s poor ribs and all those bruises, but a hug nonetheless. It had taken a moment, it seemed, for James to react, but then he\u2019d made an unintelligible sound and hugged Robbie in return, dropping his head to Robbie\u2019s shoulder and letting his crutches fall to the floor.\nThe hug had lasted all of about ten seconds before James had pulled away, muttered what sounded like an apology, and picked up his duffel-bag, slinging it over his shoulder, and then his crutches, using the kitchen counter for balance.. He\u2019d then stayed in Robbie\u2019s spare room a good ten minutes, emerging finally with a bland expression and unstoppable line in equally bland conversation, only dropping the performance when he\u2019d realised that Robbie wasn\u2019t going to bring up what had happened.\nRobbie\u2019d deliberately kept things low-key for the rest of the evening. He\u2019d ordered curry and put on a DVD, a documentary series James had given him last Christmas, meaning that conversation could be kept to a minimum. Then he\u2019d pleaded tiredness \u2014 not faked; driving well over eight hundred miles in three days had taken it out of him \u2014 and they\u2019d both been in bed before ten.\nHe\u2019d slept well and woken refreshed, but James looks like he could do with another few hours in bed, or at least resting on the couch. \n\u201cCoffee\u2019ll be ready in a couple of minutes,\u201d he says as he hands James the water and then shakes out the painkillers for him. \u201cWant me to bring you a cup?\u201d\n\u201cI should be\u2014\u201d James yawns again.\nRobbie perches on the side of the bed. \u201cNothin\u2019 you have to be doing, man. No skin off my nose if you want to stay an\u2019 watch daytime telly all day.\u201d\nJames looks pained. \u201cJust kill me now, sir. I\u2019m sure you could find somewhere safe to dispose of my body.\u201d \n\u201cToo late now to dump you in the Chunnel,\u201d Robbie points out with a cheerful grin. \nJames flexes his left hand; clearly, the wrist is still painful. \u201cI think I should stay here today, sir, if you don\u2019t mind. I wouldn\u2019t be much use to you in the nick, and it would be crass of me to make you feel you need to make sure I don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\n\u201cAbandoning me to yet more of Barnes, are you? I swear, that man\u2019s far too cheerful to be a human being, let alone a copper.\u201d Robbie snorts. \u201cHave to find somewhere to send him that\u2019ll take most of the day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you could invent a need for him to visit the county records office in Northampton,\u201d James suggests. \u201cYou\u2019re good at coming up with wild goose chases, sir.\u201d\n\u201cOi.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Barnes\u2019s usual governor, anyway?\u201d James asks. \u201cYou reckon it\u2019s Peterson? It should be. Might explain the heartiness.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not, it should be. Might have to suggest that partnership to Innocent.\u201d Robbie stands. \u201cBring you coffee before I go. Want anything to eat?\u201d\nAbruptly, the amused look disappears from James\u2019s face, to be replaced by a guilty frown. \u201cNo. No, please don\u2019t bother, sir. I\u2019ve been enough trouble as it is. I can fend for myself.\u201d\nRobbie sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re no trouble at all, man. Told you that.\u201d\nJames\u2019s lips twist. \u201cHow can you say that, sir, after everything you\u2019ve had to do for me? And even now you\u2019re finally back from Europe, you\u2019re having to cope with me in your flat.\u201d\nSitting on the bed again, Robbie snorts.  \u201cAnd you\u2019re such a difficult, demanding guest. Look,\u201d he adds, tone matter-of-fact; James won\u2019t respond well to sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble having you here \u2014 and you were right earlier: I\u2019d prefer to have you where I can keep an eye on you an\u2019 make sure you\u2019re not doing too much. As for coming to get you: yeah, I didn\u2019t have to do that. Wanted to. Wanted to see for myself that you weren\u2019t in too much of a bad way. And if you really are too thick to work out why, though it should be bloody obvious: you\u2019re a mate, and friends do things like that for each other.\u201d\nHe stands and walks to the door, making clear that James doesn\u2019t have to respond. \u201cBe back with breakfast for you before I go. An\u2019 make sure you keep your phone close at hand so you can call me if you need anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute, Robbie?\u201d\nRobbie pauses on his way to his office, following Innocent to hers instead. \u201cOf course, ma\u2019am.\u201d \n\u201cHow is James? On the mend, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cStill on crutches and in a cast. He\u2019ll have a check-up in a week or so, but it\u2019ll be a while yet before he\u2019s into a walking boot, from what I understand. It\u2019ll be desk duties for him for at least a month once he\u2019s back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019ll love that.\u201d Innocent\u2019s tone is as dry as he\u2019s ever heard it. \u201cHow is he otherwise?\u201d\n\u201cTired today. The journey back wasn\u2019t easy on him. But don\u2019t be surprised if he comes into work tomorrow. To quote him, there\u2019s nothing wrong with my brain.\u201d\nInnocent sighs. \u201cOn safety grounds alone, I should veto that. What he might do in the privacy of his own home is up to him, but if he has an accident here, or overdoes things before he\u2019s cleared by a doctor, then we are liable. It isn\u2019t just his leg in a cast, after all, is it? Broken ribs as well.\u201d\nRobbie pulls a face. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d prefer to have him where I can keep an eye on him. I\u2019ll take full responsibility, ma\u2019am. And anyway,\u201d he adds, \u201cas long as he stays at his desk it won\u2019t be a problem. He\u2019s over the concussion and the bruising\u2019s starting to fade, and he\u2019s coping well with the rest.\u201d\nInnocent makes a note on the pad in front of her. \u201cMake sure he sees the station medic as soon as he comes in tomorrow. Or \u2014 I assume you\u2019re driving him for now?\u201d Robbie nods. \u201cTake him straight there when you get in. And make clear that if the doctor has any hesitation, he\u2019s not staying. And, of course, nothing beyond desk duties until he passes the fitness exam.\u201d\nRobbie nods agreement, and tries not to imagine the conversation should James not be declared fit to work. His bagman might have been exhausted enough today for even him to see that he\u2019s better off staying at home, but where James is concerned that sort of situation is rarer than Hooper solving a major crime.\nHe returns to his office, where Barnes \u2014 as relentlessly enthusiastic and talkative as before \u2014 lies in wait for him, determined to bring him up to date on events during his absence. He buys himself some time by insisting that he needs to catch up on important email first, and is then utterly delighted to discover that DI Peterson\u2019s current investigation has had a major breakthrough and he needs additional officers to assist with house-to-house and to comb through information received. It\u2019s an easy decision: he immediately replies to offer the services of Barnes and a couple of DCs, and then dispatches Barnes to round up the constables. \nBarnes and Peterson. He\u2019s going to enjoy telling James about this tonight.\n\nRobbie\u2019s working his way through the abundance of reports that have accumulated in his absence when a shadow falls across his doorway. \u201cI see you managed to persuade the Boy Wonder to stay at home.\u201d\nHe gives Laura a rueful smile. \u201cAll his decision. He woke up knackered and in pain, an\u2019 just didn\u2019t have the energy to move.\u201d\nShe strolls into the office to lean against the filing cabinet. \u201cHardly surprising. It won\u2019t be that easy again, though. Knowing James, he\u2019ll be trying to run before he can walk \u2014 literally.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Robbie sighs, then stands. \u201cCan I inveigle you out for lunch?\u201d\n\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Laura falls into step with him as they make their way out of the nick to walk to a cafe they\u2019re both fond of. \u201cI was hoping to talk to you alone,\u201d she says once they\u2019re away from the station premises. \u201cIf I know James, he\u2019s not going to want to feel that he\u2019s being fussed over. But you don\u2019t recover from a broken leg as easily as a sprained ankle, and that\u2019s without even considering his ribs.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Robbie nods. \u201cI\u2019ve already told him he needs to see a doctor here, find out what follow-up treatment he needs. He\u2019s all on board with continuing the exercises his physio gave him, but there\u2019s got to be more than that.\u201d\nLaura nods. \u201cHe\u2019ll need to take his discharge documents to his GP, who\u2019ll refer him to a fracture clinic for follow-up. He\u2019ll need check-ups and physiotherapy every few weeks until the cast comes off. And then after that\u2014\u201d She pulls a face.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Robbie\u2019s got a sinking feeling.\n\u201cWell, a lot of people assume that once the cast comes off their troubles are over and everything\u2019s back to normal, but it\u2019s not. Even if they\u2019ve been doing the physiotherapy and keeping their muscles active, the leg\u2019s still going to be weak, and walking on it\u2019ll be painful for some time. Walking normally isn\u2019t easy, and if he\u2019s not careful he could end up with a permanent limp if he favours that leg too much. He\u2019ll need a lot of support and nagging to do what he needs to do. And the physio intensifies once the cast\u2019s gone \u2014 and he\u2019ll need someone to help him with the exercises at home as well.\u201d She glances at Robbie. \u201cI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s no-one else to do that?\u201d\nRobbie shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t mind helping, though I dunno how he\u2019ll feel about his boss bullying him through that sort of stuff.\u201d\nLaura nods again. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt. Though I suppose James is used to forcing himself through pain \u2014 he was a rower, after all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s got motivation. He wants to be able to pass the fitness exam. Innocent won\u2019t let him near active duty until he does.\u201d\n\u201cMmm. Still, it won\u2019t be easy for either of you. It\u2019ll take a lot of patience, and probably a lot of arguments. If I know James, he\u2019s going to hate the fact that he needs help. That young man is far too stubborn for his own good.\u201d She grins suddenly. \u201cRather like someone else I could mention.\u201d\n\u201cOi.\u201d Robbie nudges her with his elbow. \u201cAny more o\u2019 that and you\u2019ll be buying your own lunch.\u201d\nHer smile\u2019s the ultimate in mischievous. \u201cYou\u2019re such a gentleman, Robbie Lewis. I\u2019ll have the smoked salmon ciabatta.\u201d\nChuckling, he leaves her to get a table while he places their order.\n\nThe first thing Robbie notices when he opens his front door that evening is the delicious smell of cooking food. It\u2019s all he can do not to march in and tear several strips off James. The bloke should be resting and avoiding putting pressure on his cast, not to mention the risks he\u2019s taken working in the kitchen alone. What if he\u2019d fallen? \n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you went out to Sainsbury\u2019s!\u201d There are indeed Sainsbury\u2019s bags on the kitchen counter, and dishes stacked by the sink waiting to be washed. \nJames, wearing loose tracksuit bottoms and balancing on just one crutch so that he has his other arm free, pauses in the act of wiping down the countertop. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t. I could have got there by taxi, but I didn\u2019t fancy the prospect of being run into by the army of OAPs who shop there on Tuesday afternoons.\u201d He gestures to his phone, lying next to the plastic bags. \u201cThere\u2019s an app, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAn app?\u201d Bloody hell, how is it that James invariably makes him feel like an idiot in just a few words?\n\u201cFor ordering online. Naturally, I\u2019d prefer to choose fresh fruit and veg in person, but in the circumstances...\u201d James shrugs. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do too bad a job. Hope you like shepherd\u2019s pie, sir?\u201d\nRobbie sighs, deciding to give up chastising his sergeant as a bad job. James clearly hasn\u2019t come to any harm in the kitchen, and it spares them both yet another takeaway order. Besides, if he\u2019s honest, he\u2019d hate being inactive every bit as much.\nThe pie is excellent. Robbie informs James that, so long as he doesn\u2019t injure himself, he\u2019s in charge of cooking as long as he stays at the flat. Conversation over dinner\u2019s nice, too; James is highly amused at Barnes being loaned to Peterson. \u201cHope they become inseparable,\u201d he comments dryly. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting my governor.\u201d\nRobbie raises an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s your decision, sergeant. Mind,\u201d he adds with a grin, \u201cI\u2019m okay with the bagman I\u2019ve got. Mostly. At least you\u2019re not far too cheerful first thing in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI shall endeavour forthwith and hereafter to match, if not exceed, you in grumpiness each morning, sir.\u201d James smirks.\nAfter dinner\u2019s nice, too, relaxing on the couch with a bottle of Bridge each as they watch Channel Four news. James says he hasn\u2019t needed painkillers today, though Robbie privately thinks he should still be taking them. But, as the programme ends, Robbie knows he has to bring up the stuff James won\u2019t want to talk about. \u201cSo, Innocent says you can return to work tomorrow as long as you see the station medic as soon as you get in.\u201d\n\u201cWaste of time, but whatever.\u201d James\u2019s expression makes clear that he believes Robbie agrees with him.\n\u201cThere are liability issues,\u201d Robbie points out. \u201cI do see her point.\u201d James huffs. \u201cBut that\u2019s not all. You need to see your GP, don\u2019t you? For a referral to the fracture clinic? You make an appointment in the morning, and I\u2019ll drive you if I\u2019m free.\u201d\nJames\u2019s hands curl into fists. He makes a sound that could be agreement, but could equally be Sod off. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he enquires, an undertone to his voice that Robbie recognises only too well and that hints strongly that the answer better be no.\nRobbie shrugs casually. \u201cDo your exercises today? Thought you might like help, if not.\u201d\nJames is silent for \u2014 Robbie counts \u2014 almost twenty seconds. Then he twists his body abruptly to reach for his crutches. \u201cIf it\u2019ll stop you nagging, sir, I will be delighted to accept your assistance.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour or so later, the air is blue with curses. It\u2019s been painful for James, but also frustrating because he wants to do more than he\u2019s capable of, and Robbie\u2019s having to be forceful in preventing him. A few loops up and down the hallway on the crutches isn\u2019t too bad; James is used to this now, though he wants to do more than the Czech physio recommended. Getting up and down from a seated position is painful, and as he watches Robbie chastises himself for leaving before James was out of bed this morning. Leg raises while sitting are the worst, and that\u2019s when James really does start cursing.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell me to try harder, sir. You have no fucking idea how hard I\u2019m sodding already trying. Fucking bastardleg...\u201d\nThis goes on for several minutes, with each sir louder and more vehement, and Robbie has to turn his face aside so James can\u2019t see his expression. Not that he\u2019s angry \u2014 far from it. It\u2019s actually too bloody funny to see his normally respectful and proper sergeant letting loose like this. He\u2019s even tempted to comment on the lack of variety in James\u2019s vocabulary. It wouldn\u2019t be kind, considering what the bloke\u2019s going through, and certainly wouldn\u2019t be well-received.\nOnce he has his expression under control, he gives James a sardonic look. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep cursing at me, call me Robbie. Bad enough you callin\u2019 me sir when you\u2019re being mean, as it is.\u201d He smirks, making sure that James sees it and knows he\u2019s pulling the lad\u2019s leg.\nJames huffs. \u201cRobbie. This fucking hurts and it\u2019s going to fucking hurt regardless of what I call you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it won\u2019t, \u2018cause you\u2019ve done enough for one day.\u201d Robbie supports James\u2019s cast as he lowers his leg to the floor. \u201cCuppa?\u201d\nJames grunts something, which Robbie takes as assent, and he heads to the kitchen. Better to leave the lad in peace for a bit, give him privacy to recover his composure. When he returns close to ten minutes later with two mugs of tea, he also puts James\u2019s painkillers on the end table alongside the bloke\u2019s mug, all within easy reach, and clicks the remote to turn the telly back on. There\u2019s an episode of QI, which removes the need to talk, so James doesn\u2019t need to pretend to be sociable. Just as well for him if he doesn\u2019t; Robbie can see the purplish shadows under his eyes and the exhaustion he\u2019s trying to hide along with the pain. Pain not just from his leg, of course; those exercises had to have been rough on his still-healing ribs as well. It\u2019s noticeable, too, that James doesn\u2019t even try to engage with the programme by answering questions and criticising the contestants; he\u2019s simply slumped back against the cushions, eyes half-lidded as he pretends to watch.\nOnce the closing credits roll, Robbie nudges him gently. \u201cOff to bed with you.\u201d\nJames doesn\u2019t even attempt to put up an argument. He shifts forward awkwardly and tries to reach for his crutches, so Robbie forestalls him and picks them up, then without fuss takes James\u2019s arm to balance him as he gets up. He gets a weary-sounding \u201cThanks\u201d as James then swings out of the living-room and on his way to bed.\nA little later, once he\u2019s heard James get into bed, he taps lightly on the door. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d\n\u201cWould you please come in, sir?\u201d James calls in return. \nWhen he enters, the lad\u2019s lying in bed looking distinctly uncomfortable, one arm feeling around far underneath the covers for something. Robbie frowns in concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d James shakes his head, clearly putting on an act of nonchalance. \u201cJust a bit of leg-cramp. It\u2019ll go away. I wanted to apologise, sir\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhich leg?\u201d Robbie advances to the bed. \u201cUsed to be a dab hand helping Val with cramps when she was pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cThe right one. Calf.\u201d Now James just sounds miserable. And, of course, it won\u2019t be just the cramping that\u2019s causing the misery. Any jolt to that leg is probably making his other leg jerk and shift, which will be bloody painful.\nJames brings his hand back out from under the covers and slumps back against the pillow. Robbie\u2019s about to take that as implied permission to intervene, but stops himself just in time. James isn\u2019t Val. He\u2019s not only an adult male who\u2019s normally a very private person and someone who hates fuss, but he\u2019s also Robbie\u2019s subordinate. Yes, Robbie\u2019s been helping him already, including with getting dressed when they were travelling, but this is a bit more intimate still. Possibly inappropriate even with explicit permission, and definitely so without.\n\u201cWould you like me to...?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind, sir \u2014 please.\u201d\nRobbie jabs his thumb into his chest. \u201cRobbie. Sir at work.\u201d James frowns at this; whether he\u2019s got some sort of idiotic notion about it being disrespectful, or whether he really feels more comfortable with the formality \u2014 especially living in his boss\u2019s home \u2014 Robbie can\u2019t tell. \u201cLook, you\u2019re gonna be living here for at least a month, probably more. Don\u2019t fancy being sirred nigh-on twenty-four hours a day.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d James shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t inconvenience you for that long. Once I\u2019m more used to getting around, I can go home.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft.\u201d Robbie perches on the side of the bed. \u201cThink I wouldn\u2019t be worryin\u2019 about you if you were home on your own with those things?\u201d He nods at the crutches. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here where I can keep an eye on you an\u2019 be certain you\u2019re all right. Now, mind if I pull back the covers?\u201d\nOnce he\u2019s pulled the duvet back far enough, Robbie\u2019s careful to avoid looking at anything other than the stretch of calf that James indicates is causing him pain. The least he can do is preserve the lad\u2019s dignity \u2014 and that includes not looking at James\u2019s face. This isn\u2019t all that different from sorting out Val\u2019s cramps, except that she wasn\u2019t wearing a ruddy great plaster cast. \u201cThis helping?\u201d he asks after he\u2019s built up a rhythm, keeping his movements careful to avoid jolting James\u2019s left leg.\n\u201cYes. Sir. Robbie.\u201d Now the lad\u2019s sounding awkward again. What now? He grunts in assent. \u201cI was unbelievably rude and ungrateful earlier. I should never have spoken to you like that, especially not shouting. I am very sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Robbie cuts across him, keeping his tone completely matter-of-fact. \u201cReckon I\u2019d be yelling and cursing as well if I was in as much pain an\u2019 being forced to do things that make it worse. Bloody torture, those exercises.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The emotion behind that single word is heartfelt. \u201cAnd going to get worse, probably,\u201d James adds. \u201cFracture clinic \u2014 that\u2019s going to mean more physio, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAye. An\u2019 Laura said it\u2019ll most likely be tougher still for you when the cast comes off.\u201d Robbie continues rubbing and kneading, though he can feel the stiff muscle beginning to yield. And this really isn\u2019t like sorting out Val\u2019s cramping. James\u2019s leg is long and lean, the muscle solid beneath smooth skin. This is the body of an athlete, and Robbie can\u2019t help imagining the bloke in one of those rowing-boats, thighs and calves rippling as he moves smoothly back and forth, pulling and withdrawing the oars in perfect timing with the rest of the crew...\nA resigned huff comes from behind Robbie, interrupting his thoughts. \u201cRemind me never to break my leg again.\u201d\nRobbie lets out a bark of laughter. \u201cBest stay away from taxis in foreign countries, then, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair, it wasn\u2019t the taxi-driver\u2019s fault.\u201d Robbie feels James shifting slightly behind him. \u201cThank you, s\u2014 Robbie. That feels much better.\u201d \n\u201cCramp gone?\u201d He glances around at James. \n\u201cMmm.\u201d James is looking more relaxed \u2014 but, abruptly, he winces. \u201cDamn. Bloody cast. Itching,\u201d he adds, as Robbie gives him a questioning look.\n\u201cCan\u2019t help with that, sorry.\u201d He gives James\u2019s thigh a consoling pat, then realises what he\u2019s done and winces internally. Bloody hell, what was he thinking? He withdraws his hand and pulls up the covers, then stands. \u201cLeave you to sleep, unless there\u2019s anything else you need?\u201d\nJames shakes his head, then abruptly yawns. Robbie\u2019s about to turn and leave, but feels his hand grasped in a warm clasp. He raises an eyebrow in enquiry. \u201cThank you, so very much.\u201d James\u2019s tone is sincere and emphatic. Then his lips curve up very faintly. \u201cI\u2019m going to owe you a lifetime of pints once I\u2019m back on my feet, I think.\u201d \nRobbie grins. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that, man.\u201d He returns James\u2019s grip briefly, then frees his hand. \u201cSleep well.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight, Robbie.\u201d\nAs he leaves, heading to his own bedroom, the sensation of warmth around his hand lingers \u2014 comforting, reassuring, yet oddly unsettling.\n\nIt\u2019s a relief to have James back in his rightful place sitting across from Robbie, where he can see the lad any time he glances past his computer monitor. It feels as if a fundamental misalignment has abruptly, and happily, snapped back into proper place. All\u2019s right with Robbie\u2019s little corner of the universe \u2014 well, mostly. There\u2019s still the small matter of the plaster cast that\u2019s occasionally visible below the cuff of the loose tracksuit bottoms James will be wearing for the foreseeable future, and the aluminium crutches leaning against the bloke\u2019s desk.\nAnd, of course, James isn\u2019t fully back to his usual job \u2014 he\u2019s confined to desk duties for probably a couple of months yet. Right now, that\u2019s fine; Robbie\u2019s not yet back on the rotation anyway, and he\u2019s still catching up on all those reports, but now with James making light work of a good chunk of them. Conversation in the office is also back to normal: no more over-enthusiastic cheerfulness. Instead, the rhythmic tapping of keyboards is punctuated by a combination of sardonic commentary on the documents and statements James is reading, and literary quotes and allusions. Who\u2019d have thought Robbie\u2019d ever admit \u2014 even to himself \u2014 that he\u2019s missed being assaulted with bloody Shakespeare? But he has.\nThe only downsides are that he\u2019s had to become the designated teaboy, since James can hardly be expected to procure drinks. And that the world and his wife seem to have found reasons to drop into their office over the course of the morning, asking how James is. \u201cThey just want to see the evidence for themselves,\u201d James comments dryly after yet another incursion.\nNot long after noon, Laura pops in, and she\u2019s carrying a paper carrier bag from a sandwich caf\u00e9 the three of them sometimes frequent. \u201cThought getting out for lunch might be a bit of a challenge,\u201d she announces cheerfully. \u201cHow are you, James? It\u2019s good to see you back.\u201d\nJames leans back carefully in his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely good to be back, though I believe I would have preferred to have returned without the extra luggage.\u201d He gestures to his cast.\n\u201cWell, if you will go gallivanting off to foreign parts...\u201d Laura gives him a mischievous wink as she starts to unpack the bag. Roast beef on ciabatta for James, with what looks like his favourite fancy coffee, and some kind of pastry, and a ham and cheese focaccia for Robbie, with an ordinary white coffee and millionaire\u2019s shortbread. \u201cDon\u2019t imagine you\u2019re going to get delivery service every day, James. This is just to welcome you back.\u201d\nJames looks genuinely touched. \u201cThank you, Doctor. Rest assured I don\u2019t take your kindness for granted at all.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it. And, James,\u201d she adds, perching lightly on the side of James\u2019s desk, \u201cI took the liberty of talking to a colleague who is a doctor in the fracture clinic at the JR. She says that if you like you can send her your discharge paperwork from the hospital in Prague and she can get you an appointment. Save you waiting to see your GP to get a referral.\u201d\nRobbie\u2019s ready to intervene, given James\u2019s reaction last night when he was reminded about the need to get follow-up care organised, but the lad gives Laura a lopsided, appreciative smile. \u201cThank you, Dr Hobson. That\u2019s really helpful. If you give me her contact information, I\u2019ll do that straight away.\u201d He grimaces, making his face look longer than usual. \u201cNot that I am particularly looking forward to further torture, but if it\u2019s going to help ensure that I don\u2019t end up with any long-term damage from this...\u201d He shrugs, an expression of resigned tolerance.\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Laura smiles in sympathy. \u201cHow\u2019s the nicotine withdrawal?\u201d\nJames pulls a face. Robbie meets his gaze to give him an understanding twist of his lips. It has been rough on the lad. Several times a day, he\u2019s noticed James patting his pockets before obviously realising that he doesn\u2019t have any cigarettes, and anyway that he isn\u2019t supposed to be smoking. He bets, too, that James has no idea how often he does it. \n\u201cHere.\u201d Laura reaches into her handbag and pulls out a large bag of what look like mints. \u201cThey\u2019re sugar-free, so you won\u2019t put on weight. When I gave up smoking \u2014 oh, yeah, I used to smoke,\u201d she says on clearly feeling both their incredulous gazes on her. \u201cOccupational hazard when you\u2019re a junior doctor. All those long, long shifts \u2014 longer than now \u2014 and the stress and everything else. And most of the nurses smoked, too. If you didn\u2019t actually take up smoking, you\u2019d be almost as badly off thanks to the passive smoking. Anyway, having something to suck helped.\u201d She rolls her eyes as James starts to smirk. \u201cNo smart-alec comments from you, Hathaway.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it, Doctor.\u201d James reaches for the mints. \u201cThank you again.\u201d\nLaura pats James\u2019s forearm and stands. \u201cLook after him, Robbie. We want him back in one piece as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cI do, too.\u201d Robbie grins, waving in the direction of James\u2019s left leg. \u201cSooner he\u2019s back to being the one keeping me supplied with coffee, the better, far as I\u2019m concerned!\u201d\n\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cBig day today, eh?\u201d Robbie grins at James over the breakfast table.\nJames sets his coffee down and heaves a long sigh. \u201cI won\u2019t be sorry to lose those.\u201d He nods towards the crutches.\n\u201cJust hope you remember what to do with your left leg, after not using it for so long,\u201d Robbie comments, lips twitching. \n\u201cCan\u2019t use it to trip suspects up yet.\u201d James\u2019s expression is suspiciously deadpan. \u201cCould practice on you, though. Just to make sure I haven\u2019t lost my technique.\u201d\n\u201cOi. Just for that, I should leave you to Hooper\u2019s mercies to get to your appointment.\u201d Robbie stands, tilting his head towards the door. \u201cTime we got a wriggle on. Give those things their last airing.\u201d\nJames reaches for the things in question, giving them a look of disgust as he does so. \u201cWonder how much I\u2019d get if I sold them for scrap metal?\u201d\nRobbie snorts. \u201cCome on. Car, you.\u201d\nHe holds open the passenger door and stands ready to help in the unlikely event that James might need assistance. But the lad\u2019s a dab hand at manoeuvring himself in and out of the car by now. Not surprising; it\u2019s been more than four weeks since they got back from Prague, after all.\nFour weeks of ups and downs, of alternately supporting and coercing James through his daily exercises, doing his best to keep the lad\u2019s spirits up and, at work, find ways to prevent him feeling useless and frustrated at being stuck behind a desk while Robbie\u2019s been out and about investigating the crimes assigned to his team. \nJames, being James, has alternated between going hell for leather at his exercises, pushing himself too hard with the thigh-stretching and knee-bending he\u2019s had to do, and then \u2014 because he pushed himself too hard the day before and he\u2019s in pain \u2014 complaining and swearing when Robbie\u2019d reminded him to get started. And, because he wouldn\u2019t be James if he just left it at the recommended exercises, he\u2019s also been working on maintaining his upper body strength, at least so far as his healing ribs will allow him. As he\u2019s reminded Robbie on more than one occasion, he\u2019s not smoking as well as not going for his daily runs and other regular activities, and he has no wish to put on weight.\nAs a result, there\u2019ve been more cramps and aching muscles along the way, and after the second time Robbie had just gone to Boots and got a heating pad, ibuprofen gel and some lotion the pharmacy assistant had assured him would work well for massaging when necessary. It\u2019s not just been James\u2019s right calf giving him trouble. What with all the stretching, his left thigh\u2019s needed attention too.\nAnd so Robbie\u2019s found himself in James\u2019s bedroom at least twice a week, applying lotion and rubbing and kneading up and down aching muscles. It\u2019s helped, so the looks of grateful appreciation James has given him each time have said. And he\u2019d discovered, when he\u2019d accompanied James on his first visit to the fracture clinic, that the massages help with healing the scar tissue. Didn\u2019t make much sense to Robbie, given the broken bone is in the lower portion of James\u2019s leg, but the doctor\u2019d assured him it was true.\nIt\u2019s been a lot of work, as James has pointed out more times than Robbie feels is necessary \u2014 but it\u2019s not been a chore, not by any means. It\u2019s been good to have someone around the flat for more than the occasional evening. To have company across the table over breakfast, even if neither of them\u2019s much given to chatting at that hour of the morning. To have sounds around the place other than the clanking of central heating switching on and off, and the neighbours moving around. \nCompany in the evenings, as well, the two of them slouching on the sofa together, bickering casually over what to watch on the telly and whether to have coffee or beer. James gradually slumping sideways and ending up leaning against Robbie as post-exercise weariness sets in \u2014 once or twice, to the point of resting his head against Robbie\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019s not sure whether James was even aware of what he\u2019d done. And what\u2019s odd, thinking about it, is that under different circumstances he knows he\u2019d take the serious piss out of James the next day for doing something like that \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t. \nBecause, he realises, he hasn\u2019t minded one bit. \nEven more disconcertingly, he\u2019s had to stop himself on several occasions from looping his arm around James\u2019s shoulders to pull the bloke in closer. It\u2019d make him more comfortable, he\u2019s told himself. But the uncomfortable realisation that he\u2019d actually be cuddling his sergeant, a man who reports to him, has stopped him hard in his tracks every time. And he\u2019s only too aware that it\u2019s strange for that to be the main reason, and not because James is a man, or that he\u2019s still grieving enough for Val to have pulled back from the possibility of a deeper relationship with Laura.\nThe flat\u2019s going to feel very empty when James is finally recovered enough to go home. \nNot yet, though. Today\u2019s just the exchanging of crutches and the current cast for a walking cast. It\u2019s been made very clear by the doctor at the fracture clinic that this is not permission to behave as if James has no restrictions on his movements. A walking cast means he can put his foot to the ground and he can walk on the leg \u2014 but with support. Initially, either a Zimmer frame or a stabilising cane \u2014 and Robbie still wants to laugh at the sour expression on his sergeant\u2019s face when that was mentioned \u2014 and then once he\u2019s steadier on his feet a standard cane will do. He\u2019ll still be advised to limit the amount of walking he does, and especially on uneven surfaces or stairs, beyond a small amount of practice on steps to build up strength. And he\u2019s advised not to be alone, in case of falls or other accidents, and especially for supervision when exercising.\nThe appointment\u2019s not until late morning, so they\u2019re heading into the station first. Robbie has a suspect to interview, a habitual criminal who\u2019s been cooling his heels in a cell overnight and is therefore going to be frustrated enough to be less careful than he might otherwise be. He glances at James as they wait at red traffic lights. \u201cWant to interview Gregg with me?\u201d\nThere\u2019s the faintest movement of James\u2019s eyes and lips, but to Robbie, who\u2019s had six years to study and understand his awkward sod of a sergeant, it\u2019s the equivalent of a blazing smile. \u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been frustrating for James at work as well. Robbie\u2019s tried to involve him in active investigations as much as possible, and not only for James\u2019s benefit; there\u2019s no-one on his team better at research, or at very politely but persistently obtaining information over the telephone from people who cite supposedly-ethical reasons for failing to provide details to the police: lawyers, journalists, phone companies, assorted bigwigs and so on. It\u2019s still not the same as being out and about, and Robbie is well aware, though James hasn\u2019t said anything, that the bloke is trying hard not to resent it any time he sees Robbie collect one of the DCs for a scene visit or to go and talk to someone involved in a case.\nThey make a bloody good team, the two of them, when they\u2019re shoulder to shoulder on a case. He hopes James knows Robbie\u2019s feelings on that subject, and that Robbie\u2019s got no intention of doing without James longer-term \u2014 unless, of course, the lad decided to look to his own career. Which he should be doing, but has made clear he has no interest in that at the moment. \nJames pulls a face abruptly. \u201cI\u2019m not really dressed for interviewing.\u201d He tugs at the stretch-cotton fabric of the track bottoms he\u2019s wearing, one of three pairs he\u2019s been rotating. \n\u201cDoubt Gregg\u2019ll care. Besides, I think the long bits of metal you\u2019re carrying around will be a bit more noticeable than what you\u2019re wearing on your legs.\u201d\nJames grunts. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019m looking forward to getting back into trousers.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet you won\u2019t. They still won\u2019t fit over your cast.\u201d \nA scowl \u2014 and then James\u2019s face brightens. \u201cThere\u2019s a place not far from the nick that does alterations. I could take a couple of pairs in and have the seams unpicked.\u201d\n\u201cYou could, if you really want to.\u201d Robbie turns into the station car park. \u201cPub meal and a couple of pints tonight to celebrate your freedom from aluminium and hopping on one leg?\u201d\nBy the look on the bloke\u2019s face, Robbie could have offered to fulfil his wildest dream. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t driving, I\u2019d kiss you.\u201d\n\u201cOi.\u201d Robbie casts a frown in James\u2019s direction. \u201cSave your kisses for someone you\u2019d actually enjoy kissing.\u201d Something\u2019s fluttering in his chest as he steers the car into his space. Better not be bloody indigestion.\n\n\u201cJust kill me now. Please.\u201d James sinks into a captain\u2019s chair inside the Vicky Arms and closes his eyes in sheer relief. The stabilising cane he was given at the hospital earlier starts to slide, and Robbie catches it before it clatters to the floor.\nThe first couple of hours wearing the walking cast had gone pretty well for James. He\u2019d had to practice first before leaving the clinic, which had involved walking up and down a long corridor, and then climbing and descending a small set of steps several times over. He\u2019d insisted at first that everything was fine, that of course getting back to putting weight on his left leg took some getting used to and that in a couple of days he was sure he\u2019d be walking smoothly.\nAround late afternoon, Robbie\u2019d caught sight of the first wince of pain. James had offered to go and collect some results from the tech team, and he\u2019d been limping badly by the time he came back. \u201cLeg\u2019s tired,\u201d he\u2019d said, his tone casually dismissive, but Robbie knows better.\n\u201cTake a painkiller?\u201d he suggests now, but James is shaking his head, without opening his eyes.\n\u201cYou promised me a pint. Two pints, in fact. Nothing\u2019s going to stop me enjoying those. Anyway, the alcohol will numb the pain.\u201d\nRobbie keeps his counsel. If he was in the lad\u2019s place, he\u2019d probably feel the same way. After that first evening when they\u2019d had beer with dinner, James hasn\u2019t had a single drink; painkillers aside, his doctor had recommended against it. \nBut something about the way James is shifting in his chair makes him frown abruptly. \u201cNot just your leg, is it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a moment before James reacts, and at first he just pulls a face. \u201cBack. Lower back on the other side.\u201d\nAh \u2014 yes, the doctor\u2019d warned that could happen. Robbie nods. \u201cWant me to rub some gel on it when we get home?\u201d\nJames takes a long gulp of his pint, then meets Robbie\u2019s gaze, something that looks like longing in his eyes. What, the pain\u2019s that bad? \u201cPlease.\u201d He pulls a face then. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not as bad as the pain in the first few weeks. It\u2019s just that...\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinkin\u2019 once you\u2019d got to this stage you\u2019d be on the mend?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d James traces a squiggle in the condensation his glass has left on the table. \u201cAnd getting out from under your feet so you can have your flat \u2014 and your life \u2014 to yourself again.\u201d\nIt\u2019s daft. He\u2019s known all along that James will be going home as soon as he\u2019s fit to cope alone again. But right at this moment it hits Robbie like a thunderclap: James will be leaving soon. Leaving his flat empty of anyone but Robbie himself, taking his smartarse comments and cleverclogs monologues and health-conscious lectures with him. \nAnd Robbie doesn\u2019t bloody want him to go.\n\n\u201cAhhhh...\u201d\nJames\u2019s moan sounds as if it\u2019s torn out of him, and it goes straight to Robbie\u2019s gut. Christ. Could this be any more inappropriate? Any more wrong, and against just about every rule that exists for senior officers and their subordinates?\nJames is lying on top of his bed, naked except for a pair of skin-tight briefs that look like they\u2019re made of something like silk, and of course his cast. He\u2019s all lean and hard muscle beneath pale, unblemished skin, and Robbie can\u2019t help thinking of that exhibition of Ancient Greek Olympian paintings and sculptures Morse had insisted on going to while they were in Verona. James belongs somewhere like that.\nHe\u2019s beautiful, and Robbie has no right thinking of him like that. And especially not as his hands knead and press over James\u2019s lower back to the right of his spine, almost but not quite to the curve of his backside.\n\u201cThat enough?\u201d he asks, more gruffly than intended, but better that than James hears what\u2019s really in his head.\nInstantly, James turns his head to smile in gratitude, and that smile makes something inside Robbie\u2019s chest ache. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thank you. Really, thank you, Robbie.\u201d \nAnd Robbie knows damned well that the lad would\u2019ve been glad of another ten minutes or so of the welcome massage, but he doesn\u2019t dare offer. \nWhat the fuck\u2019s wrong with him? Lusting after a man \u2014 a man \u2014 who\u2019s not far off twenty-five years his junior, and who\u2019s also his subordinate officer, duty-bound to follow his orders? Innocent would have him up on a disciplinary \u2014 Christ, he\u2019d have himself up on a disciplinary.\nIt really is time he seriously considered retiring, once and for all.\n\nThe stabilising cane disappears and is replaced by a standard walking stick after a day or two, but James\u2019s back pain lingers. And, as each evening in Robbie\u2019s flat winds towards night and they gradually make moves towards heading to bed, Robbie knows James is hoping he\u2019ll offer another backrub. He doesn\u2019t. Can\u2019t. \nHe slides his gaze away from James\u2019s, knowing the lad\u2019s wondering why he\u2019s backing away suddenly after being perfectly willing to rub the bloke\u2019s thigh several times a week up till now. And, as James limps awkwardly and clearly painfully towards Robbie\u2019s spare bedroom, Robbie curses himself for the stupid, useless sod he is.\nThe sooner James is out of the cast and declared fit to drive again, the better for both of them. Maybe then Robbie\u2019ll be able to shake off this bloody insane attraction to his sergeant and things can get back to normal \u2014 before James realises what\u2019s up with his boss and asks Innocent for a transfer.\nJames picks at his breakfast the following morning, and barely speaks beyond a \u201cYes, sir,\u201d when asked if he slept well. It\u2019s that sir that provokes Robbie to abandon his initial decision to ignore his sergeant\u2019s mood. \n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d\nJames taps his fingers against the tabletop for a moment or two, then his lips tug downwards at the sides. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I moved back home, sir. Yes, I know I can\u2019t drive yet, but I can get a uniform to drive me in and out. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Robbie\u2019s struggling to speak; his stomach feels like it\u2019s been kicked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that I\u2019ve outstayed my welcome, sir.\u201d James is looking straight at him now. There\u2019s no accusation in his expression, only apology and embarrassment.\nAnd there\u2019s no way that Robbie can let James take the blame for this. James isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s brought their comfortable cohabitation to a point where Robbie can\u2019t let himself touch the bloke in case he betrays his reaction to it. James isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s betraying their long working relationship and friendship by having a mid-life sexuality crisis. And James isn\u2019t the one who can\u2019t bloody control himself enough to hide it.\nYes, it\u2019d probably be for the best if James did go home. But best for whom? Not for James, who really shouldn\u2019t be trying to cope on his own yet \u2014 and that\u2019s not just Robbie\u2019s opinion, but that of James\u2019s doctor at the fracture clinic. It\u2019s not just about James\u2019s physical well-being, either. That look on his face is taking Robbie back to the hospital in Prague, where James simply hadn\u2019t believed that Robbie\u2019d come all that way just for him.\nHas he ever had anyone care enough about him to put his well-being \u2014 physical and emotional \u2014 before their own?\nIf he lets James leave now, then no matter what he says James will never believe that he hadn\u2019t come to be a nuisance, that Robbie wants rid of him.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve not.\u201d Robbie says it as firmly, as convincingly, as he can. He wants James to know that he\u2019s completely genuine about this, regardless of whatever else he\u2019s not prepared to discuss. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice havin\u2019 you here. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you can stay as long as you want.\u201d\nHis assurance is greeted with confusion. \u201cBut the last couple of evenings you\u2019ve seemed...\u201d James shakes his head. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been putting a lot of demands on you, but up until a few days ago you didn\u2019t seem to mind. I understand, though. It can\u2019t be easy having someone else in your home for this kind of prolonged period, especially when you\u2019re having to put yourself out to help me all the time.\u201d\nRobbie shakes his head quickly, emphatically. He\u2019s really mucked this up, and there\u2019s no way he can pretend he doesn\u2019t know this is about his refusal to help James with his back pain. \u201cIt\u2019s not putting meself out to help you, man. Thought you\u2019d know that by now.\u201d He stands and takes their plates away, since neither of them appears to have any further interest in breakfast. \u201cLook, if this is about me not sortin\u2019 out your muscle pain any more, it\u2019s... well, it started to feel... inappropriate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Disbelief pours from James\u2019s voice.\n\u201cCome on, man! I\u2019m your boss, an\u2019 there you are lyin\u2019 almost starkers on the bed with me rubbing...\u201d Robbie shakes his head, glad he\u2019s got his back to James as he stacks the dishes by the sink.\nHe just about hears the faint sigh from James. \u201cOf course, if it makes you uncomfortable, sir...\u201d\nWith the clear indication that it doesn\u2019t make James uncomfortable at all. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can imagine what Innocent would say,\u201d he points out. \n\u201cNone of her business, is it?\u201d There\u2019s the sound of a chair being pushed back as James stands. \u201cLook, of course I\u2019ll manage the back pain on my own. I\u2019d never want to put you in any situation where you\u2019re uncomfortable. But I did think you\u2019d made clear that you didn\u2019t want me to think of you as my boss while I\u2019m here. To me, that means you shouldn\u2019t be thinking of me as your subordinate.\u201d\nOf course the lad\u2019s right. Not that it makes any difference, since he hasn\u2019t actually told James the full truth about his problem with the massages. Which means there really is only one way out of this.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, cleverclogs.\u201d Robbie comes over and leans his palms against the back of his chair. \u201cWhich means, yeah, I should be thinkin\u2019 of what\u2019s appropriate for a friend. And that you shouldn\u2019t be calling me sir or thinking you have to leave before you\u2019re ready.\u201d He straightens and reaches for his jacket, hanging on the back of one of the other chairs. \u201cTime we were headin\u2019 to work.\u201d\nJames follows behind him like the perfect sergeant he \u2014 almost always \u2014 is, and it\u2019s a relief to Robbie that, as he turns to lock the door, he catches sight of a faint smirk on the smartarse\u2019s face.\n\nRobbie\u2019s out of the office most of the day, following up on interviewees flagged by the DCs as worth a second look in their latest murder investigation. He\u2019s taken one of the DCs with him, a constable James has been talking up as ready for her sergeant\u2019s exams. She isn\u2019t James, of course, or anywhere close to his skills, but she\u2019s keen and catches on quickly. James might be right about her readiness.\nThe case isn\u2019t going anywhere very fast. All the interviews so far have led nowhere; no-one is certain about what they told the uniformed officers who did the original house-to-house they\u2019d seen. No-one knows anyone who might have had a grudge against the victim, who\u2019d been found with a knife in his chest two days ago, every door in his house open and every handle wiped clean. The victim himself leaves Robbie scratching his head: who\u2019d want to kill a retired Chiltern Railways ticket collector who, since his retirement, had done nothing more exciting than poke around in his garden and grow carrots and runner-beans? No family in the picture, other than a sibling in the United States who hasn\u2019t set foot in the UK in more than twenty years and who\u2019s as baffled as Robbie as to who\u2019d want to kill her brother.\nRobbie\u2019s about to suggest to DC Kent that they take a break and get a coffee at a cafe five minutes\u2019 drive from here when, abruptly, his phone rings. It\u2019s James, and he sounds \u2014 for him \u2014 excited. \u201cCan you come back to the station now, sir? I have something I think might interest you.\u201d\nFifteen minutes later, Robbie\u2019s looking over James\u2019s shoulder at their victim\u2019s email inbox \u2014 a gmail account that James has been able to obtain the password for \u2014 and reading a correspondence thread in which the dead man, Malcolm Thorndale, and someone using the nickname CollectorKing argued bitterly and aggressively about, of all things, sweet tins. \nRobbie shakes his head in bemusement. \u201cTins? What sort\u2014\u201d\nJames pulls a photograph closer. It\u2019s of a glass-fronted bookcase in Thorndale\u2019s dining-room, which is full of carefully-arranged small tins of the sort that mints and boiled sweets were sold in thirty or forty years ago or more. Double-decker buses, union jacks, royal crests, Beefeaters, phone boxes, London landscapes \u2014 all the kind of thing Robbie remembers buying in his youth. \n\u201cThose are collectibles?\u201d\n\u201cApparently so, sir. Not only are they collectible, but so much in demand that it appears CollectorKing may have been willing to kill to obtain one in \u2014 forgive me, sir \u2014 mint condition that he felt should have been his.\u201d\nAnd that, it appears, is exactly what CollectorKing did believe. He \u2014 or she \u2014 had been negotiating with a seller, but then discovered that Thorndale had swept in and bought the item outright. In the week before Thornton was murdered, the vitriol in CollectorKing\u2019s emails, in response to Thorndale\u2019s gloating, escalated to the point where CollectorKing explicitly threatened murder.\n\u201cHow do we go about identifying this CollectorKing?\u201d Robbie looks away from the computer screen to James, who is now looking extremely smug.\n\u201cAlready done, and I didn\u2019t even have to lean heavily on Google.\u201d The corners of James\u2019s mouth turn upwards. \u201cClive Ramsden uses the same nick on several collector websites, including an auction site, on which he is required to provide a full name and address for verification purposes. Using that information, I obtained photographs, vehicle and banking records, and was able to find his car on CCTV less than a quarter of a mile from Thorndale\u2019s house within an hour of the estimated time of death.\u201d James clicks on his mouse, and an enlarged photo appears of a man in the driving seat of a beige car. \u201cAll circumstantial so far, sir, but enough for a warrant to search his home and obtain DNA samples.\u201d\n\u201cMore than enough,\u201d Robbie agrees. \u201cS\u2019pose I should go and see Innocent, then.\u201d\nAnother smirk from James. \u201cAlready done. We should have the warrant imminently. Unfortunately, he lives in Swansea so, unless you particularly want a close to three-hour drive, given traffic at this time of day, I\u2019d recommend that we request assistance from South Wales Police.\u201d\n\u201cAnd let me guess.\u201d Robbie raises one eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done that too.\u201d\nJames just grins.\n\n\u201cBloody show-off, you.\u201d Robbie jabs James with his elbow as they sit nursing near-empty bottles of Bridge on the sofa. \u201cOnly you could solve a murder single-handed while confined to desk duties.\u201d\nJames shrugs. \u201cI have to safeguard my position, don\u2019t I? Can\u2019t have you deciding to replace me with DC Kent while I\u2019m not performing at my best.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Robbie snorts. \u201cCan safely say you\u2019re at no risk there. She doesn\u2019t even know how I like me coffee.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved to know my coffee-acquisition skills are part of what enables me to keep my position.\u201d James eases himself to his feet. \u201cWhich, I suppose, is a hint that you would like some coffee now?\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t say no.\u201d He follows James into the kitchen nonetheless, taking down mugs and getting milk out while James puts the kettle on and prepares the cafetiere. Robbie has hardly had a cup of instant in his flat since James moved in. On the few occasions he\u2019d had the temerity to take the jar of Nescaf\u00e9 out of the cupboard, he\u2019d been met with either a disapproving look or a pout of epic proportions. He wouldn\u2019t admit it to anyone else, but James has him well and truly trained in using the cafetiere now.\n\u201cHow\u2019s your back this evening?\u201d he asks as they bring their drinks back to the couch. He\u2019s noticed the lad\u2019s been reaching behind to rub his lower back with increasing frequency.\nHe\u2019s watching James closely, so doesn\u2019t miss the signs of an inner struggle. The lad wants to lie and say he\u2019s fine, but knows he won\u2019t get away with it. James\u2019s lips tilt downwards. \u201cAnnoying.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Robbie tilts his head towards the hallway. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got that down you, we\u2019ll go and sort you out.\u201d\n\u201cNo, really, there\u2019s no need, Robbie. I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOffered, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ll hear no more about it.\u201d He\u2019ll give the bloke the massage James needs if it kills him. He can\u2019t let the lad go to bed in that kind of pain but, even more important, he won\u2019t let James believe that Robbie can\u2019t bear to touch him.\nOnly another few days of this. Then the cast comes off and James will have full use of both his legs. That should cut down on the back pain and the need for Robbie to lay his hands on his sergeant\u2019s smooth skin and beautiful body \u2014 and, finally, stop him having these completely inappropriate thoughts about what he really wants to do to James.\nOnly another few days. It\u2019ll take a lot of willpower and determination, but he can hold out another few days.\n\n", "5": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cDunno whether that looked better before your wrapping was cut off.\u201d Robbie tilts his head in the direction of James\u2019s newly-bared left leg.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so kind.\u201d James\u2019s tone is dry, but his attention\u2019s all on his leg, thinner and even paler than the bloke\u2019s usual skin tone, as he flexes his ankle and rotates the foot.\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume you\u2018re back to normal just because the cast is off,\u201d the doctor warns then. \u201cYou\u2019ll still be in a lot of pain \u2014 remember, the bone\u2019s just healed, and your body\u2019s still coming out of compensation mode. The back pain\u2019s likely to continue for a while longer, for one thing. You will also be starting a new batch of exercises now that the leg isn\u2019t weighed down and immobilised.\u201d\nRobbie listens as the doctor runs through exercises James will be starting with the physio: leg lifts lying on the side, leg raises against resistance lying flat, more walking up and down stairs, and swimming. Does a lot to help rebuild muscle tone, swimming, apparently.\nAnd, as the two of them take all this in, Robbie\u2019s absorbing something else: his role in aiding James\u2019s recovery isn\u2019t over. James can\u2019t do all these exercises alone. He\u2019ll need supervision, especially in the swimming-pool, and someone\u2019s going to have to provide the resistance for the leg raises. Help from someone James trusts, the doctor\u2019s saying. More help than before. And the doctor\u2019s looking at Robbie, questioning, checking whether he\u2019s willing to provide that help.\nWell, of course he sodding well is! Why wouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s not just that there\u2019s no-one else. Even if there was someone, it wouldn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s Robbie\u2019s place. James is his \u2014 his sergeant, he corrects himself quickly \u2014 and that\u2019s all there is to it.\nBut. Swimming with James. In water, wearing nothing but swimming trunks. Christ. He\u2019ll need to find the most public pool around, and go at the busiest time. That\u2019ll distract him enough, surely, that he won\u2019t have any inappropriate reactions. Won\u2019t even think about how much he wants to touch more than is needed for therapeutic care.\nJust as bloody well the lad no longer needs help in the shower.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, hoping the trepidation he\u2019s feeling isn\u2019t showing. \u201cCourse I can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could get a personal trainer at the gym.\u201d They\u2019re in the car on the way back to the nick, and the guilt in James\u2019s voice tugs at Robbie again. \nIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the man\u2019s clearly feeling that he\u2019s asking too much, Robbie might have been tempted to let James work with a trainer. The best way to resist temptation, he knows from all his experience with human nature, is to stay out of its way altogether. If he\u2019s not close to a near-naked James, he can\u2019t have inappropriate thoughts and impulses, can he? But even as he considers that, his brain\u2019s flooded with images of James in the pool with a strong, muscular bloke who\u2019s swimming alongside him, supporting him when he needs it, and massaging up and down James\u2019s legs and back while he rests against the bar. \nNo. \n\u201cNo need to do that, man.\u201d Robbie can\u2019t let himself look at James. If the bloke so much as suspects how much Robbie wants to touch him, doesn\u2019t want anyone else to touch him... Christ, James would run all the way back to Prague. Robbie\u2019s not only being selfish by wanting to keep James to himself, he\u2019s betraying the man who\u2019s not only his sergeant but his friend. \nIt\u2019s only another couple of weeks. It\u2019s what he tells himself, and he knows that doesn\u2019t make it right, but once James\u2019s recovery is complete and the bloke\u2019s back to full strength, then everything will be back to normal. James will move back to his own flat, and Robbie won\u2019t ever need to see him near-naked again unless they happen to go to the gym together \u2014 which, probably, he should avoid, at least until he\u2019s got past these completely ridiculous reactions.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re absolutely sure?\u201d There\u2019s still a furrow in James\u2019s forehead, and hesitation in his voice.\n\u201cCompletely sure.\u201d The confidence in Robbie\u2019s voice does the trick; thirty years as a detective has taught him plenty about the art of hiding his true reactions. James nods, smiling in what looks like genuine relief, and it\u2019s agreed. \u201cPool tonight after work, then?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be too bad in the pool, Robbie\u2019d reassured himself earlier. After all, there\u2019d be plenty of people around, in the pool and around the sides. Kids as well as adults. He\u2019d be too aware of being in the public eye to have any kind of inappropriate reaction if he had to touch James in the pool.\nAnd then James had said he wanted to go in the last hour before closing. He didn\u2019t want to be limping around and clearly needing Robbie\u2019s support with more people looking on than could possibly be helped. And \u2014 and Robbie\u2019s still kicking himself for not having thought of that \u2014 more people in the pool means more chance of James\u2019s leg getting accidentally banged. It\u2019s worse than that, too \u2014 it\u2019ll be too dangerous for him to use his crutches on the slippery tiles in the pool area, and probably the changing rooms as well, so he\u2019ll need Robbie\u2019s arm to get around, and to climb in and out of the pool.\nSo here they are at the Ferry Leisure Centre in Summertown at around quarter past nine. The pool\u2019s nearly empty and even the gym\u2019s emptying out. \nAnd James would prefer tight Speedos to the type of loose drawstring shorts Robbie wears. Fanbloodytastic.\nThen James takes his first unaided step since exiting the cubicle, and the instant agony on his face shoves all other thoughts out of Robbie\u2019s head. Bloody hell, what sort of thoughtless, selfish git is he? \n\u201cCome on, lean on me.\u201d He\u2019s next to James in an instant, his arm around the lad\u2019s waist, encouraging James to get closer. James\u2019s arm goes around Robbie\u2019s shoulders and they walk, slowly, carefully, across the wet tiles to the pool. From there, James holds onto the steps until Robbie\u2019s standing in the water, waiting for James to lower himself in.\nOnce they\u2019re both in, it\u2019s easy to see why swimming\u2019s recommended as good exercise. James isn\u2019t putting his body weight on the still-healing bone while he\u2019s giving the leg a decent workout. And it\u2019s easy for Robbie to focus on making sure that James isn\u2019t overdoing things, instead of letting his attention drift to completely inappropriate thoughts. \nAnd then he has to get James out of the pool. \nHe\u2019d thought it would be simple. They\u2019d swim to the shallow end, he\u2019d help James to sit on the steps, and then he could climb out himself and help James to push himself up from behind. The lad\u2019s got stronger biceps than anyone else Robbie\u2019s known, so it should have been straightforward.\nOnly it\u2019s not. James is knackered, and the lines around his temples and mouth reveal the pain he\u2019s deliberately not mentioning. Any movement seems to jolt his leg and cause greater pain. Robbie could try dragging him out from behind, but that\u2019ll shift his leg around even more and maybe bang it against the hard metal steps or, worse, the tile surround of the pool itself. And then, somehow, James has to stagger back to the cubicle \u2014 even with Robbie to lean on, he\u2019s going to find that agonising.\nThere\u2019s nothing else they can do, though. He stands in the water in front of James. \u201cThis is gonna hurt, man.\u201d\nJames shrugs faintly, the lines around his mouth accentuated in the fluorescent lights above the pool. \u201cWell, since I assume the alternative is me staying in here all night... what do you suggest?\u201d\n\u201cI either drag you out from behind, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea, or I get right up close to you here an\u2019 lift you up onto the tiles. Best away from the steps, though, because I don\u2019t want to bang your leg as we get you standing.\u201d\nJames nods, and the weariness in his eyes, combined with the obvious pain, twist at Robbie\u2019s stomach. \nOnce James has shuffled over a little and is leaning against the wall, Robbie moves in close, squatting a little so that he can get the right grip. \u201cAll right. Put your arms around my neck and brace yourself.\u201d James does, and Robbie grips around the bloke\u2019s hips, pushing up on his arse. As James lifts, Robbie moves in closer, until he\u2019s actually standing between James\u2019s thighs. Christ. Can they get any more intimate? He takes a deep breath, gives one more heave, and James reaches down to press his hands against the tiles, pulling himself up, and then he\u2019s sitting on the edge. Robbie breathes a sigh of relief.\nBy the time he\u2019s out of the pool, James is already half-standing, having used the bar of the steps to pull himself up. Robbie offers his arm to help him the rest of the way, \n \u201cOkay, arm around me,\u201d Robbie instructs James, wrapping his own arm against the lad\u2019s waist. \u201cLean on me as much as you need. You know I can bear your weight.\u201d \nThough, of course, when he did it before he\u2019d been fuelled by sheer desperation, the knowledge that he had seconds, at most, to get James out of that house before the whole place went up and took both of them with it. \nAnd, of course, then he didn\u2019t have a bad back. He\u2019s taking most of the weight of James now, and the tiles are slippery from a day\u2019s usage. James is gripping onto him tightly as he shuffles along next to Robbie, and Robbie\u2019s taking one careful step at a time, concentrating intently so that he doesn\u2019t even come close to losing his balance. The distance, which hadn\u2019t seemed long at all when he\u2019d helped James out, now seems almost impossible, James growing even increasingly heavy against him, making his back twist painfully.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d James gasps as his hip connects sharply with Robbie\u2019s when they turn into the changing-room. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Robbie shifts his grip, his hand sliding up James\u2019s slippery body as he tries to find a decent purchase. \u201cAlmost there.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a low mutter from James in response, which Robbie translates either as Thank God for that, or possibly something in Latin. Either\u2019s as likely, knowing James. \nOnly another fifteen or so feet now, but James is almost a dead weight, his body draped against Robbie\u2019s side, and Robbie\u2019s going to need a double dose of anti-inflammatories when he gets home. But he\u2019s not going to let James see that he\u2019s in pain. That would just ensure that James would refuse to let Robbie help him again, and the lad needs this. Who\u2019s going to take James to the pool and help him in and out, and with those exercises he\u2019s supposed to do in the water, if not Robbie?\nIt\u2019s a weight off his mind in more than just the literal sense when he\u2019s finally able to lower James down to the bench. Until his wrist brushes James\u2019s groin as he\u2019s letting go of the bloke, and what he feels, beyond any doubt, is rigid, hot flesh.\n\nJames is silent in the car, staring directly in front of him as they drive through the wet streets to Robbie\u2019s flat. The torrential rain and incessant thunder means that Robbie needs all his attention focused on driving anyway \u2014 not so much controlling his own car, but keeping eyes everywhere, including in the back of his head, for the sort of idiot who doesn\u2019t know how to drive in this weather and ends up causing an accident.\nA sudden flash of lightning illuminates James\u2019s face, strain visible in every line. The bloke\u2019s in a lot of pain, of course, and the sooner Robbie gets him home and gets painkillers inside him, the better. Knowing James Hathaway, he\u2019ll be embarrassed too, which is ridiculous. They\u2019re both blokes; they both know that kind of reaction can be prompted by lots of things, including some completely unrelated to any kind of sexual arousal. And with the amount of pain James was in, as well as the discomfort he had to be feeling at being carried over his boss\u2019s shoulder, there\u2019s no way it could have been sexual. What was even there for James to have a sexual reaction to?\nBack at the flat, once James has made his awkward, halting way inside, Robbie shoos him off to his bedroom, following him in a couple of minutes later with a glass of water and painkillers \u2014 once he\u2019s taken his own painkillers, of course. \u201cGot the kettle on, too, so I\u2019ll bring you a cuppa in a bit.\u201d \nJames accepts the painkillers, but shakes his head at the tea. \u201cI just need to sleep. Thanks.\u201d\nHis tone\u2019s more abrupt than Robbie would expect, but that\u2019s clearly the pain, too. Bugger. There\u2019s nothing for it. He managed to control his reactions last night, anyway, didn\u2019t he? He can do it again. And anyway, this isn\u2019t about him; it\u2019s about what James needs. \u201cAll right, canny lad. Let\u2019s get those jeans off you an\u2019 I\u2019ll give your leg a rub.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Again, it\u2019s sharper than Robbie would\u2019ve expected. And it\u2019s daft, too. James needs this \u2014 his doctor said so, apart from anything else, and James knows it\u2019s helped him before. But Robbie knows his stubborn sergeant, and there\u2019s no point arguing with him when he\u2019s like this, so closed-off and determined.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d He straightens, backing away. \u201cCall me if you change your mind, all right?\u201d\nJames\u2019s expression softens fractionally. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m s\u2014 I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019ll be fine in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cCourse you will.\u201d Easier just to agree; sometimes, it\u2019s one step at a time with James, even if those steps are occasionally backwards. \u201cNight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a right pig\u2019s ear of it, love.\u201d On one knee, Robbie carefully pulls out the dead flowers from the container on Val\u2019s grave. \u201cI must\u2019ve let him know the sort of things I\u2019ve been thinking. I thought I\u2019d been so careful, that the one saving grace was that he couldn\u2019t possibly know. But he must. The pain he was in last night, pet... there\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to help him, unless he\u2019s worked it out.\u201d\nOne by one, he threads the tiger lilies and autumn crocuses through the mesh, arranging the colourful stems as he does so. Val always did like bright colours in flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to talk to him about it, tell him... Oh, I\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019d tell him. That it\u2019s nothing? It\u2019ll go away once I\u2019m not needin\u2019 to touch him and be that close to him again?\u201d Robbie shakes his head. \u201cWhy would he believe it? An\u2019 anyway, it\u2019d only make him say I don\u2019t need to help him the way I\u2019ve been doing. And, knowing James, he\u2019d say it to make me feel better. Not himself. Things\u2019d never be the same between us again.\u201d\nHe stands, laying a hand on the top of the gravestone. \u201cAnd if I say nothing? Then what? He barely said a word at breakfast. It\u2019s there between us, eating away at both of us. We both know it\u2019s a problem, but we\u2019re not acknowledging it. Not that that\u2019s anything new with James, but when I\u2019ve ignored it before it\u2019s only made things far worse in the end.\u201d\nThere\u2019s clay on the knee of his good suit. Robbie bends to brush it off. The ground\u2019s still damp after last night\u2019s rain. Damn it, that\u2019s another suit that\u2019s got to go to the dry-cleaners, after that bloody awful crime scene he got called to give his opinion on yesterday afternoon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, though, pet. What if he keeps not letting me help him? It\u2019s not just the pain he\u2019s in, though seeing him like that\u2019s bad enough. If he doesn\u2019t get the help he needs \u2014 or, worse, if he starts trying to do too much himself \u2014 it could set his recovery back.\u201d Robbie sighs, long and loud. \u201cI know, you think I should talk to him, but \u2014 about this? I don\u2019t even understand it meself.\u201d\nBeing attracted to a bloke. Him. Robbie Lewis, the lifelong heterosexual. Well, all right, it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s not as simple as a straight binary line, no pun intended. But him \u2014 he\u2019s fifty-eight, was married to the same woman for twenty-five years, and never a hint that he might find his own gender attractive.\nDoes it matter? The hint of a voice in his head sounds just like Val\u2019s plain common sense, though could just as easily be his own conscience. A conscience that\u2019s currently prodding him to get back to the station. He only went out, he told James, to go to the bank. More than time he stopped procrastinating, then.\n\nThe office is empty when he gets back; both James and his crutches have gone. Before Robbie has a chance to check whether James left him a message, Julie sticks her head around the door. \u201cSergeant Hathaway asked me to let you know he\u2019s in Viewing Room Two, sir.\u201d\nRobbie nods his thanks and heads off in search of his missing bagman. He knocks, then walks straight into the room, finding James with his gaze focused on a monitor, noise-cancelling headphones dwarfing his narrow head. A couple of steps closer, and both what James is watching and the bright pink on his sergeant\u2019s face are visible.\n\u201cNot still blushin\u2019 at porn, are you?\u201d\nJames jumps and tears off his headphones. \u201cSir! I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d\n\u201cToo focused on what you were watchin\u2019, looks like.\u201d Before James can get defensive, Robbie perches on the edge of the desk. \u201cThat\u2019s the murder victim I got called out to look at last night,\u201d he comments with a frown.\nJames nods, his gaze kept studiously averted from Robbie. \u201cYes. They collected a lot of evidence from the house, so Innocent asked me to help the evidence officer go through it.\u201d\n\u201cAh. An\u2019 you got the... what, home movies?\u201d\nJames nods. \u201cThere\u2019s at least a dozen, all with the same woman, though a variety of partners. All very explicit... and violent. And all\u2014\u201d Now, he does turn to look at Robbie, pink still visible on his face and neck. \u201cClearly consensual, despite the brutality. There\u2019s no coercion anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Robbie drums his fingers on the side of the monitor, then gestures for the headphones. James passes them over, then restarts the video when Robbie signals. It only takes a few seconds for him to agree with James. There\u2019s violence, yes, including mock-strangulation, but it\u2019s all part of the sex-play. BDSM, and the woman who\u2019s on the receiving end of the rough play is very definitely in charge. And the location is the bedroom in the woman\u2019s house. \u201cSex game that went too far? And her partner panicked.\u201d He pulls a face. \u201cCan understand that, all right, but not phoning the police? Or coming forward when he saw on the news that the body was found?\u201d \nHe stands and indicates that James can stop the video. His sergeant does so with obvious relief. \u201cGet those locked away an\u2019 come and have a coffee. We can tell Laxton our conclusions after.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d The relief on James\u2019s face is obvious. It still surprises Robbie that the bloke gets so flustered with this sort of stuff; after all, they see it all the time on the job. But then, he had two years in Vice, and James didn\u2019t \u2014 and also, the bloke spent next to no time as a DC and no time at all in uniform. Julie, for example, would barely have blinked at this \u2014 not that he\u2019d tell James that.\n\u201cGo on, out an\u2019 get some fresh air,\u201d Robbie urges James. \u201cI\u2019ll get the coffee and join you.\u201d\nJames is more his normal self when Robbie finds him a few minutes later, sitting on an upturned crate with his crutches balanced against the wall beside him. Robbie passes over a paper cup of Americano from the posh espresso machine in the canteen. After what the lad\u2019s just had to endure, the standard dishwater wouldn\u2019t suffice. James\u2019s fingers twitch as he takes the cup, and Robbie frowns. \u201cNot still bothered, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Well, yes, but...\u201d James\u2019s lips twist downwards. \u201cNicotine craving. Haven\u2019t had one in weeks, but after that...\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNot going to. Don\u2019t even have any with me, anyway.\u201d He tilts his head back to lean against the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it affects me like... I mean, you can watch without batting an eyelid.\u201d\n\u201cDownside of the fast-track scheme,\u201d Robbie comments, an amused quirk to his lips. \u201cYou barely spent any time as a constable. You got away with not doing as much routine evidence-checking as most officers would at the start of their careers. You\u2019re just not used to it, not the way most of the others are.\u201d\nJames nods agreement. \u201cIt does make sense.\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is I need to spend more time on the scut-work?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft. Need your massive brain wi\u2019me, don\u2019t I? Besides, what do you think Innocent\u2019d say if she found out her preferred candidate for the next inspector vacancy was wasting his skills on DC tasks? You know how to do the work, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\u201cShe can wait,\u201d James mutters darkly. It\u2019s a conversation they\u2019ve had once or twice before, of course, and Robbie\u2019s still not certain whether James intends to push on with his career once Robbie retires, or whether he\u2019s daft enough to mean what he said a year or so ago about going if Robbie did. Ah well, he\u2019s got a few years left to work on the lad.\nFor now, though, the encouraging thing is that James isn\u2019t avoiding him the way he did this morning. Maybe all the awkwardness is out of the way.\n\nIt feels like it might be. At home, James has to do some resistance exercises, which require Robbie to press his palm against James\u2019s lower calf and have James push against it to try to raise his leg. James seems perfectly amenable to doing it with Robbie\u2019s help, and even talks a bit while they\u2019re at it, until the effort of pushing becomes too much for him to carry on a conversation at the same time.\nDespite the pain his exertions are clearly causing him, James carries on long past Robbie\u2019s urging him to stop. Stubborn bastard, he is \u2014 but then this kind of thing isn\u2019t new to him. Once, James described the exercise regimes he had to go through daily and weekly as a rower. It\u2019d left Robbie \u2014 who considers himself generally fit, and he\u2019d done a lot of extra exercise in his rugby-playing days \u2014 exhausted at the mere thought. \nFinally, James declares himself finished and says he\u2019s off for a shower. Robbie helps him up and passes him the crutches. \u201cGet yourself on the bed after an\u2019 I\u2019ll give your leg a massage, yeah?\u201d\nBut he gets a quick head-shake. \u201cNot necessary. I\u2019ll just use the heating pad, if you wouldn\u2019t mind putting it in the microwave for me in about ten minutes?\u201d\nRobbie does, and makes his suggestion again when he brings the pad into James\u2019s bedroom once he hears the bloke going back in there after his shower. But James, a towel resting over his hips and thighs, politely insists that it\u2019s not necessary. \nAnd, recognising the desperate plea in his friend\u2019s eyes, an expression he\u2019s only ever see James wear a couple of times before, Robbie retreats.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time I moved back home.\u201d Over breakfast the next day, James\u2019s tone is upbeat as he makes the announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t need the crutches all the time now, and I can get someone to drive me back and forth. I\u2019ve presumed on your goodwill long enough.\u201d Robbie\u2019s about to interrupt to insist that\u2019s not the case, but James continues, \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to get home.\u201d\nRobbie wants to argue. But several things are making themselves very apparent to him right now.\nJames is embarrassed. Despite his apparently carefree tone, his fists are closed so tightly the knuckles are white. And \u2014 very surprising for someone who\u2019s so observant when they\u2019re speaking to suspects and witnesses \u2014 he\u2019s not trying to hide the tell. That says he\u2019s either not aware of it, or he\u2019s too wound up to have the presence of mind to hide.\nEmbarrassed about the pool still? Or is he suspicious about Robbie\u2019s motives? He\u2019d been fine with Robbie yesterday at work, and here in the evening. But he\u2019s backing away from any hint of intimacy, isn\u2019t he? Well, only to be expected. It\u2019s got to be weird being that close to your boss, and now that James is just about recovered enough not to be as dependent on Robbie, it\u2019s just about possible that he really just wants his own space. And the embarrassment... well, maybe Robbie would\u2019ve been embarrassed if he\u2019d had to be repeatedly near-naked around Morse, and Morse\u2019d needed to touch him and get as close as he\u2019s been to James, to help him. \nThough, however much Robbie rationalises it, he can\u2019t shake the feeling that James does suspect something about how Robbie\u2019d reacted to him.\nEven if he doesn\u2019t, James clearly wants to get away from Robbie\u2019s flat \u2014 from Robbie. So he can\u2019t insist that the bloke stays, no matter that James shouldn\u2019t be managing on his own yet. It\u2019s not fair to James.\nAnd... the inappropriateness of all of this. He\u2019s James\u2019s boss. Language from the numerous managerial seminars and briefings he\u2019s attended over the years is assaulting him: breach of trust, conflict of interest, abuse of power. \nWith all of that... even if he felt capable of talking to James about what might be going on: about his own reactions to the bloke, about James\u2019s arousal at the pool, how could he possibly? It\u2019s not only that James couldn\u2019t possibly be attracted to Robbie \u2014 that was just friction at the pool, after all, wasn\u2019t it? \u2014 but also that their working relationship puts a completely different slant on any conversation of that nature. He\u2019s James\u2019s boss: what if... Well, James\u2019d know better than to imagine Robbie would put any kind of pressure on him, either to respond in kind or to keep Robbie\u2019s admission a secret. \nBut, knowing James, he would feel obliged to behave no differently at work, even if he felt uncomfortable around Robbie. Wouldn\u2019t he? Or he\u2019d ask Innocent to be reassigned, despite how much Robbie knows James likes being his sergeant.\nNo, Robbie can\u2019t talk to James about any of this, for the man\u2019s own sake.\nHe has to let James make up his own mind. Even if it does mean Robbie\u2019s going to be worried sick about him in that flat on his own with a still-dodgy leg, and no-one to help him with exercises. \n\u201cAll right. If it\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll take you over there after work.\u201d\n\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\nRobbie\u2019s got conditions on James returning home, and he won\u2019t hesitate to pull rank as he lays them out. He insists that he\u2019ll drive James back and forth to the nick, unless he can\u2019t because work gets in the way. And James has to promise to phone him at any time, day or night, if he needs help.\u201cThen there\u2019s your exercises,\u201d he continues as he helps James to pack. \u201cYou need help with those. Your doctor said.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d James glances his way only briefly. \u201cI found out today that Gurdip swims regularly. He says he\u2019ll be happy to help me in the pool. That way I won\u2019t be putting your back at risk.\u201dSo much for thinking he\u2019d managed to hide that from James. He would have to have a bloody observant sod for a sergeant.\u201cAnd,\u201d James continues, \u201cI can do the resistance exercises at work. It\u2019s probably a better time, before I\u2019m too tired to want to do them. Gurdip offered to help with those, too.\u201d James pauses in the act of putting folded clothes in his holdall. \u201cI really am very grateful for everything you\u2019ve done, Robbie. And I know you\u2019ve told me over and over that you don\u2019t mind, but I can\u2019t keep depending on you. It doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s time everything got back to normal.\u201dIt feels right to Robbie, and he\u2019s not that bothered how quickly things go back to normal, but it\u2019s James\u2019s decision. Apart from anything else, it\u2019s completely possible that he\u2019s found living with his boss to be cramping his style, or whatever today\u2019s youth call it.Back in his empty flat later, Robbie strips the bed James had been using and tidies up a bit, then finds himself on the sofa with no idea what to do next. Nothing on the telly\u2019s appealing, and he\u2019s just not interested in tackling the hoovering or any of the other bits of housework that have been accumulating. He even considers going back to work, but dismisses the idea as it\u2019s almost ten o\u2019clock. Instead, he just watches the news, occasionally voicing aloud his opinion on politicians or other public figures who are making headlines tonight. There\u2019s no smartarse comeback to any of his comments. He gives it up as a bad job and just goes to bed.\nJames, when Robbie picks him up the following morning, is irritatingly cheerful. He\u2019s clearly had a good night\u2019s sleep, with none of the tossing and turning Robbie\u2019s had. Being back in his own flat\u2019s done him good.And once in the office, James vanishes off as soon as he\u2019s checked his email and dealt with the urgent tasks in his in-tray. Julie Lockhart, who\u2019s recently become a DC, has just been on a week\u2019s training in suspect interviewing, and needs to get some practice in. A team of DCs, under James\u2019s supervision, just arrested a gang of twenty-somethings for a spate of burglaries with menace, and so Julie\u2019s going to be doing some of the interviews, accompanied by James.It\u2019s quiet in their shared office, and the working day is bloody tedious, since Robbie\u2019s got no fewer than three reports to write for Innocent. He\u2019d normally hand one of them off to James; team statistics is far more Hathaway\u2019s cup of tea, and he\u2019s good at the pretty graphics and Excel tables Innocent likes. Beyond the shared work, James is also good for keeping Robbie\u2019s spirits up with his well-timed smartarse comments and wry smiles \u2014 and, of course, somehow knowing exactly when Robbie needs a cuppa or a bite to eat.It\u2019s late afternoon before James returns to the office, leaning heavily on his crutches despite putting weight on his healing leg. Robbie catches the bloke\u2019s eye, sending a silent but clear message that James has been overdoing it, in his opinion. \u201cBefore you say anything, I\u2019ve just done twenty minutes of resistance exercises with Gurdip.\u201d The undertone of antagonism in James\u2019s voice is bloody annoying, considering Robbie\u2019s not actually spoken at all, much less levelled an accusation.And if anyone should be put out here, it\u2019s Robbie. Yes, it makes sense for James to do those exercises during the day \u2014 but why does he have to search out Gurdip? Why not let Robbie help him, just as Robbie\u2019s done every day since a couple of days after James\u2019s accident? Why\u2019s Robbie suddenly become a pariah?But he knows why, and that\u2019s why he won\u2019t say a word. Best to keep a professional distance, and hope that James soon concludes that he was wrong about Robbie\u2019s interest in him.\u201cAll right, well, \u2018bout time you got back. Got a report for you to finish.\u201d He shoves the manila folder in James\u2019s direction and emails the draft. \u201cTeam stats. Your favourite.\u201dJames rolls his eyes. \u201cOh, wonderful. You do know how to make me feel appreciated, sir.\u201dRobbie suppresses a smirk. \u201cKeep that up an\u2019 I\u2019ll show you me appreciation even more when Innocent wants the quarterly budgetary analysis.\u201d But he gets up, leaving the office with a \u201cBack in five minutes,\u201d and returns bearing decent coffee \u2014 as decent as can be had in the canteen \u2014 and a couple of scones, and all harmony\u2019s restored.When James emails him the completed \u2014 and, of course, written with so many bloody multi-syllable words that Robbie\u2019s going to have to edit it before sending it to Innocent \u2014 statistical report, Robbie grunts his thanks, then looks around his monitor. \u201cPint on the way home?\u201dBut James instantly shakes his head with a regretful grimace. \u201cI would, but Gurdip suggested going to the pool he uses straight after work. He says it doesn\u2019t get busy until around seven.\u201dGurdip again. And the disappointment that slams into Robbie takes him by surprise; it\u2019s only a bloody pint. Still, he can\u2019t blame the lad for doing everything he can to aid his recovery.All the same, he can\u2019t help the images that suddenly flood his mind: Gurdip in the pool with James; Gurdip supporting him while he swims; Gurdip helping him out of the pool, their wet bodies pressed tightly together the way his and James\u2019s were just a couple of nights ago.No. It\u2019s not right to be thinking about James like this, and now he\u2019s bloody bringing someone else into it, too. Christ, he\u2019s in danger of becoming a pervert. What James does outside work is his own business, and he has a right not to have his boss thinking about him in completely inappropriate ways.\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He has to exert stern control to keep his voice sounding normal. \u201cMaybe tomorrow?\u201dJames nods, pushing himself to his feet and reaching for his crutches. Robbie wants to caution him not to overdo it, but stops himself; it\u2019s none of his business, after all, is it? He\u2019s only James\u2019s boss.\nThe three am callout two mornings later doesn\u2019t improve Robbie\u2019s mood much, after a frustrating evening spent trying to make sense of the file on another senior officer\u2019s stalled case passed to him by Innocent. Standing in Port Meadow in torrential rain waiting for Laura to finish her initial examination of a body in situ, with a DC who\u2019s slow to arrive and then hasn\u2019t even thought to bring an umbrella... it\u2019s enough to make him start thinking again about retirement.By the time the body\u2019s finally moved, more than two hours later, and he\u2019s reminded the DC about proper procedure in beginning an investigation, Robbie\u2019s soaked through and just wants to get home for a shower and change of clothes. He calls James to let his sergeant know he\u2019ll need to arrange a lift for himself into work. \u201cBody in Port Meadow, sir?\u201d James asks before Robbie\u2019s even had to explain. \u201cI heard you had Callaghan.\u201d The dry tone speaks volumes.\u201cWas he off sick the day you did crime-scene training?\u201d Robbie grumbles. He doesn\u2019t bother asking how James knows. The bloke\u2019s got eyes and ears everywhere \u2014 but then, such is the mark of a good sergeant. There was barely a thing Morse got up to in Robbie\u2019s absence that he didn\u2019t get informed about.\u201cHe won\u2019t be next time,\u201d James promises with an edge to his voice. \u201cGo and get dry, sir. I\u2019ll make my own way in and see you later.\u201dIt\u2019s not even a three-minute conversation, and yet Robbie feels warmed through by the time he presses the End button. He got bloody lucky the day Hathaway asked to be given first refusal, didn\u2019t he?A little over an hour later, Robbie enters his squad-room to see the team hard at work. There\u2019s an evidence board already under way, with photos and key information, and evidence boxes are stacked up on a large table with four or five officers sorting through them. James, with no crutches today \u2014 or maybe they\u2019re in the office \u2014 has Callaghan in a corner and is clearly providing chastisement as well as instruction, judging by the crestfallen look on the DC\u2019s face.Robbie heads into his office, intending to dispose of his coat before joining the team for an update \u2014 and halts by his desk as he notices the cardboard cup sitting there, the brand name emblazoned on it declaring that this isn\u2019t canteen coffee. And next to it is a paper bag, which Robbie opens to reveal his favourite almond pastry from the same posh coffee-shop.Of course James would know he hasn\u2019t had breakfast, and that his energy levels are dipping after the early start and prolonged drenching. Robbie turns in place to look back out through the window to where James is still talking to Callaghan. As if drawn by Robbie\u2019s attention, James glances around and their gazes meet. Robbie nods, and James\u2019s lips curve very slightly upwards. And Robbie\u2019s chest does a mini-somersault, even as he sags back against the edge of his desk as realisation sinks in.  It wasn\u2019t just the frustration of Grainger\u2019s stalled case that had him on edge and moody last night and made him sleep poorly even before the phone-call that woke him. It isn\u2019t just missing the gentle wind-down of after-work pints with James that has him going home unable to relax, that\u2019s made the flat seem bare and unwelcoming.And it wasn\u2019t just Callaghan\u2019s lack of preparedness this morning that made the job at the crime scene so tedious.It\u2019s all been about James, or, more specifically, the absence of James. James, who is no longer staying at Robbie\u2019s flat, and who\u2019s gone off in the company of Gurdip every evening since he moved out, and who therefore hasn\u2019t been available for pints, for sharing meals, or for just generally being around and keeping Robbie company.And it hasn\u2019t been just temporary inappropriate attraction all those evenings when he wanted to keep touching James, and all the times he\u2019s found himself thinking about it since.It\u2019s none of that. The last time he felt anything like this... attachment... to someone, this need caused by the absence of someone, was when Val was alive. That time when the kids were away and she went off to see her sister, he was like a lost soul.Christ, he\u2019s only somehow gone and tripped arse over tit for the bloke. For his own sergeant.Bloody fucking hell, what\u2019s he supposed to do now?\nThankfully, the next few days keep him busy enough that figuring out how to deal with his more than inconvenient feelings for his sergeant is the least of his worries. It isn\u2019t just the current murder; Innocent\u2019s short on senior staff due to unexpected sick leave on top of having one inspector on holiday and another on a training course, and Robbie\u2019s been directed to supervise a second team as well as his own. The other team\u2019s handling a complicated series of assaults that may have a hate-crime motive, and the team\u2019s DS is relatively inexperienced and struggling a bit. Robbie has to delegate most of his own case to James \u2014 who is, of course, more than capable of handling it and doesn\u2019t need Robbie looking over his shoulder \u2014 and spend most of his time with the other team.Maxwell, the DS, has potential. She\u2019s just been working for a DI who doesn\u2019t follow through very well on his responsibility to train junior offices. Maxwell\u2019s good at organising the routine stuff and at attention to detail. She just hasn\u2019t had much opportunity to talk through strategy and theorising, so when Robbie asks her to take him through some areas where she thinks they might be making weak assumptions, she\u2019s lost. So, for the rest of the week, he spends at most half an hour with his own team, most of it in a morning briefing where James takes the lead, and then a quick meeting with James to go over strategy. James texts or phones him if there are significant updates, but even then he leaves any actions to James. He isn\u2019t even seeing James outside the nick; given the time Robbie\u2019s spending on this other case, James is getting a PC to pick him up each morning, and Gurdip\u2019s taking him either to the gym or swimming in the evenings. It\u2019s not until there\u2019s been a major breakthrough in the murder case and James has arrested, interviewed and is ready to charge their suspect that Robbie pulls himself away from the other team and comes to join James in the custody suite. The charge-sheet is ready and the suspect, handcuffed, is already out of the cells. And Robbie recognises him: he was one of the gawkers at the murder site at godawful o\u2019clock that first morning. And he knows damn well that, if it had been James and not Callaghan at the scene that morning, this man could have been questioned days ago.It\u2019s only once their suspect is charged and James turns to head for the stairs that Robbie notices what he thinks he should have been aware of before now. James is limping \u2014 badly \u2014 and is clearly in pain. His step falters every so often, at a guess when a movement jars or sends a stab of pain through him. Robbie should have noticed sooner, and if he hadn\u2019t been spending almost all his time with the other team, he would have. And would have done something about it.Robbie waits until they\u2019re upstairs and in their office \u2014 and it\u2019s not easy watching James almost drag himself up the stairs \u2014 until he says anything. \u201cJames, what\u2014\u201d\u201cBefore you say anything\u2014\u201d With an exhausted sigh, James drops carefully into his chair. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been overdoing things. I\u2019ve already told Gurdip I\u2019m going to give the swimming a miss tonight.\u201dRobbie nods. \u201cGood.\u201d James shifts a bit in his chair, then winces and reaches behind him to rub at his lower back. Bloody hell. He really has been pushing himself too hard. \u201cCome back to mine tonight instead. Or I\u2019ll drive you to yours an\u2019 come in for a while. You need a hot shower and a proper massage.\u201dJames\u2019s head jerks up, his expression startled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you to any\u2014\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Robbie perches on the edge of James\u2019s desk. \u201cDon\u2019t be daft, man. You can\u2019t carry on like this. Please, let me help you.\u201d He waits until James is actually meeting his gaze. \u201cBesides, you know what\u2019ll happen if Laura sees you like this.\u201dAlarm covers James\u2019s face, his eye wide. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\u201cYeah, an\u2019 bear in mind you won\u2019t be the only one she comes after.\u201d He reaches out and pats James\u2019s shoulder. \u201dCome on. You\u2019ve done good work the last few days. Think we can knock off an hour or so early \u2014 do Maxwell good to look after things by herself for a bit.\u201dJames just nods, then pushes himself upwards and to his feet. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk daft. Now, pub first, or straight home?\u201d\nThey end up at the Vicky Arms, but the heavens open just as Robbie pulls into the car park. Robbie pulls a face. \u201cBeer garden\u2019s out.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Not smoking, remember.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Robbie gets out of the car. \u201cWondered if you\u2019d start again now your leg\u2019s nearly good as new.\u201dHis words feel ironic as he notices how awkwardly James is walking. But James doesn\u2019t comment on that. \u201cGonna try to stay off them. It\u2019s been almost two months, after all. I can\u2019t remember when I last managed to stop smoking for that long. I\u2019m almost at the point of losing the craving. Not quite, but...\u201d He shrugs faintly, reaching for the pub door. \u201cIt\u2019s worth persevering. I just need to stop needing something to do with my hands at times when I\u2019d normally smoke.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Robbie spots an empty table in a corner and gestures James towards it. \u201cJust don\u2019t start cracking your knuckles or anything like that.\u201dJames turns to face him full-on, a sarky grin on his face, and ostentatiously cracks the first two knuckles of his right hand. Robbie shakes his head. \u201cCut that out, or I\u2019ll put you back on the spurious glamour. Now, get yourself over there an\u2019 take the weight off your feet.\u201dIt\u2019s nice, this, Robbie muses as he stands at the bar waiting to be served. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been for a pint together since James got the walking cast, and that\u2019d been the first in ages too. He\u2019s missed it, this companionable time over a drink at the end of a day\u2019s work \u2014 at least on those days when they can knock off at a reasonable time, which is probably less than half of the time.It wasn\u2019t so bad while James was still staying with him, but of course over the past week he\u2019s really felt the absence, as if one of the main supports of his daily life were missing. And it\u2019s not just the drink, or the winding down. It\u2019s all James.Waiting for the pints to be poured, he glances back to where James is now sitting at their table, scrolling through something on his phone. Typical Hathaway; always has to be doing something to keep that massive brain of his occupied.\u201cThat\u2019ll be \u00a35.76, mate.\u201d Robbie drags himself out of his abstraction and turns to face the barman. As he hands over the cash, he notices the man give him an odd look. Christ, he\u2019d just been staring at James, and he must\u2019ve had some kind of dopey look on his face, mustn\u2019t he?Daft beggar, isn\u2019t he? At his time of life, and over a bloke \u2014 and a bloke young enough to be his son, what\u2019s more. It shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise, this. Well, the sexual attraction, yes. But the rest? He\u2019s loved James for years, hasn\u2019t he? It\u2019s just typical of his daft self that he never realised it before now. Laura would\u2019ve \u2014 in fact, she more than likely has. Rushing off to Prague at a moment\u2019s notice just because James was in an accident? You don\u2019t do that for someone you\u2019re just fond of, do you?As Robbie puts their drinks on the table and takes the bench opposite, James smiles up at him, a rare, unguarded smile that does nothing for Robbie\u2019s confidence in his ability to hide his feelings for the lad indefinitely. \u201cCheers.\u201d\u201cCheers.\u201d Robbie taps his glass against James\u2019s.After a sip, James says, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to say, sir \u2014 much as I miss your cheery self around the office, I\u2019m glad that Maxwell\u2019s getting the benefit of working under you.\u201d\u201cTold you, Robbie out of the office.\u201d He takes a long gulp. Feels as if he\u2019s not had a decent drink in weeks. \u201cMaxwell? She\u2019s got potential. Just needs a bit of steering in the right direction sometimes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean. Her governor\u2019s Kent.\u201d James doesn\u2019t elaborate, but then again he doesn\u2019t need to. \u201cCall me naive, but I wonder why Innocent doesn\u2019t do anything. Surely she\u2019s interested in making sure promoted officers get proper training.\u201d\u201cAlready planning to have a word. I think she does know, but short of lookin\u2019 over Kent\u2019s shoulder...\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnyway, didn\u2019t look like you missed me. Did a bloody good job without me, didn\u2019t you? Nice collar, an\u2019 even better work with the interviewing. Innocent said so, too.\u201dJames dips his head. \u201cI did learn from the best. Still, I\u2019ll be happier when you\u2019re back and I\u2019m cleared for full duties.\u201dRobbie nods. \u201cYou won\u2019t be for a bit, not the way you were walking this afternoon, man. How long\u2019s the pain been this bad?\u201dJames shrugs, looking uncomfortable with the question. \u201cA day? Maybe two. It\u2019s fine, Robbie. Rowing training was worse.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t recovering from a broken bone when you were in training for rowing,\u201d Robbie points out. \u201cCome on. Get that down you an\u2019 we\u2019ll head back to mine. Takeaway, an\u2019 then I\u2019ll sort you out.\u201d The cream he\u2019d used before is still in the spare bedroom, after all.James drains his glass. \u201cThis time, I\u2019m not stupid enough to say no.\u201d\nDinner\u2019s a takeaway meze from a Lebanese restaurant they both enjoy, though James chides Robbie about eating healthier. He will, Robbie promise, if James will teach him some simple recipes that don\u2019t take an hour or more to cook. Glutton for punishment, he is. The more time he spends with James outside work, and outside a safe, public environment like a pub, the greater the danger of letting something slip. And then what? James couldn\u2019t be anything other than embarrassed, and things would never be the same between them, in work as well as out.Well, the answer\u2019s simple, then, isn\u2019t it? Let nothing slip. He\u2019s got more than thirty years\u2019 experience of hiding his thoughts and reactions from others, hasn\u2019t he? Basic skill of being a detective, after all.James starts clearing dishes away, but his stiff movements make it immediately obvious that he\u2019s still in pain. Robbie takes the plates from him. \u201cGo on, get yourself sorted and onto the bed. I\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201dThere\u2019s no argument, only a grateful nod, and James heads off to the spare bedroom. Robbie detours via the bathroom first, to wash his hands but, more important, to splash cold water on his face and wrists. Anything to reduce the risk of giving himself away.In the bedroom, James is sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed in his shirt and underwear, with his suit on a hanger. The awkward, uncertain expression on his face tears at Robbie; what has he done to put that there? \u201cYou all right?\u201d he asks, pausing just inside the door. \u201cThought you\u2019d be ready by now.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d James gives him just a hint of a wry smile. \u201cThe last couple of times you helped me, I got the feeling you were... uncomfortable... with this. I wondered if I should\u2014\u201d He tugs at his shirt. \u201c\u2014cover up a bit more.\u201dBugger. He\u2019d been so focused on trying not to let James see what was really on his mind, and now the bloke\u2019s gone and assumed something else entirely, that Robbie\u2019s some kind of throwback who\u2019s repulsed at the sight of another bloke\u2019s naked body. \u201cNo. Nothing like that. It\u2019s fine. Go on.\u201d He gestures towards the bed. \u201cTell me where it hurts.\u201dJames stands facing Robbie and, in a fluid movement, pulls his shirt over his head. And it\u2019s just as well that, for a split second, the lad\u2019s face is hidden in the cotton of the garment, because the muscled, athletic body that\u2019s revealed makes Robbie catch his breath. James\u2019s skin, at least above his waist, is smooth and pale, with a sheen like alabaster. He really does belong in the Ashmolean, except that his skin\u2019s warm and the pulse beating just below the surface is a reminder that he\u2019s very much alive.\u201cOkay, on the bed with you.\u201d Robbie\u2019s voice is gruff, and he can\u2019t help it.Obediently, James lowers himself down, initially with some awkwardness because of his aching leg and hip, and arranges himself face-downwards, head resting on folded arms. Like last time, he\u2019s wearing skin-tight black underwear that hides nothing of the curve of his backside, or the bulge visible between his legs.Robbie swallows and takes a couple of deep breaths. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d he prompts again. \u201cBack of your thigh, calf, lower back?\u201d\u201cEverywhere,\u201d James mutters, his tone suggesting that he\u2019d like to consign the reason for the pain to the dampest, most unpleasant-smelling holding cell to be found in the old Cowley nick.Carefully, to avoid jolting James, Robbie sits on the side of the bed, then coats his fingers in cream. And then he hesitates. Before, getting started was easy. This was James, his sergeant, his friend, who was in pain and in need of relief, and all Robbie wanted was to help him. Now, he still wants that, but on top of that need is the awareness that James isn\u2019t just his sergeant and friend. That he wants to touch the man, and not to ease his pain. That he loves James, and wants James to love him in return.And none of that matters. It\u2019s not why Robbie invited James here, and it\u2019s not why James is entrusting himself to Robbie like this. The only reason James is here is that he\u2019s in pain and Robbie has the means to ease his aching muscles, at least a little. Even if he\u2019d like it to be more than that, it isn\u2019t.He flexes his fingers again, and gets started.It\u2019s easy then. He can feel the tight muscles under his fingertips, the areas where knots have formed and where James has overdone or overcompensated his efforts to make his body behave the way he wants it to. It\u2019s easy to focus on working the tightness out and feeling James relax beneath his hands.So he keeps going, past the point where James isn\u2019t tense any more and where he\u2019s resting his head on the pillow now, eyes closed. Relaxing, maybe close to sleep, and given the dark smudges around his eyes over the last couple of days, Robbie\u2019s pretty certain that James hasn\u2019t been sleeping well lately. If he falls asleep here, it\u2019ll be a bloody good thing.Robbie rubs his hands over James\u2019s lower back once more, then over the rounded curve of his backside and then along both sides of his thigh, fingers and thumbs gentling as he moves. And James makes a sound. Not a protest, not a yawn, but something close to a moan.Fuck. He\u2019s not massaging any more. He\u2019s stroking.\nRobbie jerks his hands away. And, instantly, James protests, his voice sleepy and almost petulant, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201dAnd Robbie\u2019s still trying to make sense of that when James sits up, the movement abrupt and sheepish. \u201cSorry. Sorry. I \u2014 I must\u2019ve thought\u2014\u201d He ducks his head, avoiding Robbie\u2019s gaze, and his hands are pressed together, covering his underwear. \u201cI apologise, sir.\u201d Now his voice is stiff, full of embarrassment, matching the pink flush around the back of his neck. \u201cThat was extremely inappropriate. If you\u2019ll give me a minute to get dressed, I\u2019ll leave.\u201dRobbie\u2019s not got a clue what\u2019s happening here. But there\u2019s one thing he does know. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, man.\u201d On pure instinct, wanting to reassure, he lays a hand on James\u2019s shoulder, pressing firmly.James trembles faintly under his touch.What the\u2014? Has James figured it out, or known all along? But that doesn\u2019t explain...And then it all makes sense. What\u2019s happened just now, together with what happened at the pool and James\u2019s reluctance to be alone with him since then. What James is hiding with his hands.He strokes his hand backwards and forwards over James\u2019s shoulder and upper arm. A very faint sigh comes from the man next to him.Encouraged, testing, Robbie slides his hand around the back of James\u2019s neck. James leans very slightly closer to him. He moves his hand upwards, cupping the back of James\u2019s head, fingers sliding through his hair. James drops his head onto Robbie\u2019s shoulder.Ah. And the tight grip Robbie\u2019s been holding on himself ever since that last evening in this very room eases and slips away. He inclines his own head sideways until it\u2019s resting against James\u2019s. With his free hand, he reaches across and grips James\u2019s clenched fist, smoothing out the long fingers and wrapping his around them. Taking  hold of James, his canny lad. And that says it all for both of them, feels like.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything.\u201d James\u2019s voice shatters the silence that\u2019s lain between them for the past... feels like at least ten minutes.Robbie shifts, raising his head and turning to look at this lovely lad who might, just maybe, turn out to be for him. He keeps his grasp on James\u2019s head, though. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201dJames\u2019s fingers clench in Robbie\u2019s grip. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve figured out. I didn\u2019t make it very difficult for you, did I? But if you\u2019re willing to keep me \u2014 as your sergeant, I mean \u2014 I promise it\u2019ll never get in the way. It\u2019ll be as if this never happened.\u201dRobbie huffs, a long-suffering sigh he knows James is very familiar with. \u201cYou daft sod. Does this feel as if I want you to forget it?\u201d He leans in closer and presses a kiss to the crown of James\u2019s head. \u201cSome detective you are, if that\u2019s what you think. You never noticed you weren\u2019t the only one?\u201dBlue eyes wide open in shock stare at him, until after a moment or two James shakes his head in rueful denial. \u201cI was too busy trying to hide my reaction to everything you did. It never occurred to me to look for any signs from you.\u201d\u201cDaft sod.\u201d But then Robbie relents, smiling crookedly. \u201cNot as if I realised what you wanted, either. Not till just now.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure...?\u201d James\u2019s gaze sweeps Robbie\u2019s face, searching for any hint of doubt.\u201cWouldn\u2019t say so if I wasn\u2019t.\u201dJames\u2019s expression alters abruptly, as if he\u2019s just let go of every guard he\u2019s ever put up against the world around him. And it\u2019s all there: longing, need, desire, yes; but more besides. Robbie\u2019s not the only one who wants this to be more than a casual shag, an affair conducted behind closed doors that\u2019ll burn itself out in weeks, if not sooner.Which means it\u2019ll have to be handled very carefully, for James\u2019s sake.James slowly raises his hand to Robbie\u2019s face, then traces with his fingertip around eyes, nose, lips, chin, and then back to drag his finger over, and between, Robbie\u2019s lips. He leans closer. \u201cI want to kiss you.\u201dRobbie moves back, halting James\u2019s movement. \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cWhat? I thought you wanted...?\u201dRobbie squeezes James\u2019s hand, offering more reassurance in the face of the lad\u2019s confusion. \u201cI do. It\u2019s just not as simple as that.\u201dJames calms, his expression trusting, which makes Robbie hope he\u2019ll never do anything to lose that faith in him.He\u2019s barely had time to think this through \u2014 it\u2019s not as if he ever imagined that James would remotely feel the same way he does. But there\u2019s only one clear solution. \u201cI\u2019m telling Innocent tomorrow I\u2019m putting you forward for OSPRE.\u201dIt\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t know that this is a point of contention for James. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201dHe holds tight to the lad\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m your boss, man! We can\u2019t do anything like this while you still report to me. It wouldn\u2019t be right. It\u2019s not fair to you.\u201dThere are sparks of anger in James\u2019s eyes, though he doesn\u2019t attempt to free his hand. \u201cIf you mean anything along the lines of abuse of power, that\u2019s ridiculous. I know you\u2019d never take advantage of this in our working relationship, and you should know yourself better than that.\u201d\u201cI know I wouldn\u2019t. Know you wouldn\u2019t either, come to that. But that\u2019s not the point.\u201d His thumb strokes across the back of James\u2019s hand. After a couple of moments, James nods reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s how it looks, isn\u2019t it? Especially if Innocent finds out. She\u2019ll be the one asking me if you\u2019ve done anything that might constitute harassment or taking advantage.\u201dRobbie nods. \u201cI\u2019m not worried for meself, though, man. I mean, if it came to it, I\u2019d just retire. It\u2019s you \u2014 your career. You know this\u2019d cause problems in the team if anyone found out. Some of the lads in the team already think you get special treatment, which is bollocks, but if anyone suspects about this all hell will break loose.\u201dJames has been on the receiving end of too many barely-disguised insults and accusations of favouritism as it is. Robbie won\u2019t risk inviting any more of it.\u201cYou\u2019d bend over backwards to make sure you weren\u2019t being seen to treat me more favourably,\u201d James points out, and it\u2019s true.\u201cMaybe. Still, it\u2019s got the potential to be a problem, and you know it. Not to mention it\u2019d be bloody difficult for you to be me subordinate at work and then me...\u201d He hesitates, then decides on what seems to fit best. \u201cMe partner at home. Best if you\u2019re not reporting to me, an\u2019 you\u2019re good enough not to have to switch to being someone else\u2019s bagman. You really want to have to report to someone like Kent?\u201d James shakes his head in instant denial, and Robbie takes advantage of that in order to push his point. \u201cYou should be on the promotion track, even if someone other than me has to supervise you through it.\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d James\u2019s thumb is now stroking the side of Robbie\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit premature, though, isn\u2019t it? What if this doesn\u2019t last? I mean, you could decide the last thing you want is a relationship with a cleverclogs smartarse who doesn\u2019t know when to shut up.\u201dOr a relationship with a bloke. Or a relationship with James. Because that\u2019s at the root of this objection. James is genuinely worried that Robbie\u2019ll get tired of him, and of the novelty of a relationship that\u2019s unlike anything he\u2019s ever had before.And maybe, if this had happened before James had the accident and broke his leg, Robbie might have wondered the same thing. But a lot has happened since then. They\u2019ve got to know each other \u2014 and themselves \u2014 better as a result. They\u2019ve spent more time together than ever before. Robbie\u2019s come to realise how much having James in his life matters. How much James has filled an aching void that\u2019s been there ever since he lost Val.Not filled it completely \u2014 no-one could ever do that \u2014 but he\u2019s found his own space in Robbie\u2019s life and Robbie\u2019s heart. He belongs there, and Robbie just hopes that he belongs with James every bit as much. Some day, perhaps, he\u2019ll tell James that. For now, reassuring his bonny lad\u2019s easy. \u201cIf that was gonna happen, would\u2019ve been years ago.\u201d He bumps his shoulder against James\u2019s. \u201cLook, who knows if it\u2019ll work out. I think it will \u2014 but anyway, even if it didn\u2019t, could you go back to calling me sir and obeying orders from me, including stuff you don\u2019t want to do?\u201dJames snorts. \u201cDidn\u2019t I once say something about suffering and endurance? They\u2019re merely a sergeant\u2019s lot.\u201dRobbie raises an eyebrow. \u201cThe bedrock of a happy marriage, you said.\u201d And it strikes him that, yes, even then, three years ago, they were doing a pretty good imitation of being closer than many spouses. Laura\u2019d commented on it many times. Robbie\u2019d just never understood exactly what she\u2019d been getting at. Had James? Probably, he suspects now.\u201cAnyway, we need to do something.\u201d He resumes his gentle stroking of James\u2019s hair. \u201cInnocent\u2019ll be a lot more understanding if we\u2019re straight with her up front rather than risking her finding out herself. And it\u2019s not as if we\u2019d never see each other \u2014 or as if you wouldn\u2019t enjoy bein\u2019 the boss of your own team.\u201dJames nods slowly. That\u2019s progress.\u201cThere\u2019s Maxwell, for example. Needs a good DI to train her up an\u2019 give her confidence. You\u2019d be good at that.\u201d\u201cSo would you, if I weren\u2019t your DS any more,\u201d James points out, but Robbie can already see the wheels turning in his mind. \u201cWe\u2019re agreed? Tell Innocent an\u2019 you get ready to sit OSPRE?\u201d \u201cYes, all right, then!\u201d The words are impatient, and Robbie quickly finds out why. \u201cCan I kiss you now?\u201dAll the matter-of-factness of a moment ago has gone from James\u2019s voice, his expression, and Robbie finds himself responding to the impatient need he sees. \u201cThink you\u2019d better.\u201d\u201cWaited long enough,\u201d James mutters before leaning in, cupping Robbie around the back of his neck, and claiming a kiss that makes clear that, while James might be Robbie\u2019s subordinate at work, he\u2019s very much not so when it comes to their personal relationship.Not that Robbie intends to let the lad have it all his own way. He yanks James closer, taking full advantage of their clothing discrepancy by running his hands up and down James\u2019s naked back. \u201cNot fair,\u201d James grumbles, tearing his lips a bare inch away from Robbie\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more clothes on than I have.\u201d\u201cNot stoppin\u2019 you doing anything about that,\u201d Robbie points out before making clear that he\u2019s not finished kissing the bloke yet. Or doing other things. Plenty of other things. Just as well they\u2019re already on a bed, in fact.\nSomeone\u2019s nuzzling Robbie\u2019s ear, and a warm hand is stroking over his belly, sliding further downwards with every brush. Robbie reaches down and traps the hand in his. \u201cMight check I\u2019m awake before makin\u2019 free with me body.\u201dA low chuckle reverberates against his ear. \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake. I have incontrovertible evidence of that right here.\u201dRobbie rolls over, trapping James beneath him. \u201cNot the only one, I see.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d James wraps his arms around Robbie\u2019s back, then for good measure brings his lower legs up to seal Robbie\u2019s thighs in place. \u201cTake it your gammy leg\u2019s better this morning?\u201d \u201cMuch.\u201d James sucks gently just below Robbie\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019re much more skilled than Gurdip at making me feel better.\u201dRobbie snorts. \u201cSo I should hope.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d It\u2019s almost a purr. \u201cIn fact, I think I should move back in for a while, just so you\u2019re nearby in case I need more care and attention.\u201dRobbie runs his fingers lightly down James\u2019s side, smirking at the way James squirms away in response. The lad\u2019s ticklish, is he? That could be very useful information. \u201cSeem to remember I wasn\u2019t the one who wanted you to move out.\u201d\u201cTrue,\u201d James agrees. Robbie cants his hips, enjoying the reaction that gets from James as well. \u201cReckon I could find space for your crutches again, all right.\u201dJames leans up and starts to kiss Robbie deeply, and his hands repeat some of the more interesting things he\u2019d done to Robbie last night. They\u2019ll have to stop soon, of course; the alarm\u2019s going to go off and work beckons, as well as an unplanned, but definitely necessary, meeting with Innocent. But they\u2019ve got five minutes, and Robbie\u2019s not going to waste it \u2014 not one second of it.And, yes, for the second time in about as many months he\u2019s contemplating the loss of his sergeant, and this time permanently. But, unlike the previous time, he\u2019s not at all unhappy at the prospect. Far from it.Just as long as he doesn\u2019t end up with Blake again...\n\n"}}, "4040356": {"Series:": ",\u00ab ,Part 2 of the ,Oxford and the Doctor, series, \u00bb,", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Second Doctor", "Jamie (Doctor Who)", "Zoe Heriot", "Laura Hobson", "Hooper (Lewis)", "Original Characters", "guest characters from my Lewis case fic AU series", "Oxford - Character"], "Words:": "29585", "Title": "The wrong place, the wrong time", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Bookmarks:": "2", "Fandoms:": ["Doctor Who (1963)", "Lewis (TV)"], "Category:": ["M/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Hits:": "615", "Kudos:": "24", "Summary": "\nThe Doctor, Jamie and Zoe arrive in Oxford in the autumn of 2008.

It was early evening; and there was a chill nip in the air in the early autumn weather. A group of late tourists wandered past the turn and towards the bright lights of the main High Street. A man with a long black gown hurried by, wondering at it, as the wind picked up. The air was suddenly ripped apart by the weirdest of sounds, like a sort of wheezing, groaning noise. What kind of description is that, wondered the Fellow and he hurried on by, to his rooms, ready to enjoy another peaceful night before that rabble of students descended in another few weeks and Michaelmas began.*Julie sighed and gathered up her notes, glad that this was the last week of the TEFL job. Two weeks in the Greek sunshine beckoned before she was back to admin work with the new students up at Merton. She shivered. It was unseasonably cold for September; she really didn\u2019t fancy the long cycle home to Hinksey.\u00a0*Dave huffed against the cold as he took a short cut though the meadow. He was going to be late again. The manager of The Bear had warned him if he were late again he\u2019d be sacked, and he really needed this extra pub job, the cash came in handy since Louise could no longer work. When they\u2019d planned to start a family they had never dreamed she would end up on crutches and have to give up work months before the baby, too early for maternity pay.\u00a0*A group of schoolgirls in blue tartan skirts and blue blazers with red ties stumbled out of The Mission Burrito, giggling, stomachs fit to bursting with cheap burritos. One almost stumbled over a woman\u2019s\u2019 purple wheelchair and her daughter, in a maroon blazer, rolled her eyes and sighed. Why couldn\u2019t people look where they were going? The girl stuttered an apology, even though her shin throbbed with the bruise, and ran after her friends, towards the Bear and Oriel Square.*The man scowled and shrugged his jacket around him, then cupping his hands around the match, struck it and lit his cigarette. He inhaled deeply and stumbled, more than a little drunk, down Dead Man\u2019s Walk. It was surely safe by now? Why was he afraid, anyway, scummy hippies had no right to take what wasn\u2019t theirs!*\u201cWhat do you think then?\u201d Lewis asked, mouthful around his burrito.\u201cM\u2019mm,\u201d said Hathaway non-commitally. He prodded his burrito still wrapped in his foil.\u201cFast. Cheap. Yet healthy. My neighbour raves about this place all the time.\u201d\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d replied Hathaway, and looked up to see a schoolgirl in plaits and a maroon blazer staring at him. He grew uncomfortable under her unblinking gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t stare,\u201d hissed her mother, a scruffily dressed, harassed looking woman in a wheelchair.\u201cHe\u2019s wearing make-up,\u201d the girl said, with the kind of embarrassing loud certainly normally reserved for toddlers.Lewis snorted happily and sniggered, before reaching out for Hathaway\u2019s burrito. \u201cIf you\u2019re starving yourself, sergeant, I\u2019ll eat it.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Hathaway put a protective hand over his food, \u201cI just would have liked some coffee.\u201d*Linked arm in arm the four girls wandered down Dead Man\u2019s Walk, making spooky noises and giggling, startling a nervous looking man.\u201cHi Dave,\u201d said one of them, \u201chow\u2019s Lou?\u201d\u201cOh, um Katy is it? Trevor\u2019s kid? Yeah, she\u2019s doing okay, as long as she takes it easy.\u201d\u201cOh, give her my love, won\u2019t you.\u201d\u201cSure. Um, I\u2019m late for work..\u201d\u201cBye then.\u201d\u201cUm yeah, bye.\u201d The girls\u2019 shrieking laughter followed him. He had to give himself a little pep talk that they weren\u2019t laughing at him.That was weird. Art installation? He\u2019d thought it was one of those portaloos as he approached Merton but it was bigger, a darker blue, and wooden. He hurried around the object and on to work.*Five minutes before Dave had rushed past the strange object its door had opened and out had stepped a bright eyed, ridiculously dressed, man. His trousers were too short, his jacket, a frock coat, too big, his bow tie pinned on by a safety pin, his mop hair cut 40 years out of date. A much younger man in a kilt and a tight t-shirt and black jacket, who put a protective hand on the older, scruffier, man\u2019s shoulder, followed him. The two men turned to the open door, which bizarrely spilled an awful lot of bright light out of it, and beckoned to a dark haired young woman dressed in a silver cat suit with a matching Alice band. They both held out a hand and she stepped out and looked around.\u201cWhy, I do believe we\u2019re in Oxford,\u201d she said, sounding delighted, looking about as the older man locked the door of his strange box. \u201cBut when?\u201d\u201cAye, when Doctor? From what you\u2019ve said, we could be in my time, two hundred years before that or four hundred years after.\u201d\u201cOr more,\u201d added the girl.\u201cWell, judging from the pollution content, we have to be at least mid twentieth century, and certainly after 1967,\u201d he said, nodding his head towards the monstrous concrete block of Merton\u2019s Warden\u2019s quarters.The girl looked ahead. \u201cMy century,\u201d she said definitively, \u201cbut earlier. Look at that primitive MP3s those girls have.\u201dThe man called the Doctor peered up the gloomy lane at the gaggle of schoolgirls.\u201cWhat sharp eyes you have Zoe,\u201d he said. Zoe preened as if paid a compliment.*Ten minutes later, just as he reached The Bear, Dave turned on his heel, picking up the screams of distressed girls in the meadow far behind him, not the amused shrieking of earlier, but the terrified screams of distressed children.*Hathaway, too, heard the screaming, having left the Mission to have a cigarette, having given up his burrito to his boss and ordered a salad box to go instead. He popped his head around the restaurant door to inform Lewis before running towards the source of the screaming in long, leggy, strides. With a wistful glance to his second burrito and a quick wipe of his mouth with a serviette, Lewis followed his sergeant.He caught up with Hathaway at the entrance to Dead Man\u2019s Walk. A man was retching violently, doubled up. Hathaway had a gentle hand on the man\u2019s back. Just then Lewis\u2019 phone rang.\u201cLewis.\u201d He listened, as he was told that a young woman, in fact no more than a girl, had rung in to report a murder in the Merton entrance to Christchurch Meadow. Since his current car location was parked in Oriel Square \u2013 did he know that was illegal? \u2013 could he check it wasn\u2019t a hoax, as there appeared to be other shrieking girls in the background. Lewis informed them he was almost there and walked up the dark lane, passing an obsolete Police Box. What the hell was that antique doing there? At the other end of the lane, just before the kissing gates, he met the four girls who had been in the Mission as he and Hathaway had arrived. They were not screaming now, although two were sobbing, one shaking, and the last, as white as a sheet.\u201cAre you girls alright?\u201d he asked. They shrank away. He produced his warrant card. \u201cDetective Inspector Lewis,\u201d he said.\u201cWow, that was quick. We only just called,\u201d said the white faced but composed young lady.\u201cCoincidence, I was just in the Mission Burrito. So were you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s observant, I didn\u2019t notice you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my job to notice things. Besides, you all only had eyes for my sergeant.\u201dThe girls, despite their shock, dissolved into giggles.\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cHathaway! Don\u2019t go creeping up on people like that!\u201d\u201cSorry Sir. The retching man\u2019s name is Dave Manners, works in The Bear Friday and Saturday, and Cowley Works the rest of the week, as an accountant. He\u2019s also a lay vicar,\u201d he added, with some weird disapproval in his voice. \u201cHe heard the girls scream, knows one of the girls\u2019 dad apparently. Says they found a body. He went to investigate and well, his supper came up at the sight.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t see the body as such, just the blood. And then men, standing over.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Hathaway demanded as Lewis was already pushing through the kissing gates, pulling a torch from his pocket. Hathaway asked the girls and man to stay where they were and pulled out his phone, calling for backup, SOCOs, and a pathologist. He came up behind Lewis in time to see a dark haired man caught in the glare of the torch. His eyes glinted with some feverish look. He looked as if he\u2019d dressed at a jumble sale in the dark. Even tramps never looked so uncoordinated and scruffy. He stood up to his not too impressive height, straightening his pinned on bow tie.\u201cAh,\u201d he said, as he realised that his hands were bloodied and had now stained his tie and shirt. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d\u201cOch, Doctor, why does this always happen to us?\u201dHathaway saw a second man squatting at the foot of the body. He too stood up to his equally unimpressive height and Hathaway was surprised to see he was much younger and wearing a kilt, a rather short kilt showing rather lovely legs.\u201cYou found the body then?\u201d asked Lewis.\u201cUm, yes, as you can see,\u201d said the older, nameless, man. He was wiping his hands on a red spotted handkerchief he\u2019d pulled from his breast pocket.\u201cWe just found him \u2013 there,\u201d added the younger man, pointing to the hedge.\u201cYou moved him?\u201d Hathaway asked. The two men looked up at him.\u201cMy, but aren\u2019t you a tall young man. Isn\u2019t he tall, Jamie?\u201d\u201cAye, he is that. And as skinny as a wee bit a string.\u201d\u201cCould you answer the question please?\u201d\u201cHe was breathing, I was trying to save him. His throat has been ripped \u2013 not a clean cut, a rip.\u201d\u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d asked Lewis.\u201cI\u2019m the Doctor, actually. And this is my friend Jamie. And the young lady who... oh? Where did Zoe go?\u201d\u201cZoe?\u201d Lewis asked, feeling the entire conversation was getting out of his control. Just then Hathaway spoke behind him,\u201cSir, uniform have arrived.\u201d\u201cYes, go sort them James.\u201dHobson arrived soon after uniform, and the scene of crime moved in, although the murder scene had been somewhat like Piccadilly Circus, what with barmen accountant vicars, school girls, to say nothing of unaccountable, nameless tramps covered in blood and their kilt wearing companions. Lewis and Hathaway left uniform to take statements and pathology and forensics to do their thing and arrested the Doctor and Jamie.\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\nLewis sighed and rubbed his eyes. \u201cRight, let\u2019s start at the beginning again, shall we? What is your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you. The Doctor.\u201d\u201cSo you keep saying. Doctor what? It\u2019s a bloody title, not a name.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the only one I have to offer you.\u201d\u201cOkay. You and your friend...\u201d\u201cNow, he has a name you\u2019ll like, James Robert McCrimmon. And you like the name James, don\u2019t you Inspector. And of course, Robert is your own given name.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cI have explained, several times. I was trying to save his life. Why would I kill him? I\u2019ve only just arrived here in Oxford. I didn\u2019t know him.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Self defence? What were you and your friend doing, going for a walk in a dark meadow?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like the way you say friend Inspector.\u201d\u201cWell, what would you call him?\u201d\u201cJamie is indeed my friend and I call him Jamie, unsurprisingly enough. And we had literally arrived. We were exploring. Not uncommon in a tourist city, surely?\u201d\u201cFriend friend or boyfriend?\u201dThe Doctor smiled a smug smile. \u201cWhat is it with you humans of this era, always trying to categorise peoples\u2019 relationships. Married. Civil partnership. Living together. Separated. Single...\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you on about?\u201d\u201cNever mind Inspector.\u201dJust then there was a knock at the door and a young Asian woman in uniform entered, looking more than a little confused. She whispered in the Inspector\u2019s ear and then left. The Doctor watched the exchange with bright, curious eyes. He watched Lewis\u2019 strangely fair eyebrows disappear into his hairline and turn to look at him in a nervous fashion. After the young constable left Lewis sat back down, handing the piece of paper to the surely, older DC who had been keeping a silent vigil in the corner of the room. He took it from his boss, read it and swore under his breath, and stared intently at the Doctor. Lewis made a gesture at him with his hands; the Doctor presumed he was being told not to react.\u201cOkay,\u201d Lewis said after a deep breath. \u201cJames Robert McCrimmon is not on any computer record for anything. No national insurance or NHS. Nothing.\u201d\u201cNot surprisingly, he was born in the eighteenth century. No doubt the DNA sample you took from me has bounced back from the lab in a surprising hurry. Perhaps they thought it was someone fooling around?\u201d\u201cSort off. Not human, yeah...\u201d Lewis shook his head and visibly pulled himself together. \u201cUm. Not human,\u201d he repeated more firmly. \u201cCare to explain that?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d the man called the Doctor twisted his hands together, looking oddly bashful, \u201cI would have thought that was self-explanatory. My DNA shows I\u2019m not human because I am not. Human. I was born on another world, another time, Inspector. I travel. In time. And space.\u201d\u201cWith your eighteenth century toy boy?\u201d Lewis spat out archly.\u201cReally Inspector, that is uncalled for. What a horrid expression. And somewhat hypocritical considering all those thoughts you have for your sergeant, I would have thought. Jamie and I are close, very close, but that is surely our business?\u201d\u201cAye,\u201d Lewis agreed, rubbing his eyes. He looked up and sighed, running his fingers through his thinning hair. \u201cBut you were still found with the body with blood on your hands.\u201d\u201cI was trying to save his life Inspector, I have already explained that on several occasions!\u201dLewis sighed again and leaned back in his chair, glancing at Hooper who stood by the door. Hooper shrugged. \u201cAlright. Fine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou convince me that you had nothing to do with the murder and I\u2019ll let you go. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m meant to, I\u2019m sure there are people I should inform... Ah, hell. Right. Start from the beginning. You say you were trying to save his life. How exactly did you and your friend find this dying man?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit difficult to explain. We arrived in my time machine. Shall we call it that? I call it the TARDIS.\u201d\u201cTARDIS?\u201d Lewis interrupted; as if he were hearing something he once had heard of, long ago.\u201cYes. TARDIS. Time And Relative Dimension in Space. Mean anything to you, Inspector?\u201dA long ago soft voice tickled Lewis\u2019 memory \u2013 \u2018Please, say nothing to him when you meet a long time from now, when you an old inspector\u2019. It had been whispered into the young DC Lewis\u2019 ear so long ago... he shook his head to clear the memory and replied, \u201cNothing at all. Go on.\u201d\u201cWell, we had just stepped outside and were debating whether we were indeed in Oxford and \u2013 I take it this is Oxford?\u201d\u201cUm. Yes.\u201d\u201cAnd when...\u201d the Doctor paused and looked at Lewis expectantly.\u201cIt\u2019s the 10th of September 2008,\u201d Lewis supplied helpfully.\u201cAh. Zoe was right then. Zoe! Has anyone yet found my other friend?\u201d\u201cYou have a girlfriend as well?\u201d\u201cA friend Inspector. Zoe. Young woman, dressed in silver, dark hair?\u201dLewis looked at Hooper.\u201cI\u2019ll go see if we know anything boss... Sir!\u201d\u00a0*Meanwhile, Zoe was lost in the darkness of Christchurch meadow. She had almost slipped down an embankment into a river \u2013 the Cherwell or Isis she did not know, for she was as blind as a bat. The streetlights she could see to her right were a very long way off, and the spot lit colleges looked eerie and misty behind her, looking as if they might be over a mile away.She wished she had worn something with pockets, or had carried a bag, something to have a torch. Why didn\u2019t she think of these things? Give her an equation or a chemical solution she was happy, but the practicalities she was not too good at. Nor was the Doctor, she suspected. They relied on Jamie far too much really for all that.She did so hope the Doctor and Jamie had been able to save that man. She hoped too they had heard her, but she had long realised they hadn\u2019t, as Jamie would most definitely have come after her.She had chased the man, the thing!, into the growing darkness down the rest of Deadman\u2019s Walk and out into the open meadow and down towards the Cherwell, but had lost him. She had heard a splash and thought he might have jumped into the river, but she wasn\u2019t sure, he might have thrown something in to confuse her. It wasn\u2019t a very big splash, not the sort that such a big fiend might make. He had been very fast, she was far behind him by the time she had heard the splash. That was the first time she had nearly slipped. But that was hours ago, and the sky had turned from the deep purple-blue of twilight to the deepest black of night a long time ago. It was a full moon, but a very cloudy night, full of heavy clouds, and the moon was only occasionally barely visible through the thick coverage. To cap it all it began to rain, huge, wet, droplets, drenching her in seconds. She might have well have fallen into the river, either of them!Shivering and muttering under her breath about how she would give Jamie what-for for not following her to give chase of the culprit, she hugged herself tightly and turned back towards the eerily lit colleges of Christchurch, Merton and New, hoping not to meet anything on the way and that she would be able to find a way out. She supposed in absence of a better plan, she should find the TARDIS and wait. If only she had a key!\u00a0*\u00a0James Hathaway had received a copy of the same report from the same young woman PC. He did not quite know how to react. For a while, he held on to it in one hand, glancing at the report as if it might bite him, while he actually bit the side of his thumb continually on his other hand, leaning back and sideways onto the arm of his chair, staring at James McCrimmon across the desk.Eventually Jamie could take the silence and the staring no longer.\u201cWhat does that wee bit of paper say then? It had better say something the like we no did anything but tried to help that poor man!\u201d\u201cIt says you are on no data base. The assumption would normally be that you have given a false name, and had never had your fingerprints or DNA taken by us. Giving a false ID is a criminal offence.\u201dJamie frowned, trying to follow. Fingerprints he could guess at, and the Doctor had told him once the marking on the tips of everyone\u2019s fingers was unique to them in all of time and space, an amazing thing that was a beautiful as stars and nebulae. But as for all the gobbledygook the tall pretty man spouted... \u201cData what? My DN what? I am who I say I am. James Robert McCrimmon, Piper to the Clan McLaren. If you need to know this I was born in the Year of Our Lord 1724.\u201dHathaway stood up and threw the paper down on the table. \u201cRidiculous! That would make you over 300 years old! You barely look 30!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s coz I\u2019m not! I\u2019m no that old!\u201d he looked up at the sergeant, who looked angry and confused. Jamie had seen this reaction before, many times, so he said more calmly, \u201cAnd I\u2019m 24, or thereabouts. Travelling with the Doctor can make ye lose track of time.\u201dHathaway stared back at him, disbelieving, Jamie supposed.Jamie picked up the discarded report and struggled to make some sense of it. He could read fluently now, but so much of it was a list of numbers and such like, graphs and things too. Zoe and the Doctor\u2019s thing. He did figure out all the numbers, swiggles and charts were saying that the Doctor\u2019s blood was not remotely human before the sergeant snatched it away from him.\u201cI travel with the Doctor. In time and space. We can go anywhere. Well, in theory. We actually go where the TARDIS lands, the Doctor can\u2019t control it, she had a mind all of her own, the contrary beastie. We\u2019d just materialised in that wee, dark, lane and were arguing \u2013 well, the Doctor and Zoe were arguing whether we were in Oxford in the early twenty-first century...\u201d\u201cYou are,\u201d Hathaway said, sitting down again, looking close to tears of confusion. The Bible said nothing about time travel.\u201cWhere is Zoe anyway?\u201d Jamie suddenly demanded.\u00a0*Zoe was cold, wet, and miserable. Oxford did not appear to have changed \u2013 or will not change \u2013 in the next sixty years or so. The shops were different, mostly, of course, but she recognised some chains that would obviously survive the future troubles ahead. It had taken her over an hour to get out of Christchurch Meadow, she had had to climb over a high fence, carefully avoiding spikes, and stumbled her way down the dark and spooky Rose Lane next to the closed Botanic Garden. She had headed up the High, thinking she could find her way back to the TARDIS, which she reasoned, must be behind Merton. Merton was where she had attended two summer camp courses in advanced computing and quantum physics in her early teens as part of her Elite Programming. Merton was on of the few colleges to subscribe to the theory \u2013 most of Oxford and all of Cambridge has objected to such fast hot housing. It had, in fact, been, a few months of the most freedom in her entire childhood. She had always maintained a fondness for Oxford.However, she was not feeling particularly fond now. She was soaking wet and bedraggled and the many tourists out and about, looking for a restaurant to eat in, gave her a wide berth. She was shocked, too, by the number of rough sleepers she saw in shop doorways and the arches leading to the Covered Market. She was horrified to think that these tourists thought she too might be a beggar or a tramp.She located Magpie Lane, which took her to Merton Street and she hoped to go on to Deadman\u2019s Lane and the TARDIS, but the approach was roped off with bright yellow tape emblazoned with \u2018police\u2019, and several police cars with their bright yellow and blue battenburg colouring. The police aircars of her time still had the same colouring in Central City. She hurriedly stepped back, not wishing to draw attention to herself. Down the lane, beyond the TARDIS, she could see a white tent had been erected over the site of where she, the Doctor and Jamie had found the dying man. She turned back the way she came, not having a clue what to do or how to find the Doctor or Jamie. She had no money or credit, nowhere to go, and no one to turn to. She felt so alone. Perhaps she should go back, talk to the police, tell them what she had seen, that she had chased the murderer or attacker at the very least, but the police security and forensics tent made her think it likely he had died. They might even know where the Doctor was \u2013 he was probably helping them solve it by now, if she knew him.Unless they had arrested him? That happened a lot too.Oh dear. What to do...\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\nLewis popped his head around the office door about an hour after Hathaway had assumed he had left,\u201cCome on then, if you must work all night, let\u2019s do it at mine.\u201d\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d still be here Sir, much less that I intended to stay?\u201d\u201cBecause I know you, soft lad, and I\u2019m a not too bad detective myself.\u201d Lewis looked at all the witness statements and transcripts of the interviews with family and friends of the victim that the DCs and Plods had collated. \u201cBring all that. We can pick up a curry and a few bottles of beer on the way to mine. Might as well be comfortable going through it all.\u201d\u201cSir,\u201d Hathaway replied, standing and taking his jacket off the back of his chair, following Lewis out with the sheaves of paper hurriedly stuffed in a couple of document wallets.\u00a0*\u00a0Jamie was pacing angrily, looking for weaknesses in the cell he was locked in. It was as tight as a drum, and if he escaped, the door led to a corridor with another locked door behind that and then some guards. On top of that he had spotted no less than six of those eye things on the wall, the type that guards would watch at from a distance. He had never seen so many before, it surprised him that such future fellow humans would use intrusive technology. But he\u2019d learn long ago that humans could be as bad as Daleks, or maybe long before he knew that, at Culloden, before he had ever met the Daleks or Cybermen and the like. The English, anyway, and he was definitely in the heart of England right now.He sighed heavily and sat down on the wee bunk bed. In was no bad as cells went, it was warm and dry, with bedding on the bunk and a flushable toilet in the corner, no bucket or nothing primitive or demeaning. He had long ago learnt to appreciate any technology that was clean, hygienic and comfortable. He had no desire to ever return to the eighteenth century\u2019s living standards. An hour since he had been brought supper, and it had been edible, meat in a sauce, mash and green peas. He had not even considered rushing the guard who brought it. Everything was far too secure and tight. He guessed he would just have to rely on the Doctor to get them out of this one.\u00a0*\u00a0\u201cRight then,\u201d Lewis said, switching off the television and reaching for the folders, feeling replete. He looked up at Hathaway, who was just returning from his boss\u2019 kitchen after clearing the remains of their curry and beers away, bring a pot of tea. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look then. What had you made of it so far, you always look for patterns?\u201d\u201cA strange sound and a sudden wind that blew up and disappeared in a hurry about fifteen minutes or so before the schoolgirls found the body. Several sighting of him before that.\u201d\u201cOkay. But first, with all that weird stuff with the Doctor \u2013 what the hell is that supposed to mean, it\u2019s not a name! And this boy, Jamie! I\u2019ve not had time for procedure.\u201d\u201cAnd is there procedure for people who turn up with alien DNA or claiming to be born in the eighteenth century?\u201d asked Hathaway archly.\u201cAye. As it happens, there is. Innocent has filed a report to some covert quasi-military group, part of the UN I think. She should get a reply in the morning about what we\u2019re to do. And you logged it didn\u2019t you, on the system, like I asked?\u201dHathaway looked slightly sick and uncomfortable, but nodded.\u201cBut enough of that,\u201d Lewis said hurriedly, appreciating that maybe his devout and strict Catholic sergeant wasn\u2019t comfortable with aliens or time travel. He wasn\u2019t sure he was, either, not really, but he hoped he was open minded enough to accept the forensic evidence he\u2019d been given. \u201cTell us about our victim.\u201d\u201cAlan Marsh. 32. Former hod carrier and labourer. Officially unemployed. Record for petty theft, affray and possession. Believed to be in the employ of a loan shark and slum landlord, so Peterson tells me. Was last seen in Merton Street about twenty to thirty minutes before his body was found. He was actually known by several of the witnesses to his movements prior to his death. PM tomorrow morning first thing, but according to Dr. Hobson\u2019s initial examination, the throat appears to have been ripped open by something resembling a claw or huge teeth \u2013 she thinks possibly a gardening implement, but she\u2019ll have more details after her PM. SOCO found nothing at the scene, no weapon, no footprints except those of perhaps a large dog -\u201d\u201cCould a dog have done it? You know, a dangerous dog, popular weapon with certain types of low life thug. If he\u2019s being watched by Peterson\u2019s team...?\u201d\u201cFootprints too big for a pitbull of something similar. Like an Alsatian but far bigger, according to the report.\u201d\u201cLike the bloody Hound of the Baskervilles, you mean?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not speculate Sir. Shall we go through the witness statement now Sir?\u201d Lewis heard the please, even though Hathaway didn\u2019t say it.\u00a0*\u00a0Meanwhile the Doctor sat cross-legged on the floor, playing his recorder, which miraculously he had been allowed to keep, even though they had taken his shoelaces and bow tie. Unfortunately they had taken his sonic screwdriver, they had no idea what it was, of course, but believed he could do damage to himself or an officer with it, obviously. It had been rather amusing really, to watch the custody sergeant\u2019s eyes widen at the ever increasingly surprise she struggled vainly to hide. His pockets held so much. Come to think of it, everything else had been taken and put in three large lidded plastic boxes. His recorder had been in his boot, and by that time he suspected the young custody sergeant had had enough and when he argued that music kept him calm she gave in without a fuss. He wasn\u2019t sure what else it was good for, could a recorder be a sonic tool too? No, it would interfere with the harmonies. He hoped at least Jamie could hear him play and feel a bit calmer. If he hadn\u2019t intervened Jamie would have hit one of the officers, the tall, thin sergeant, the young brown skinned policemen or the fat, old custody officer. Not the custody sergeant, of course, Jamie was an old fashioned boy with romantic feelings of chivalry and old-fashioned ideas in his heart. He did not approve of women in such roles, although he politely kept it to himself, the Doctor knew. Just like he knew Jamie still missed poor little Victoria and struggled to understand bright young Zoe.The Doctor realised his cheerful ditty had turned quite melancholy. He put down the recorder and sighed. He and Jamie were innocent, that murder was unearthly, even evil, and he had great faith in early twenty-first century British police procedure and its forensic and evidence approach coupled with Habeas Corpus, so had no doubt not only would he and Jamie be soon released, but also had no doubt that Inspector Lewis would ask for his help. Touched by artron energy, that one, but he had no intention of finding out more. He had a feeling the man lay in his future, not his past. He was sure had been to this police station once before, however, but couldn\u2019t remember. Well, when one was over four hundred and fifty, the mind was bound to delete things...\u00a0*\u00a0Inspector Lewis had no such ideas of unearthly or evil murder in his head, well; none more than any murder was evil and foul. But Robbie Lewis had seen many forms of murder, and the best way to go was to look for motive, means and opportunity \u2013 monsters did not form part of that equation. He was currently sat in the centre of his sofa, legs spread, very much the alpha male taking up all the space, unconcerned that his long legged, young, sergeant was squashed up to one side of him. Well, unconcerned yes, unaware, no, he felt the heat of that strong thigh pressing into his all the while his sergeant went through the witness and contacts of the victims, filing details away for future examination.Anton Milyutin, a Russian sociology Professor and Fellow of Keble had rooms in Merton Street and had seen Alan about half an hour before his body had been found, walking along Merton Street from the Warden Lodge\u2019s end, staggering, very much the worse for wear with drink. Soon after they passed Milyutin reported hearing a strange sound, like an electronic herd of trumpeting elephants and felt a sudden strong gust of stormy wind, but both the blowing and the noise had died down within seconds. He had turned back and seen Marsh turn down the lane to enter the Meadow by the side of Merton College. DC Mercer had noted that the professor had let it slip that he had recognised and knew Marsh but had then tried to deny it. She had pressed but could get no more information out of him.\u201cIt might mean nothing, but...\u201d Hathaway concluded.\u201cAye. Why would a young college Fellow, a foreign one, know a local labourer and maybe thug, eh? What secrets does this Professor Milytin... Milutin...?\u201d\u201cMilyutin Sir.\u201d\u201cYeah, him. What does he hide? Where would he go to meet him? The Oxford Castle Inn maybe? The Jolly Farmers?\u201dHathaway shrugged almost imperceptibly after a barely there scowl marred his face for a few moments, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to hide, is it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Lewis said pointedly. He sighed and rubbed his face. \u201cOkay, we need to speak to him, uncover how he knows him, whether he had a motive. Has Merton Street been searched for a murder weapon?\u201d\u201cSOCO have closed off the meadow and the surrounding streets to the Dead Man Walk entrances, but they are waiting for first light for a full search Sir.\u201d\u201cOf course they are. Right, who\u2019s next?\u201d\u201cEr. Yes.\u201d Hathaway fumbled through his notes on the coffee table, leaning forward, brushing against Lewis\u2019 thigh perhaps more than he needed. The Doctor\u2019s cryptic comment came back to Lewis for a moment. He sighed and pulled his legs together, breaking the warm contact. The lad was so young, and who knew what his preferences were, if indeed he had any at all, he claimed to be celibate. He suspected a gay devout Catholic was more likely to be celibate that a straight one, but what did he know? Right now that acceptance of Catholic teaching seemed to be making him uncomfortable with the Doctor\u2019s blood work and DNA (Innocent had insisted on full bloods after the DNA swab came back \u2018not even remotely human\u2019!).\u201cJulie Teale,\u201d Hathaway continued after consulting his notes. \u201cCurrently on a temporary contract with Merton\u2019s summer English courses, but also has a part-time job as their library secretary. She also apparently assists with Freshers\u2019 week admin and seems to have several very part time roles within the college admin. She failed to go down from Merton herself, apparently having a baby in her final year...\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t she go back?\u201dHathaway gave his boss a look.\u201cAye, well this is Oxford I suppose, not Newcastle Poly. Go on then.\u201d\u201cShe corroborates Milyutin\u2019s sightings and times of Marsh, as well as also describes hearing a, and I quote...\u201d Hathaway\u2019s voice dripped with sarcasm, \u201c... an \u2018electronic wheezing and groaning sort of noise\u2019 at the same time a sudden gust of wind nearly made her lose the paperwork she had been carrying from the college...\u201d\u201cYou know, this noise and wind is giving the Doctor his alibi \u2013 it\u2019s no doubt his time machine arriving. We saw it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat old 1950s police box. It\u2019s his, what did he call it...? TARDIS.\u201d\u201cSir,\u201d Hathaway said flatly, his face inscrutable. \u201cI know he\u2019s locked up, it\u2019s procedure, but do we have anything on him, whereas...\u201d\u201cWhereas what sergeant?\u201d Lewis snapped. The paperwork on an alien being the murderer must be awful; he began to think, although he wasn\u2019t sure, although he had been caught literally red-handed. But where was the weapon then? The man \u2013 for want of a better word! \u2013 had had his copious pockets searched, and although the young Scot had a dirk in his boot, there was not a scrap of blood, even under ultraviolet. Clean as a whistle, the pair of them.So caught up in his wonderings about the alien and his eighteenth century toy boy Lewis almost missed something important, something that was a proper police matter.\u201cJulie Teale is Alan Marsh\u2019s ex. In fact, he is the father of her child, a three-year-old boy. She\u2019s, quote, \u2018getting over him, rebuilding her life, doesn\u2019t need this shit, although is not sorry he\u2019s dead. Why can\u2019t he stop ruining her life!\u2019\u201d\u201cInteresting. She said she saw him enter Christchurch Meadow?\u201d\u201cShe pulled back into Merton\u2019s doorway, he didn\u2019t see her, and if he did he would have made quite a scene, according to her. DC Hooper chased down a string of complains regarding domestic violence from three years back. He was arrested and detained a few times, cautioned and released. She has a restraining order and moved addresses, denies him access of the child for whom he pays no maintenance.\u201d\u201cAnyone new in her life?\u201d\u201cShe says not. Hooper got the impression she was afraid to, that she wouldn\u2019t feel safe, that he would find her somehow.\u201d\u201cA motive then, maybe?\u201d\u201cPlus opportunity and no alibi. Milyutin didn\u2019t see her, or any of our other witnesses.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll bring her in for questioning in the morning. We\u2019ll get Julie to do it, she\u2019ll more likely feel comfortable with a woman, giving her past experience.\u201dHathaway made a note, leaning forward again to the coffee table. Lewis didn\u2019t mean to but found himself glancing at his sergeant\u2019s trim backside as he did so.\u00a0*DC Stephanie Andrews loved nights. It made childcare easier. Her husband came home from work, they had tea, she bathed the kids and put them to bed and then came to work in a quiet, shut up station, dealing with actions and data entry the rest of the team, with their other, more \u2018real\u2019 policing actions, didn\u2019t have time to do. Tonight, while she inputted all the path. and forensics report of the murder in Deadman\u2019s Walk \u2013 a death in Deadman\u2019s, it amused her! \u2013 she noticed something strange flashing for attention on the HOLMES 2 entry for the case, named Indigo \u2013 weirder that is than the injuries she was already double entering, and they were strange. Some sort of gardening implement, no doubt, she supposed. Not real claws and teeth, it couldn\u2019t be, could it...?There was a tag for eyes of Chief Superintendent rank and above only, just inputted somewhere else, responding to the data on the suspect currently in the holding cells downstairs. She wondered whether she should bother the Chief? Innocent wouldn\u2019t be best pleased, to be awoken at gone midnight, she supposed...\u00a0*Lewis yawned and stretched, lifting his arms high, not noticing his sergeant had to duck his head and lean slightly to his left to avoid being smacked in the side of his head.\u201cLook at the time? Is there much more? We don\u2019t get paid for all these hours, maybe we should call it a day?\u201dHathaway was yawning too; Lewis\u2019 yawns were always infectious.  \u201cThere\u2019s only one more witness statement to go Sir. The schoolgirls will be statemented in the morning, with an appropriate adult with them. The best thing was to get their parents to fetch them and get them home with the number of Victims Support. Traumatic for them, finding the body...\u201d\u201cYeah. I suppose. Poor kids. I had my head full of the Doctor and the blood, I forgot about them. About fourteen weren\u2019t they? Poor lasses.\u201d\u201cDC Mercer looked after them until their families could be traced and arrive. Merton\u2019s Porter was good enough to let them wait in his lodge.\u201d\u201cNice of him. Tea?\u201d\u201cUm. Yeah. That would be nice Sir.\u201dLewis stood and headed for the kitchenette, turning to look at his lanky sergeant, who had definite dark smudges about the eyes and had so over-reacted in a very Hathaway under-reacted, hidden, but deep down terrified way, to having an alien in custody. \u201cTell you what lad, you look shattered. I\u2019ll get the spare quilt and a pillow and you can crash on my sofa.\u201d\u201cThank you Sir, but...\u201d Before Hathaway could think of an excuse to go home to his own flat and not sleep Lewis interrupted with, \u201cIt\u2019s an order. You need to sleep and I know you. Come and tell me about this last witness while I make us some tea.\u201dHathaway arranged himself elegantly against the breakfast bar, looking for all the world like a model for GQ in his smart suit, with his slightly loosened tie and his blond short hair, and went through the document cases until he found the right paperwork.\u201cReverend David Manners \u2013 or Rev David - call me Dave - Manners as Hooper has written here. An unstipended Anglican minister, an accountant at the BMW plant and also works part time at The Bear...\u201d\u201cWait a minute. He\u2019s a vicar?\u201d\u201cYes. Unstipended means unsalaried, he supports the parish priest, is fully ordained, but also works within the community.\u201d\u201cIs this a religious thing, like those Friars, or a money saving thing on the side of the C of E?\u201d\u201cBit of both Sir. He is struggling financially too, hence the second job. His wife is pregnant and too ill to work, he told Hooper,\u201d Hathaway replied, scanning the detailed notes of the Statement Hooper had taken. Really, these should have been typed up and entered in the PNC and HOLMES 2 already, and then he wouldn\u2019t have had to deal with the spidery writing of Hooper. Still, they were all on overtime right from the actual murder. Tomorrow \u2013 today! \u2013 would do.\u201cOkay. I remember him. He threw up after seeing the body.\u201d\u201cYes. He had passed the girls on his way to work, nearly got there but turned around when he heard them scream. We arrived virtually at the same time. I heard the girls scream too, remember?\u201d\u201cAye. You\u2019d gone out for a fag.\u201d\u201cHe saw the victim about twenty minutes before he saw the girls, walking the opposite way, towards the Isis and Cherwell, he had come across from Abingdon Road on the river path. He saw no one else alone, but also saw a group of Chinese tourists and another of language school students with clipboards, writing down words like \u2018tree\u2019 and \u2018leaf\u2019. He stopped to talk to three, allowed them to practice their English.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s a priest and we\u2019re not, he has patience with those hordes of language school kiddies,\u201d Robbie said with heavy irony.Hathaway gave him a glare, \u201cI do not remember intolerance to young language school children with matching backpacks being discussed when I left the Seminary Sir.\u201d\u201cWhat was then?\u201d It was out of Lewis\u2019 mouth before he could stop himself. He\u2019d temporarily forgotten his sergeant\u2019s history even as he was worrying about his beliefs compromising this case.\u201cNot. That.\u201d Hathaway looked down, scanning Hooper\u2019s scrawl for anything else pertinent and important.Lewis touched Hathaway briefly on the arm before placing his mug of tea on the counter next to the files. \u201cAh, let\u2019s call it a day bonny lad. We\u2019re tired. The fact that he saw our victim going in the opposite direction is interesting; it means he turned back, for some reason. He was seen in Merton Street ten minutes before \u2013 he should have passed the girls, we\u2019ll find out in the morning. Wonder what he was up to, where he was going. Have we found a relative to ID him yet?\u201dHathaway shook his head while he picked up his mug and took a sip of tea, still looking intently at Hooper\u2019s notes. He scowled,\u201cThis is odd Sir. Reverend Manners reports hearing a low growl, like a large dog, just before he passed Marsh, and again, maybe in the bushes alone the Cherwell, but as he then heard a very strange noise \u2013 presumably the Doctor\u2019s vehicle,\u201d Hathaway finished with difficulty.Lewis couldn\u2019t help himself, he found his hand between Hathaway\u2019s shoulder blades before he thought about it, rubbing gently, \u201cThe Hound of Christchurch, eh? Or the Beast of the Cherwell?\u201d he huffed a gentle laugh. \u201cI know what Hobson said about the injuries, but really...\u201d\u201cAnd the Doctor,\u201d Hathaway added quietly, looking into his boss\u2019 eyes.Hell! Catholics believed in demons and that. Werewolves too, no doubt. And, in fact, hell...He suppressed a shudder. Ripped, torn and bitten, both the Doctor and Hobson had said about Marsh\u2019s throat.\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\nThe cell door was flung open first thing by an angry looking Inspector Lewis.\u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d he snapped.The Doctor, still cross-legged upon the floor, stood and smiled.\u201cThank you Inspector Lewis. I take it my friend is also to be released?\u201d\u201cYes. And we\u2019ve found your other friend; Zoe Heriot is it? Another one not on our records, although she informed one of my constables she is yet to be born. He found the lass shivering in a shop doorway being hassled by a mentally ill, drunken, homeless lad and brought her in to dry off. She actually claims to have seen the murderer and is going to talk to us in a while. You can wait if you want, and maybe...\u201d Lewis looked at his shoes, looking like a much younger man. The Doctor thought he was probably quite remarkably good looking as a younger man. And more cheerful. Some great sorrow hung about this man\u2019s shoulders, he decided, and did not deserve a teasing.\u201cPerhaps there are one or two points you might like me to help with Inspector, one or two matters not covered by regular police procedure?\u201dLewis looked up again and rubbed in eye and then back of his neck before he sighed, \u201cAye,\u201d he breathed out. \u201cIf you would...\u201dLewis hadn\u2019t liked to ask but he had been summoned at eight that morning by Chief Superintendent Innocent to be informed that they had received a memo from UNIT, that semi official, mostly secret organisation that police officers liked to pretend didn\u2019t exist unless they were forced otherwise. Not only had Innocent received instructions to immediately release the Doctor and his companion, but to ask for his assistance if the murder in anyway did not seem the normal type, if any evidence, however small, pointed to something unearthly, unexplained, or \u2018magical\u2019 \u2013 the exact word used, magical! Innocent had not been happy, he was not happy, Hathaway had looked positively sick when he told him, but Hooper seemed quite cheerful about it, damn him. He was currently in the canteen with the young Miss Heriot, she who was apparently about minus fifty years old!Hooper himself had not been able to sleep that night either. The Doctor\u2019s DNA and blood work was just too exciting, the idea of time travel amazing. It was as if parts of his brain long since put to sleep when he was a small boy were being awakened. The thing he found most confusing was the fact that the boss and the sarge were normally the most kind, gentle, and compassionate of officers, something hard to maintain in a Serious Crime Unit, but both seemed to keep their humanity intact to a greater degree than others he had worked for. Why then were neither of them focusing on the fact that the Doctor and Jamie McCrimmon were both concerned for their young friend, a young woman barely out of her teens, wandering around a strange town, possibly in a strange time or even on a strange planet. It wasn\u2019t right.So he had got out of bed, got dressed, and driven about the city centre, and it hadn\u2019t taken him long to spot the trouble. True, it could have been a bit of argy between two rough sleepers, in which case it really was down to Uniform, but nevertheless, he had got out of his car and walked up the tailors on the corner of St Edmund\u2019s and the High and found a very young woman dressed in an expensive silver catsuit sitting huddled up in the stop doorway step being shouted at by one of the more well known homeless schizophrenics; the Mushroom Jesus as he called himself.At first young Zoe had seemed equally afraid of him, but once he showed her his warrant card and asked if she were a friend of the Doctor\u2019s she relaxed immediately. Not wanting to take her to the station and have her locked up after her ordeal, he took her home where Mrs Hooper fussed over her, fed her, and gave her a shower, dry clothes to sleep in while her own were dried, a warm bed and hot chocolate. His wife did miss their daughter Molly; that was certain.It proved to be a good move, as at breakfast, young Zoe had told him of seeing a wild looking man, more beast really, bend over the injured man, sort of gnawing at his throat and growling. She had screamed in horror and the Doctor and Jamie had come running, but she had given chase, thinking Jamie would come too while the Doctor tried to save the poor victim, but he obviously hadn\u2019t. She had been horrified to hear that the Doctor and Jamie had been accused and arrested as the poor man\u2019s attackers and was more than happy to give a statement immediately.Of course, once he heard, the boss wanted to interview her himself. He would. DCs just shifted through all the shit and the DI took all the interesting actions, and the credit of course, it was forever thus!\u00a0*Lewis and Hathaway stood at the scene of crime, staring at the SOCO team\u2019s markers, pointing out splashes of blood, footprints and paw prints \u2013 and they were indeed the size of some enormous hound, or perhaps even a wolf, but it would have to be the size of an adult man, they both reasoned but did not say out aloud to one another, although a shared, worried, look, communicated enough between the two men anyway.Lewis sighed, \u201cAh, enough of this. We should focus on procedure and not get carried away by all this nonsense,\u201d he said, not noticing the three strange travellers re-emerge from their \u2018TARDIS\u2019.\u201cAnd what nonsense do you mean Inspector?\u201dLewis and Hathaway turned and looked down on the strange man. He had put on a clean shirt and bow tie, yet again pinned on by a safety pin. Jamie had discarded his black tee shirt and jacket that had also been blood stained, for an old-fashioned looking shirt with ties instead of buttons. Over this he wore a sheepskin jerkin. He stood behind the Doctor, and slightly to the right of him, a protective guard, man at arms, lover. Lewis noticed the dirk back in the boot, and almost decided to point out it was illegal to carry such arms here and now, but gave it up as a bad job.\u201cAnimals. Monsters. Throats ripped. Let\u2019s work on what we have. Evidence. Forensics and witnesses. Your Zoe saw a man.\u201d\u201cWell, at first I thought it might have been a big dog, or a wolf, in the twilight,\u201d Zoe said, coming out of the TARDIS and closing the door carefully as she spoke. She had too changed, and was wearing a very short tunic dress in pink and green panels over green tights. She had a shoulder bag too, in pink leather, which matched her knee high pink boots.\u201cA man, you said,\u201d Lewis said pointedly.\u201cHe looked at me, when I screamed, his face seemed all furry and at first I thought he had a snout and large ears, like a dog, but as he got up and ran it seemed more like an unkempt beard and long hair. He did snarl at me and then he ran.\u201d\u201cNaked, you said,\u201d Hathaway prompted.Zoe nodded.\u201cShow me which way he ran,\u201d asked Hathaway.Zoe looked to the Doctor, who nodded and smiled. \u201cShow the sergeant, Zoe. Then you can get off, if you would still like to.\u201d The Doctor looked up at the tall Hathaway. \u201cI said Zoe might go to the Bodlian for the day, and study. Perhaps the Museum of Science or the Ashmolean? You won\u2019t need her after this?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s given her statement. What sort of academic study interests you Miss Heriot?\u201d Hathaway asked as the two of them walked off down the lane, Zoe leading the way. The Doctor, Jamie and Lewis watched them follow the route Zoe had chased the murderer.While she did so and Hathaway contacted uniform to section of the area and SOCO to make a further forensic search once they had finished in Merton Street and Deadman\u2019s Lane, Lewis and the Doctor looked more at the scene where Marsh had died, the Doctor again explaining how he had found him, the state of his injuries. As they discussed this Jamie said quietly, in the background,\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a full moon last night, was it?\u201dThe Doctor turned. \u201cInspector Lewis is right, Jamie, we must proceed scientifically. We can\u2019t rule out lycanthropy, and despite common myths, a full moon is not always required, depending on the type of lycanthropy we are dealing with. There may well be a normal motive and murder here, as the good Inspector and his tall sergeant wish for. Perhaps there was a murderer and a dog, a dog trained to kill...\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with dogs used as a murder weapon before,\u201d Lewis added. He did not, however, confirm that it had indeed been a full moon, or close to it, the night before.\u201cOr a mad person, living wild. Zoe said he was unkempt, dirty and naked. Or she thinks he was. Considering she chased him for nearly an hour she is not very sure, is she? And that in itself is mystifying.\u201d The Doctor turned to Lewis, \u201cZoe comes from a time when the bright and the best of children are taken away and their intelligence trained. She is highly observant and has an almost photographic memory...\u201d\u201cAye, I know the type,\u201d Lewis butted in, looking fondly towards where his sergeant and Zoe were. Zoe was pointing towards the Cherwell.\u201cAnd also she has limited imagination, which might explain why she was so confused by what she saw.\u201d\u201cYou mean she saw a werewolf and it doesn\u2019t fit in her view of the universe or the like?\u201d Jamie asked sharply. The Doctor gave him an annoyed look and sighed,\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s very helpful to use words like that Jamie,\u201d he said, with a glance to Inspector Lewis, who had squatted down to get a better look at the paw prints.\u201cBut you do sense evil Doctor, don\u2019t you?\u201dThe Doctor glanced again at Lewis to check he wasn\u2019t looking and nodded slowly, and then said hurriedly, \u201cNot evil exactly Jamie, but something is very wrong, a rip in time, I can feel it, as well as confusion, desperation, and violence. If we don\u2019t find the source very quickly all of Oxford might be in danger.\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0Lewis quickly took control again, insisting that the Doctor was with him as a specialist consultant, but nevertheless, they would proceed as modern police procedure dictated until evidence that simply couldn\u2019t be handled by normal Thames Valley CID SCU actions. But he kept the Doctor where he could see him, along side for all interviews. Jamie came with the Doctor, of course, and Hathaway followed his inspector like a loyal puppy dog, as Jamie pointed out to the Doctor,\u201cThe skinny lad has got it bad for his boss, hasn\u2019t he Doctor?\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t gossip Jamie, but yes, the poor boy is head over heels in love isn\u2019t he? Shame Inspector Lewis doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u201cShall we give them a wee push then?\u201d\u201cJamie! It\u2019s not our place to interfere!\u201d\u201cSeems to me you do nothing but interfere Doctor.\u201d\u201cNot in matters of love. But if you might drop a hint or two Jamie, well, what can I do?\u201d The Doctor turned and gave Jamie his most impish smile, the one that could turn Jamie\u2019s insides to water. He smiled back,\u201cAye, if you say so...\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0Professor Anton Milyutin was nervous to have the police back again, especially such senior officers.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about Professor,\u201d Lewis reassured. \u201cIt\u2019s just one or two points that need going over again, plus a couple of new questions.\u201d\u201cAnd it takes four of you?\u201d Milyutin asked, staring at the four men on his doorstep, an attractive tall man in a smart suit was something to be expected, the inspector\u2019s sergeant no doubt, and unexpected welcome eye candy on top. But the older man with the strange, dated, heavy fringed hair dressed as a tramp or a clown along with the very attractive younger man wearing a kilt, now that was very odd. It confused him so much he didn\u2019t know what he was feeling.\u201cThis is the Doctor and his assistant Mr McCrimmon. They\u2019re from UNIT, consulting Thames Valley Police on this case.\u201dAnton shuddered. He wondered if they might be there to do with the strange noise he had heard. He had heard of UNIT in Russia, they had dealt with the strange crash on his uncle\u2019s farm when he had been a boy.\u201cCome in. Would you like some tea? Or something stronger?\u201dMilyutin\u2019s rooms were in half of a cottage at the bottom end of Merton Street, the cottage was painted pink and Georgian, quite new for the street. It had been clumsily split in half, giving a tiny living room and kitchenette, with a tacked on bathroom extension built sometime in the nineteen sixties extending into the garden. The narrowest of staircase\u2019s led to his study and bedroom. Anton pointed up the stairs, explaining the living room was really too tiny for the five of them. He went into the kitchen. Hathaway followed to offer help, and, of course, size him up.While they waited for the kettle to boil Anton fiddled, looking nervously out of the tiny window that looked down the side of the bathroom into the teeniest of gardens.\u201cIs it about the strange noise?\u201d he blurted out.\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you,\u201d Hathaway said, \u201cbut we do know about the noise.\u201d\u201cDo you think I should make English tea?\u201d\u201cHow about both?\u201d Hathaway said, eyeing a rather splendid samovar. \u201cI drink my tea black sometimes, and I\u2019d love to try Russian tea. But as for my boss,\u201d he shrugged slightly and his lips twitched the barest of smiles for the smallest moment of time. But his pale eyes were quite warm for a moment. Anton had to look up to the sergeant, which was rare for him, as at six one, he was used to people around him looking up. Especially considering most of his students were young women!\u201cFine. I\u2019ve heard of UNIT you know,\u201d Anton said as he made tea. \u201cThe ones in Russia.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re ahead of me,\u201d Hathaway said acerbically. \u201cI only heard about then three hours ago.\u201d\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d\u201cDid you know the victim?\u201dAnton sighed and pulled up the only stool at the tiny breakfast bar and sat. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI met him at Baby Love.\u201d\u201cBaby Love, the disco at The Castle Tavern?\u201dAnton sighed again. He supposed a policeman might know where he meant straight away; then again, Hathaway was very well groomed, wearing even foundation and mascara. He nodded, commenting mildly, \u201cDisco is a rather old fashioned way of describing it Sergeant,\u201d before deciding on the truth and admitting, \u201cI was very drunk, I\u2019d had a bad time with my second thesis... My research takes me often into the dark underbelly of society and I was depressed.\u201d\u201cYou slept with him?\u201dAnton nodded. \u201cIt was a mistake. He is \u2013 was \u2013 bisexual, with a string of girlfriends and children, and can be quite violent. He has a temper. But that wasn\u2019t my regret.\u201d\u201cWhat then?\u201d\u201cHe works outside the law, have you found that out?\u201dHathaway shook his head, no point confirming anything, this way they could get more information, \u201cI think my inspector should hear this,\u201d he said in said, picking up the tray of samovar, teapot, tea glasses, cups, saucers, milk and sugar.\u00a0*\u00a0As they all sat on the eclectic mix of chairs set out for tutorials in his office, Milyutin explained all he knew about Marsh. He worked sometimes for a man called Initiaz Gulum, a successful businessman with fingers in many pies, both legitimate and illegitimate. He was a building contractor, student and slum landlord throughout East and South Oxford, and also had massage parlours and strip clubs.\u201cNot exactly your devout Muslim then,\u201d Lewis said sarcastically. Hathaway rolled his eyes at him.  \u201cWhat exactly did Mr Marsh do for Mr Gulum?\u201d the Doctor, who had up to this point been silent, alternatively drinking from his tea glass and his cup of tea, as he had been unable to chose which type of tea, asked quietly.\u201cWell, I think he started as a builder on one of his sites out on Greater Leys, but soon he was... sorry, I don\u2019t know the English? But doing the threats, the violence, evicting tenants illegally so the flats could be redone for a higher market, keeping his girls \u2013 by that I mean, prostitutes \u2013 in line.\u201dLewis nodded. He has already begun to suspect as much. \u201cAn enforcer.\u201d\u201cEnforcer?\u201d repeated Anton, seemingly delighted.\u201cHeavy. Thug. There are many professor,\u201d the Doctor said happily. \u201cEnglish is such a vivid, vibrant language. But might I ask, since you knew him, how did he seem, when you saw him before he was killed.\u201d\u201cHe was drunk, but that was nothing new. He seemed a little afraid, I think, but I have never seen him afraid before, so I am not sure. And angry. He barged past me, didn\u2019t acknowledge me, so I assumed he was busy, something work related, he never wanted anyone to know he had boyfriends as well as girlfriends...\u201d Anton looked away, realising he had confessed to more than a one night stand with a man he knew to be unfaithful and cruel. It did not paint him in a good light.\u201cAfraid and angry, you say,\u201d the Doctor asked as Lewis demanded,\u201cWhat hold did Marsh have on you Anton?\u201dAnton looked at the Doctor not Lewis and nodded, taking a little strength in the sympathy in the warm brown eyes of the strangely dressed man before saying, without looking at the inspector, \u201cHe was blackmailing me. I funded myself thorough college for my first degree through porn movies. He found out.\u201d\u201cPorn!\u201d exploded Lewis as Jamie asked,\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d while the Doctor reached across and tapped his knee gently, saying kindly,\u201cThank you for your honesty Professor Milyutin.\u201dWhile, at the same time, Hathaway\u2019s phone rang. As he went down the stairs to answer it he heard Anton exclaim,\u201cNot for money. For sex! And although I loathed the man, I did not want him dead! What kind of man do you think I am?\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0Hooper was on the phone to the sarge. He had guessed he had interrupted the interviewing of a witness. He doodled as he listened to Hathaway excuse himself and left the other people, including the boss, presumably.\u201cWhat have you got for us then?\" the sarge demanded. Hooper dropped his pen. His nibs was not in a good mood.\u201cGood intel from that vicar bloke, sarge. Thing is, he won\u2019t tell me much on the phone. He seems very scared, though, and the more we\u2019re digging on the victim, the more of a bastard con he seems, as for his boss, this Gulum...\u201dHathaway listened to all the confirmation and extra information on the body with a growing sense of relief. This was going to be an ordinary, messy, crime gang related killing after all, straightforward and unremarkable, probably a trained dog, no doubt an illegal, prohibited dangerous dog, maltreated, half starved and vicious. It would have to be destroyed, of course. Poor thing, it was just a weapon. The girl was no doubt terrified and confused by all she saw. Transformations from wolf to naked man indeed!\n", "5": "\nChapter Text\nAs the four men left Merton Street to walk back to Lewis\u2019 car, parked in Oriel Square, Lewis\u2019 phone rang. He tossed his keys to Hathaway as he answered,\u201cLewis.\u201dAfter the call was over, he informed Hathaway, the Doctor, and Jamie, that it had been Dr. Hobson on the phone and she required his presence immediately. The post-mortem had thrown up as many questions as it had answers, and she wanted to show him something.\u201cMight I come with you, Inspector?\u201d the Doctor asked, wringing his hands and looking up at him.Lewis looked for a moment that he might refuse, but he obviously remembered the UNIT brief that morning, and nodded curtly, \u201cSure. Why not? You might make more head or tail of this than Laura. James, you go on and interview this vicar, Manners.\u201dHathaway nodded, \u201cOf course Sir.\u201d\u201cWhat about me Doctor?\u201d\u201cAh, Jamie, I think you should go with the tall sergeant. You might be of use.\u201d The Doctor then came up to Jamie, seemingly to just pat him on the arm a goodbye, but he whispered quickly, he face twisting with urgency, \u201cAnd keep an ear out for you know what Jamie. The good sergeant will be looking for motive of human activity, so you must listen for anything else.\u201d\u201cWerewolves or shape shifters, aye,\u201d Jamie muttered quietly, matter of fact.\u201cAnything else,\u201d the Doctor stressed, \u201copen mind is the key to detecting, as it is to learning anything, don\u2019t close your mind in the opposite direction to the sergeant. Work together, please. We still might be wrong. I hope we are.\u201d\u201cOh. Aye. If you say so.\u201dWhile the Doctor and Jamie had been talking, the Doctor had also watched the almost wordless conversation between Lewis and Hathaway. Lewis had held out his hand and Hathaway had returned his keys, his head nodding in the direction of the car. Lewis and closed his hand over his keys, fingers brushing Hathaway\u2019s palm, to which Hathaway responded to with a dilation of his pupils and a quickening of his pulse not detectable to mere humans.\u201cI\u2019ll pick up my car at the station,\u201d he then said, and Lewis had responded in a teasing tone,\u201cNot far with those long legs, is it?\u201dHathaway responded with a grimace and glance to Jamie.\u201cJamie can move very fast indeed when he needs,\u201d the Doctor couldn\u2019t resist butting in.\u201cAye. What?\u201dHathaway tried and failed to hide his annoyance, \u201cCome on then Mr McCrimmon, let\u2019s get back to the station for my car.\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0The Doctor seemed ridiculously pleased to be sitting in the front of Lewis\u2019 car, he even asked to drive, to which Lewis gave an abrupt negative answer. He beamed at the colleges and commented on the bridge and the Cherwell before talking about the South Parks and Headington Hill before the Great War. Brookes University was a delight and a surprise to him, as was the size and the modernity of the John Radcliffe Hospitals Campus. Despite his discomfort with it all, Lewis began to try to work out when the Doctor had visited in the past and future too, as the Doctor also seemed to find a couple of colleges missing close to Greyhound and Angel meadows.They met Hobson in her main office; she was grabbing a bite to eat. Lewis apologised for their intrusion.\u201cYes, you have apologies to make, but not for my unfinished sandwich,\u201d Hobson said, standing quickly and wiping her mouth with a tissue. She glanced wistfully at her lunch before glaring angrily at the Inspector. The Doctor could sense some deep frustration and confusion coming from the pathologist. \u201cI tried to catch you at the station, but I have three RTs coming down any second so needed to be back here. Besides, come with me.\u201d She then seemed to notice the Doctor. \u201cSorry? Are you the consultant Hathaway emailed me about this morning?\u201d\u201cThis is the Doctor, Laura, he\u2019s here as an advisor, due to the size of the teeth marks and the dog saliva...\u201d\u201cWolf,\u201d Hobson interrupted him. \u201cAnd something else.\u201d She glared at him again. The Doctor smiled a hello and tried to hold out his hand to diffuse the situation, but the Inspector\u2019s hackles were now rising. The tension between these two was as loud as it was between the sergeant and his boss, expect it was one sided, Lewis deflecting this attraction through embarrassment, rather the guilt and mutual attraction that there seemed to be for his sergeant. Having thought that, he still would give it evens which way the inspector would finally go, given the man\u2019s age, gender, and background and the time he was in \u2013 silly, stupid, homophobia, more pronounced in the nineteenth and twentieth in some ways that it was in Jamie\u2019s century. Dear Jamie, he wondered how he was getting on with the sergeant. And of course, there was the almost-wolf DNA, the something else would be marks on human DNA and the lycanthropy trigger genes... was that Brie in the pathologist\u2019s sandwich. He was hungry... Oh my, they were angry at each other!\u201cLaura, what have I done?\u201d snapped Lewis.\u201cDone! Done? Lewis! How could you? After all your years in CID!\u201d\u201cLaura, what the hell...?\u201dAh. There was a rip, and it wasn\u2019t a straightforward time rip. He had thought as much. Very occasionally, he wished he might be wrong. He hoped the sideways rip had closed itself, for he hadn\u2019t a clue how to fix it, but he had no intention going to Them for help. Oh dear, things were getting complicated...\u00a0*\u00a0Meanwhile Mrs Manners, Louise, had showed James and Jamie into a large kitchen at the back of a new build house overlooking Grandpoint. She was heavily with child and struggled on crutches to walk. Jamie was worried for the wee woman and was impressed at the gentle way the guard \u2013 the policeman! \u2013 spoke. He explained they had come to see her husband, who had spoken to a colleague and requested an interview. She seemed unafraid, with nothing to hide, and they had followed her, at which point the sergeant had offered to make tea.Jamie looked out of the window, wildwoods, scrublands and a metal trackway \u2013 a railway! He remembered Victoria telling him about them. He wanted to ask the pastor\u2019s wife how she was, how long to go, but childbirth was woman\u2019s business, and although the Doctor would be cross with him and Zoe laugh, he just couldn\u2019t shake off some things from his own time. Fortunately, Hathaway asked.\u201cTwo months yet.\u201d She seemed to catch the men\u2019s looks. \u201cIt\u2019s twins. A boy and a girl. And I\u2019ve put my hips out. Thank you,\u201d she finished, as the skinny sergeant handed her a cup of tea. He put one in front of Jamie. Tea was something Jamie had learnt to appreciate from the \u2018future\u2019. While he sipped it he wondered how a woman could know what her unborn children would be, and marvelled yet again at all the wonders he saw. He was fairly sure in his day twins would be a surprise to the wife and midwife, let alone knowing if it were a boy or a girl! As for a sick cripple, with bad hips, he doubted she would survive the childbed. This woman was unafraid, merely annoyed at not being able to work! Jamie wondered if he could tell her to count her blessings and not moan. Fortunately the sergeant filled the silence.\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely view,\u201d Hathaway said for want of something to say.\u201cYes, from the back, but down on the left side it\u2019s all old, crumbling 1950s council houses, student let Victorian monstrosities and opposite they\u2019re building that new estate, starter homes and social housing. I worry about the value of the house. When my Dad bought it ten years ago for me to live in as I studied, the houses were better kept. Then the druggies moved in. And the squatters.\u201d She stopped and sighed. \u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t like me to talk like that. I wouldn\u2019t make a very good vicar\u2019s wife, would I?\u201d she sighed again.James wondered if that was why Manners hadn\u2019t taken a proper stipend position. But that was rude. They had been told her husband would be home soon, but how soon was soon. He felt awkward, sitting in the immaculate kitchen, Aga and all, wine rack, all the middle class trappings, except the rack was empty, the fridge too, he had noticed when he fetched the milk for the tea; they were obviously struggling to maintain standards since Mrs Manners lost her job through ill health and disability. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely here, though,\u201d he said diplomatically, \u201cmust be good for bird watching.\u201d He had spotted the binoculars and the notebooks and reference books.\u201cIt is, yes.\u201dThey sat and sipped their tea. The clock ticked. A blackbird trilled outside. A kite swooped down low. Jamie glared morosely. What must it be like, to be so out of your own time, James wondered? Of course, who knew what wonders Jamie had seen in the future or on other planets. If this time travelling alien business was true. Innocent and Lewis certainly had taken it at face value once UNIT had confirmed it. And the DNA sample couldn\u2019t lie.The clock ticked.The fridge hummed.The blackbird sang.\u201cIt\u2019s been so difficult for Dave!\u201d Mrs Manners, Louise, suddenly blurted out.\u201cAye, it can\u2019t be easy, finding a body like that,\u201d Jamie said sympathetically. \u201cNot if you\u2019re no used to it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Well, of course it is that. But he recognised him, and he wondered, with all that has been happening...\u201d she trailed off, actually putting her hand to her mouth, to stop her blurting out more.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hathaway asked. Jamie noted the man\u2019s voice had that cut glass, posh English way about it, sounding gentle and unaggressive, nevertheless possessing the authority and the expectation to be answered.\u00a0*\u00a0The Doctor held his breath as Dr Hobson lost her temper finally with Inspector Lewis\u2019 stubborn refusal to know what she was talking about. The Doctor suspected he was as in the dark as he seemed to Hobson\u2019s cryptic digs.\u201cYou compromised the body!\u201d Hobson hissed angrily. \u201cYour DNA is in the very wounds, saliva, skin cells, what the hell were you playing at? Even your mentor wouldn\u2019t spit or dribble on a body, even if he were about to pass out or throw up...\u201d\u201cWell, he wouldn\u2019t have been near enough!\u201d Lewis joked feebly.\u201cRobbie!\u201d Laura roared.\u201cI didn\u2019t! I wouldn\u2019t! I have no idea...\u201d\u201cMighten I interrupt? I do have an idea. And the good inspector did not do anything. Please, calm down, my dear...\u201d\u201cIf you call me your dear one more time I\u2019ll slice your balls off with my scalpel!\u201d Hobson retorted.\u201cIf he has them,\u201d Lewis muttered to himself, after all, who knew what aliens had or hadn\u2019t got? \u201cIt was a joke Doctor. Wasn\u2019t it Laura?\u201dThe Doctor held up his hands placatingly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to give offence, Dr Hobson. But I do know how the DNA came to be there, and it isn\u2019t the good Inspector\u2019s...\u201d\u201cYes it is. I have it on file.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had suspicions since I arrived here and the TARDIS detected strange disturbances. I was worried about a crude time corridor, I\u2019ve read about some crude time travel experiments in Oxford when I was at the Academy, I can\u2019t recall when or all the details, it was shut down however, but I had wondered... hoped... it was nothing to do with your murder. But now I see we are talking about a time breach sideways in time. But the coincidence is remarkable. It is and it isn\u2019t Inspector Lewis\u2019 DNA. What are the strange anomalies in the DNA? Lupine by any chance?\u201d\u201cNow look here Doctor... whoever you are. I know UNIT has sanctioned your involvement...\u201d\u201cU... what?\u201d the Doctor asked, turning and catching sight of Lewis just before he stopped shaking his head and drawing a line across his throat with his index finger. After all, the UNIT brief said quite categorically not to mention them to him, as \u2018we know him but he does not know us yet\u2019. Hobson had obviously seen the gestures too and understood. The Doctor wondered if he wanted to know his future? Perhaps not. \u201cNever mind Dr Hobson,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, please, may I please look at the samples and structures? Also, since I\u2019m here, might I see the body?\u201dHobson huffed out a frustrated sigh. \u201cOf course. But no one\u2019s DNA is the same. But I assume you know that.\u201d\u201cApart from identical twins, no, not in this universe, no. I take it you don\u2019t have an identical twin, do you, Inspector?\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0Soon after Louise\u2019s sudden outburst her husband returned. James stood and shook his hand and thanked him for offering information. Jamie tried to do likewise, but Hathaway\u2019s manner\u2019s that seemed old fashioned to Louise and Dave were centuries ahead of Jamie. It seemed so much hot air. Couldn\u2019t they get on with the questioning of the man? He had found the body, after all.Or not. As the pastor and the sergeant spoke, Jamie remembered some wee lasses had found the body at roughly the same time as Zoe, who wasn\u2019t so old herself, but seemed so calm and mature by comparison. Then this man, and then the Doctor and himself, had arrived at the body. The pastor had vomited while the Doctor had tried to save him. Jamie, to his regret, had been so fascinated by the obvious wild beast injuries he had not heard Zoe tell that she was giving chase. He should have protected her. Aye, or even caught the beast-man!If it was that? The Doctor told him to keep an open mind. The conversation seemed to be about bad landowners evicted the poor tenants, something he could relate too. So, there were plenty of human motives. Jealousy, and now the wanting to keep your home. Homes, clothes and technologies changed, people didn\u2019t. Jamie had learnt that soon after he walked on board the TARDIS.Hathaway was taking copious notes as Manners talked, his wife chipping in occasionally. The empty 1950s council houses, boarded up with wood and metal shutters as they were, had been the homes to some several families and single young people for some years \u2013 a whole community of squatters. They kept the gardens, grew vegetables and flowers, and were not any bother in terms of noise \u2013 here Louise had sniffed, obviously disagreeing with her husband, mentioning something about bonfires.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have electricity \u2013 they used to have cooking fires Sergeant,\u201d Manners explained. He went on to explain that Gulum construction had recently bought the site to expand the new build development the other side of the road and intended to renovate and refurbish the large three and four bed houses into studios and one-bed apartments. Likewise the huge, crumbling Victorian and Georgian town houses the other side, which were currently student and single young professional let, in theory, although many had been used to house vulnerable homeless single people and teenage mums, by the city council. They believed one might have been a cannabis factory, but the police had raided it some months ago. Louise added that another squatter had moved into that building, the last two up two down Victorian workers\u2019 cottage at the end of the row adjoined to the grander town houses from the early part of the nineteenth century.The most telling part, the relevant information, was the fact that over the past six months, first the squatters, then the students and council placed homeless people had been evicted, not very legally or nicely, by one Alan Marsh and a bunch of thugs under his direction. Finally they thugs had tackled the crackden in the last end cottage. It had been nasty and they believed the police were called. Hathaway assured them he would check the records once back at the station.Things had then been eerily quiet for a few weeks, then the hippie commune of squatters, or some of them, had moved back in. And then the other squatter, who kept himself to himself moved in at the other, Victorian, end. He seemed a bit crazy, very unkempt, sometimes he was smile at you, other times snarl. He looked perpetually bewildered and terrified. They had no idea how he was living. Louise had the feeling he might even be poaching on Nature Reserve and University grounds, she had seen him a couple of times with a rabbit and once with a duck.Marsh and his pack of heavies had returned three nights ago and dragged out the squatters, children and all, burning their belongings. Dave\u2019s boss, Father Peter Bryson, had given them shelter ever since in the Church hall, if the sergeant would like to interview them. But be gentle, these people were traumatised and since they had not been quite living inside the law, were scared, understandable, of the police.\u201cDiscretion and gentleness are my middle names,\u201d Hathaway said, a little smile tipping up the corners of his mouth. What was wrong with that inspector, Jamie wondered, it wasn\u2019t as if he were - well, normal, was it? Jamie had caught him looking at his sergeant\u2019s arse more than one time in the short time he had known them.Jamie was so busy wondering how to get these ill fated lovers together he nearly missed the rest of the information Manners told Hathaway, including the name of the strange, lone squatter and the fact that Manners had seen him only minutes before he saw the girls. He had looked crazy and wild, as if he were an animal hunting. He had been sniffing the air, and his eyes, well, um, Manners knew it sounded weird, but they had been yellow...Jamie knew it!Meanwhile, Hathaway was fishing around for a more rational explanation, but his fingers slipped into his pocket, where he had taken to carrying a rosary with him. He curled his fingers tightly around the crucifix. He centred himself. Right. Procedure. That was what Lewis had been demanding, even if the unthinkable were true, carry on with proper procedure, or else you were lost. James thought himself back to the night before, to sleeping on Lewis\u2019 sofa, Lewis\u2019 smell in the pillows, and told himself that Himself was wise...\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\nWhen James Hathaway and Jamie McCrimmon returned to the station they checked into the canteen first, to see if Zoe had returned. The Doctor had given her instructions to be back at the station for \u2018tea time\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s early yet,\u201d Hathaway reassured Jamie, whom he could see was getting into a bit of a panic. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine. She told me she wanted to try to squeeze in at least the Ashmolean and University Museums as well as the Museum of Science and the Bodlian. That should take at least an afternoon, if she only glances at each exhibit. How about I get us some coffee?\u201d\u201cTea,\u201d Jamie said, smiling up at the lanky thing. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ve no got the hang of coffee, and it does strange things to the Doctor, he\u2019s too much on the go without adding to it.\u201d\u201cFine. Tea it is.\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0Lewis and the Doctor returned to the station just as James and Jamie were getting comfortable with their tea, while Hathaway chased up the reports from Drugs and Community concerning any raids, dealers, factories and civil disturbances. As he did so he had tried to explain the workings of the internet, intranet, PNC, and computer records, and access in general to an eighteenth century illiterate. Not that he was illiterate now, Jamie was at pains to explain how one of the first things the Doctor had done when he joined him was teach him his letters and numbers. Still, he didn\u2019t seem that bothered or interested in explanations, saying only, \u201cAye, that thing,\u201d occasionally. But he was quick to take in the actual information, however, whatever and however it was imparted, linking reports of the cannabis factory to two of the squatters, who had later been arrested for affray following their evictions.Hathaway grasped quickly what Jamie was getting at and typed in the names of the two squatters. They both had a police record an arm long, mostly for affray, disturbance of the peace, and obstruction, most of which had taken place at peace and anti-cuts protests back in the eighties, road protests in the nineties, and anti-capitalist demonstrations in the current century. Typically, one, Simon Strange, was known as \u2018Swampie\u2019, the other, Bill Patel, was known as \u2018Gandhi\u2019, but seemed not to follow his hero and namesake, judging by his conviction for assaulting a police officer and a second prison term for common assault on his girlfriend. There were also a list of cautions and fines an arm long each, on possession of Class B and C drugs, naturally. Most interesting of all the convictions was one of Strange\u2019s convictions, a fine and the dog destroyed, for owning a \u2018dangerous dog\u2019. PNC also listed he had been suspected of being involved in the dog fights up Holton way back in 2004/5/6, but nothing had been proven.Jamie had been arguing with Hathaway that a wee fighting dog could never have caused those injuries, the size of the teeth, for starters, and why couldn\u2019t the silly boy accept that they were looking for a werewolf, when Lewis burst into his office in a foul mood, followed by a worried looking Doctor. Jamie got up immediately from his perch on the end of Hathaway\u2019s desk and touched the Doctor\u2019s arm, asking if he were alright. Hathaway turned and looked up at his boss, flinching and flushing slightly as Lewis flung his jacket on the back of his chair with a choice swearword.\u201cBloody, bloody doctor!\u201dAlarmed, Hathaway looked to the Doctor standing in the doorway. Jamie moved protectively in front of his friend. \u201cNot me, the pathologist. She\u2019s made some startling discoveries. Ooh, is that tea Jamie? Thank you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Where did you get that tea Jamie? Were their cakes? Biscuits? Is this a good time for jammie dodgers or have they stopped being made? We ate them in the Underground, with that business with the Yetis and the Great Intelligence? Do you remember? I wouldn\u2019t mind getting my hands on some more.\u201dJamie, understanding that the Doctor wished to give Inspector a wide berth for a while, replied, \u201cAye, the canteen, there were these little packets of biscuits. I think some of them might be those ones. I\u2019ll show ye.\u201d They closed the door behind them.\u201cI\u2019ll get you some tea Sir,\u201d Hathaway said, standing, watching the door close on their strange UNIT consultants.\u201cNo. Stay. I don\u2019t need tea. I just need my head to stop hurting and this bloody case to make sense.\u201d\u201cI have a suspect Sir, well, at least two, but one seems more likely. Not forgetting the ex girlfriend and the Russian boyfriend...\u201d\u201cWe have a suspect too, but you\u2019ll not believe it. I don\u2019t bloody believe it! Damn!\u201d\u201cBut Sir, the victim has been working for Gulum Construction and Gulum Lettings, he took a bunch of thugs and evicted a hippie commune one side of the Manners, and a mixed let of homeless people and students the other side. One of the evicted hippies, who is not such a hippie really, he has form, Sir, including using and owning dangerous dogs and...\u201d Hathaway knew he wasn\u2019t being very clear, that he was babbling almost, but he didn\u2019t like the sick, defeated, look on his boss\u2019 face, and Jamie\u2019s talk of werewolves too had made him very uncomfortable.Lewis had been sitting at his desk, head in his hands, in his shirtsleeves, his tie loosened. He looked up and watched his sergeant uncharacteristically pace and babble with sad, heavy, almost hangdog eyes. Eventually he snapped,\u201cShut up!\u201dHathaway shut up immediately, looking hurt and confused. His boss had only ever shouted at him twice, once over his keeping the fact he\u2019d found Mrs Lewis\u2019 killer and That Time, as that afternoon after the university\u2019s gay pride was forever termed in his head, with very large capital Ts.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sir,\u201d he stumbled out.\u201cJust shut up James! Stop looking for rational explanations. Rival gangs, evicted crusties with big illegal dogs, abused exes looking for revenge, none of this will work lad. There is no bloody rational explanation. We have the killer\u2019s DNA, conclusive proof. Except you know what?\u201cWhat?\u201d James almost whispered, afraid of the supernatural, or given UNIT, alien, answer.\u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m the prime suspect. My DNA is crawling all over the victim\u2019s wounds...\u201d\u201cCould you have...?\u201d James began, but trailed of, Lewis was the best detective he had ever worked for, of course he would never have accidentally contaminated evidence.\u201c\u2019Course I bloody didn\u2019t James! Dammit! The Doctor is talking about dimension gates and wormholes in space and time and parallel worlds... It\u2019s my DNA but it isn\u2019t, as it\u2019s also a wolf\u2019s DNA and then Laura says it\u2019s got something else. The Doctor called it the...\u201d Lewis paused and looked up at James again, who was standing stock-still, white as a sheet, looking down on him in horror. \u201cThe Doctor called it the shift trigger, always seen in lycanthropotic life forms...\u201d he shrugged.\u201cBut... but... there still could be a normal explanation. We have people with motive, opportunity and form...\u201d\u201cFor all we know James, this... this other me has motive. I don\u2019t know. All I know is stupid Hammer Horror movies from the 70s, snuggled up on the back row with Val, and comics when I was a nipper in the fifties and sixties. What do I know of real... werewolves? Maybe they aren\u2019t animals, maybe they\u2019re just as rational as a wolf as they are a man...?\u201d\u201cWould you listen to yourself Sir? You sound crazy. I won\u2019t have it!\u201d Hathaway even stamped his foot, just to show the universe it wasn\u2019t to go changing the rules like that.\u201cRight. Tea, you said. Good plan. And procedure. That\u2019s what I said last night. So let\u2019s treat this like any normal case. A werewolf is still a person with an identity, a motive, and so on. Fetch us some tea then lad, then report on your interview with the vicar.\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0\u201cSo, this DN whatisit is like the fingermarks, no two people have them?\u201d\u201cAlmost, Jamie, almost,\u201d the Doctor replied, misjudging his dunked jammie dodger and watching it dissolve over his fingers. Jamie wanted to lick it off for him but they were surrounded by police and he wasn\u2019t sure if loving another man was illegal or legal or somewhere in the middle, like his own time. Last two times they were back on Earth in England it had been against the law! Besides, sometime things were best left private anyway. The Doctor licking his finger before continuing distracted him, and he struggled to hear the Doctor go on, talking around his fingers,\u201cI think the good Inspector is in shock. It\u2019s too much to get your head around in one go, lycanthropy and a parallel world... I don\u2019t think we are talking about the beasts of this universe\u2019s mythology, you know, but a civilisation based on those who were, perhaps descended from upright wolves and yet have shape-shifting powers... then again...\u201d he looked up. \u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe must go back to that couple you and Sergeant Hathaway talked to, but with the Inspector. If they recognise him then we know my guess is correct!\u00a0*\u00a0As the Doctor and Jamie were returning to Lewis\u2019 office they met the inspector and his sergeant on their way out.\u201cGoing somewhere Inspector?\u201d the Doctor asked innocently.Inspector Lewis had the grace to look embarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the Manners, after we\u2019ve visited his boss and the squatters living in his church hall. We\u2019ve got to get a wriggle on here, he\u2019s expecting us in ten minutes.\u201d\u201cI take it you have no objection to my joining you?\u201dLewis shook his head. Of course he did, everything about the man and his theories were making him feel very uncomfortable at the moment.\u201cUs, you mean?\u201d Jamie asked the Doctor.\u201cAh, Jamie. I\u2019m rather worried about Zoe. I\u2019d hate for the poor girl to have to fend for herself another night.\u201d\u201cAye. That\u2019s true. But I don\u2019t know this city and time Doctor, how will I find her in all those colleges and shops and museum things?\u201d\u201cJames, go and get Mr McCrimmon one of those tourist maps from the front desk and mark on where Miss Heriot said she was going.\u201d\u201cWill do.\u201d\u201cMight Jamie borrow your phone, too sergeant?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a police property,\u201d Hathaway replied tersely.\u201cI noticed you have a second phone, your personal one. Just for a couple of hours. So Jamie can keep in touch.\u201d He held out his hand.Hathaway glanced at Lewis, who shrugged and then nodded. Hathaway handed the Doctor his Nokia and left them to fetch the map, listening to the Doctor explain how it worked to Jamie as he left. He was surprised at how quickly the eighteenth century Highlander picked it up.\u00a0*\u00a0Father Peter Bryson was an older man, growing quite frail, walking with a stick, but still with a ramrod straight back and upright in his bearing. He had the aura of a man once very active and sporty, and bearing his cross of infirmity with difficulty. Despite his age, he wore; rather than stereotype little rimless round glasses, some funky, trendy, rectangles in bright purple leopard print fames. Hathaway thought they might have been FCUK and had seen some similar at his own opticians for around \u00a3150! The tiny bit of him that was still an almost priest strongly disapproved of such decadence. His own secret frames were nowhere near so ostentatious, despite the cost of his suits!Father Peter shook all three men\u2019s hands, made no comment either way when the scruffy short man was introduced only by a title and as a UNIT consultant, and led them round the back of his gothic church to a squat, square redbrick utilitarian building labelled \u2018the new hall\u2019 on a bright sign.Inside were camps beds arranged in family groupings. In the middle was a mess of papers, crayons, glue and about five children from one to seven and a couple of women in long skirts with long hair. Two teenagers were laid on their camp beds. At the very end an old fashioned cathode-ray tube TV on a trolley with caster wheels with a freeview set top box and aerial precariously balanced on top of that was showing CBBC\u2019s Horrible Histories. Four older children in a mix of brightly coloured but worn out clothes and hand knitted jumpers were arranged around it.Two more women and a man were about, and a man was bustling in the kitchen. The smell of something beany and spicy was wafting out. It looked and felt like a cross between a church camp, a hippie commune, and a church hall full of refugees in shock. Everyone looked up and regarded the men suspiciously.\u201cUm,\u201d began Father Peter, \u201cthese are the gentlemen I said were coming. Please, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, they need your help.\u201d\u201cAye,\u201d Lewis smiled at the collective sets of eyes now all glaring at him and Hathaway, including the older children. The younger ones, however, were all looking at the Doctor, who had already squatted down near to them and was admiring their handiwork. The mothers, also the home educators, Hathaway had guessed, had already decided that art therapy was the way to go, as Hathaway could see pictures of smashed things and burning homes. His boss went on,\u201cA man was murdered. In the course of our investigation we have come to know he was not a very nice man, particularly to you. So, although you might be glad he\u2019s dead, we really do need to find his killer.\u201d\u201cHe was killed in a most dreadful manner,\u201d the Doctor said, standing. \u201cHello, I\u2019m the Doctor, I\u2019m not actually with the police. Well, I am, as I came in their car, but I\u2019m not connected with them in anyway. I\u2019m helping them. Perhaps we can all brainstorm ideas away from the little ones?\u201dAs one the adults, teens, and older children, looked at an older woman with wild, long, grey, hair, dressed in a flowered dress over wide legged blue cotton trousers. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the garden,\u201d she said, \u201cAngie and Ted, you look after the others.\u201d Angie and Ted were obviously the teenagers. The girl, Angie, rolled her eyes and sighed, but Ted got of his bed and went to sit among the colouring and crafts and smaller ones.The garden turned out to be the garden of remembrance on the edge of the cemetery, naturally. The hippies all stood in a defensive semi circle around the two police officers and the strange little man. The Doctor was the only one who smiled.\u201cFirst,\u201d Hathaway began forcefully; trying to take control of this interview, sensing the Doctor was about to ask something supernatural, \u201cwe are looking for two of your commune...\u201d\u201cOr not actually with you,\u201d the Doctor interrupted, holding a hand to stop Hathaway, his bumbling charade falling off him like a cloak. \u201cIn fact, one man, a squatter from the other end of the houses to you, the smaller row of Victorian cottages I believe?\u201d He looked to Hathaway, who nodded reluctantly, then glanced angrily to his boss, who sighed and rubbed his eye.\u201cHe\u2019s an older man. We believe he\u2019s been living rough, hunting for his food, in the burnt out end house, the one that used to be a crackden, according to Drugs at the station,\u201d Lewis added.\u201cBad business that,\u201d a bearded man in red jeans said.\u201cMade us all feel not safe,\u201d added the grey haired woman. \u201cWe were glad when it was closed down.\u201d\u201cNot by your lot though,\u201d the man said. There was a family resemblance; all three men noted it, a son perhaps? Younger brother?\u201cNo,\u201d Lewis sighed heavily. \u201cAlthough it was being watched and they had plans, working with the council and housing association. But then the whole row of properties were sold on.\u201d\u201cTo Gulum Construction and Lettings,\u201d Hathaway added.\u201cThey sent thugs. Or someone did. When they moved on the crackheads, it was okay. A relief really. But then they came for us. Same thugs. We thought it was the new company, but we couldn\u2019t get proof.\u201d\u201cWe have some now. We\u2019ve passed it onto a colleague of ours,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut the Doctor was asking about this man who was seen near the victim by several witnesses, he was seen minutes before the victim was discovered, and running away afterwards.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clue to his identity though,\u201d Hathaway added, \u201conly those we spoke to think he was some kind of homeless, mentally ill, man who moved in to the end terrace after it had been fire bombed.\u201d\u201cDo you know who the policemen are talking about?\u201d the Doctor asked gently, his eyes raking across the circle of crusties and hippies, watching them grow uncomfortable, and their eyes all dart to Lewis\u2019 face and then slide away hurriedly.\u201cYes,\u201d the older woman, their spokeswoman and leader, such as they had, said finally.\u201cCan you describe him for us?\u201d\u201cLike the Inspector, really. It\u2019s uncanny. He was unshaven with longer hair, really unkempt and dressed in rags, and really smelly, he\u2019s unwashed...\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s totally rank, really,\u201d added a younger woman, dressed in a pink and grey slip dress and chunky cardigan. \u201cBut other than that...\u201d\u201cIt could be you, inspector,\u201d the man in the red jeans added, nodding, not really looking Lewis directly in the eye.Lewis nodded, but the entire commune could see he was unnerved and uncomfortable. If the scientist from UNIT hadn\u2019t been there, maybe they would have thought a brother, but several of the older, protest-scared eco warriors had encountered UNIT in the past, and were a little freaked out themselves. They looked to their leader, who pulled the conversation around, looking only at the Doctor.\u201cLast time we saw him he\u2019d caught a rabbit,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was four days ago, just before we were moved on again. It was dusk, and he was walking back across the meadow from the woods. He was naked and there was blood on his mouth. It was so weird; I just slipped out of sight. I was gathering nettles for a soup.\u201d\u201cIt weren\u2019t the first time he\u2019d been seen naked at night, or early morning, was it?\u201d another woman said, a young woman in a vest top and green tiered floor length skirt. She had been the one busy with the children.There were murmurs of no and shakes of the head.\u201cOr blood on his mouth,\u201d a young man with a shaven head dressed in multi coloured trousers and a black tee added, her young man probably, by the close way they stood.\u201cLast time I saw him dressed he was wearing the same ragged blue trousers, would have once been part of a suit, I reckon, and a white ripped vest, not a top, you know, proper old fashioned gent\u2019s under vest.\u201cThank you,\u201d the Doctor said. \u201cAnd you are all sure that he looks rather like a wild, unkempt, deranged version of Inspector Lewis here?\u201dLewis began to sweat, his discomfort was apparent to everyone. Hathaway stood protectively next to him, pressing himself close, biting his thumbnail. The collective commune looked anywhere but at the inspector, his sergeant, or the strange man called the Doctor.\u201cYes,\u201d their spokeswoman finally said.\u201cThank you again. I do hope you find somewhere to establish your commune. More people need to live as frugally as you if the world is to stay so undamaged,\u201d the Doctor said kindly, walking away, obviously expecting the policemen to follow.\u201cWhat about...?\u201d Hathaway began.\u201cLater Sergeant Hathaway, later,\u201d the Doctor called over his shoulder. \u201cYou can follow your leads, hunches, and suspects after we have ruled out this one. This one is urgent. The sun sets in less than an hour...\u201dOnce the three men were back in Lewis\u2019 car, the Doctor said, \u201cWell, I suppose we could still follow your plan Inspector, and visit the vicar and his wife, but they will probably only confirm the commune\u2019s description of our suspect.\u201d\u201cMe, you mean?\u201d Lewis huffed out an angry sigh. \u201cAye. You want me to drive us straight to that burned out house.\u201d\u201cIf you would Inspector, before sunset would be by far the best. A call for back-up might be an idea.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be laughed at, you know. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019s there first, okay? Ask a few questions. I call for back up if we need to bring him in. for all your talk of parallel universes and dimension gates and wormholes, he might just be lost and gone a bit mad.\u201d He might have a living Val he wants to get back home too, Lewis didn\u2019t add, the thought of another him had lead invariably to another Val, one who had never been hit by a getaway driver on a pavement. One who did all her Christmas shopping in Oxford rather than Oxford Street in London. Who lived in a family where Mark, not being grief stricken and ignored, had never felt the need to run off to the other side of the world, still hating him. He\u2019d go a bit crazy if he lost all that.Mind you, he had, hadn\u2019t he!\n", "7": "\nChapter Text\nIt took five strikes of the flint to get the blasted fire going. He was hungry. He\u2019d not eaten for some while, since he had...Wasn\u2019t to think of that. Couldn\u2019t be helped. It was just. Once he had had that right. He had once been the law. A life for a life. That woman had lost her baby and all those animals of the hippies. He had been so proud since he had been here not to ever take their chickens, too...Roast duck should fill his stomach before nightfall. If he wasn\u2019t hungry he\u2019d do less damage...He looked at the skyline and sighed. Nightfall wasn\u2019t long and there was the full moon to contend with, the third moon since he had arrived... here!Here being exactly were he left but not. It hadn\u2019t taken him too long to work out this Oxford wasn\u2019t his, this world wasn\u2019t his, but a lot longer to work out what and were and how, if he had at all. Far, far, too much to get his head around. It was only because his Lyn and Mark were such geeks and loved all that sci fi and fantasy nonsense he had had any grounding at all.He attached the plucked duck to his makeshift spit as the fire began to grow nicely and he sat down beside it, rocking slightly. He needed to get home; this place was dangerous and cruel!\u00a0*\u00a0It took less than five minutes to get to there in the car. As they approached the house Lewis remarked in wonder that he and Val had looked at this house as a possibility when they had first moved back down from Newcastle and were living with his mother in law.The Doctor looked at him sharply, \u201cInteresting, isn\u2019t it Inspector?\u201d he asked cryptically. Lewis almost snarled and looked away, not wanting to contemplate any similarity with the suspect.It took another two minutes to park behind the boarded up, burnt out, end house that their suspect was squatting in. They could smell something cooking as they made their around the ripped bits of wood and corrugated iron fencing that had been ripped down into the back garden, over grown with weeds and grass grown almost to the men\u2019s waists, above the Doctor\u2019s! He led the two policemen. They could see a fire flicker in the back room; smoke pouring out of the broken, empty window frames. Over the fire squatted a man dressed in a tattered suit.The Doctor pointed to a line of bushes and broken furniture and the three men squatted behind, hidden, observing. The Doctor looked up at the sky, the sun sliding down beyond the horizon, the reddening of the western skyline already beginning. The east already was growing dark blue, the full moon clearly visible as it rose.\u201cI suggest you call for back-up Inspector,\u201d the Doctor whispered. \u201cBut quietly. His hearing will be far better than yours.\u201d Both detectives noted how the Doctor did not include his own hearing as deficient compared to a possible werewolf.\u201cI can\u2019t call for back-up,\u201d Lewis hissed back angrily. \u201cWhat do I say? We have no evidence. I\u2019ve not discussed this suspect with the CS at all. What the hell do I say anyway? I\u2019d be the laughing stock of the station!\u201d\u201cWhat about concerns for a mental ill man living rough who maybe you suspect?\u201d\u201cI have no evidence,\u201d Lewis repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s doing no harm. If I say that I\u2019ll get a community officer and a social worker and maybe a psychiatric nurse here. Do we want to put them all at risk, if you think there is one now?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m right Inspector, every second we delay here is a risk. The moon has risen and it\u2019s twilight. Once the light has gone he\u2019ll change, so if we are going to reason with him we better do it fast. If you can\u2019t call for back-up, what are we going to do? Best we come back in the morning.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d And with that, Lewis nodded to his sergeant and stood up, heading across the grass to the open back door leading into a very fire blackened kitchen.Annoyed, the Doctor scuttled after them and tried to attract Hathaway\u2019s attention. He managed to as they got to the door. The Doctor was sure that by now they could be heard and smelt if not seen.\u201cPhone Jamie. Tell him to get here,\u201d the Doctor urged, pulling on the grey sleeve of Hathaway\u2019s jacket. \u201cStay here out of sight and if needed, call for back-up.\u201dHathaway nodded and slipped behind a laburnum tree that was by the kitchen door.\u00a0*\u00a0Robbie was intent on his dinner. It smelled good, and he needed to eat soon. He stood up with the spit in hand, the smell of roasted foul over-powering and filling his nostrils. The fire spat as grease dripped into it. As he took the first bite he froze, he was sure he could hear footsteps. He let his hand holding his meal drop and sniffed the air.Intruders!Again!He hoped it was those damned heavies from the construction company. They deserved everything they got. If not, he prayed he could control himself...*Lewis kicked in the sitting room door and saw a man standing in front of him, staring at the doorway, dressed in the tattered remains of clothes that were so familiar to him. They were, after all, his clothes, or once were, for they were an a cashmere jersey in red over blue shirt and the trousers of one of his better suits, the dark blue one, but the clothes were now ripped, ragged and dirty with mud, brick dust and blood. His hair was growing out of its cut and he had a full, untrimmed, beard. The man\u2019s eyes stared back at him with his own bright blue ones under the shaggy hair...\u00a0*\u00a0How could this be!Yet, hadn\u2019t he decided months ago after the first few weeks he was in some other Oxford, some other world. He had fallen down the rabbit hole, gone mad, and now, here was another him!\u201cYou?\u201d he said gruffly, he had spoken so little over the past three months.\u201cAye, it would seem so,\u201d Lewis said carefully, glancing at the Doctor, who had come into the room beside him slowly, making no sudden movements, as one would an animal. He stared at the man, the other him, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off his own face staring back at him, bruised, scratched, and bloodied, covered with the unkempt beard.\u201cYou should go,\u201d Robbie snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the Doctor asked gently. \u201cI know you have been pulled here from your own universe.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was chasing a suspect down Queen\u2019s Lane. There was an explosion, a flash, something. I thought I was being shot at. I went to call for back-up and saw he was dead, there right in front of me, burned up. He smelt rank, not right. My phone wouldn\u2019t work. It took me hours to find the police station. It was in the wrong bloody place. Clothes were different. Shops. You have cars in the city centre. The Westgate monorail up to the park and rides were gone. Too many houses on meadows. It wasn\u2019t right! It\u2019s not right!\u201d Robbie was now shouting, panicked.\u00a0*\u00a0Meanwhile Hathaway had called Jamie McCrimmon and gave him a brief summary of what was happening. Jamie had just found Zoe, but when he heard he was needed he set off at a fast run, he could remember perfectly where they had gone earlier in Hathaway\u2019s car. It was, however, an almost two mile trek.Zoe had begun to follow him, asking all sorts of questions, starting with where the phone had come from and going on from there. He could not wait for her. He only hoped she would give up and go back to the TARDIS or the police station.\u00a0*\u201cDid you kill him? The man in the meadow?\u201d the Doctor asked gently.\u201cYes,\u201d Robbie replied sadly. \u201cHe was hurting people. Many people. The police here did nothing. I watched those gentle people suffer. And the ill ones. The ones polluted by your monstrous drugs. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t make a habit of killing people. But they needed defending. What kind of law do you have?\u201d This last question was directed at the other Lewis, with not so much anger, as sadness and despair.\u201cWe do out best,\u201d Lewis said sadly. \u201cSometimes the memory of killing to defend others never leaves us, does it?\u201d he said, meeting his own sad eyes, realising that his other self had gone completely mad. He had too without Val, but fortunately he\u2019d been in his own world, and not called to that kind of decision in a moment, as he had several times earlier in his career as a sergeant. But this had been different, the other him had hunted and killed. Not pushed gun away or grabbed the child and watched the murderer fall. But what did he know, he had not seen what Marsh and his heavies had done to this Robbie\u2019s adopted neighbours.The stood staring at each other, never blinking or looking away, trying to get the measure of the other... The Doctor decided to break the silence. \u201cI can help you,\u201d he said, fingers crossed behind his back. He had only slipped out of the universe by accident once or twice. He knew TARDISes could visit other, parallel worlds, despite it being forbidden by the High Council. After all, in the Time of Rassilon, so myth said, all other Gallifreys had been obliterated; they were the only ones, the only Lords of Time, in the entire multiverse.\u201cHow?\u201d Lewis turned to look at him. Alien he might be, intelligent without question, but travelling in time maybe, but between worlds seemed a step too far. Besides, he could see the crossed fingers.\u201cWho is he?\u201d demanded Robbie with a snarl. His eyes were changing, glowing, growing yellow.\u201cThis is the Doctor, he\u2019s a sort of expert on the alien and weird.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m no alien. You are. You have no wolfbloods in your world. Instead was have half-cocked stories that your children frighten themselves with. You are a wild, unordered, immodest people, who let your young roam in packs and take no care of the sick and the vulnerable.\u201d He turned to the Doctor. \u201cCan you take me home to my...\u201dRobbie froze, his speech tailed off. He stared beyond the Doctor and this other, timid, him. He couldn\u2019t believe it.Thinking he had heard Lewis shout earlier, Hathaway had ignored the Doctor\u2019s instructions and walked in to the sitting room.\u201cJames,\u201d Robbie breathed out. \u201cMy James.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d James said, pressing himself to the wall. Did the Doctor suspect something, was that why he had wanted him kept outside? The man was Lewis, and yet was not... he was changing from the unkempt tramp to something else as he looked. The blue eyes were half yellow, glittering and feral.Lewis looked from this other Robbie to James and back again. \u201cHe\u2019s my James!\u201d he shouted, wondering what he was doing, not liking the predatorial way the other Robbie was moving towards Hathaway, movements growing more lupine with every step.Robbie stopped in his tracked and stared back at the other Robbie, the one that belonged here, in this disordered world. He was confused, instinct and passion and fear growing as the wolf took over. It smelt like his James, looked like him...\u201cHe\u2019s mine!\u201d Lewis repeated in a snarl, stepping in front of James in a second, feeling his own hackles rise, feeling some old atavistic fear of the wild, of the wolf, about this man, this other Robbie...The bearded Lewis stood stock still a moment, staring at his likeness as he had been before, in the moments he had arrived, snarling, his eyes glittering, turning from glittering pale blue and yellow through to bright, shining, greeny-gold. Then he shoved Lewis out of the way and took a step towards James that became a leap as the last inky-blue purple in the sky turned black and night fell...The wolf landed on James, knocking him clean on his feet, even though he has been braced against the wall. He was momentarily winded and his head cracked on the ground, not stunning him, but hurting his ear and the side of his head. He felt the wolf paw at him, rolling him on to his back, and licking the side of his ear. He closed his eyes, terrified; he was going to be eaten. Or worst; bitten and turned into a werewolf. Or was that still a myth? The Doctor had said so much was myth and babbled about different evolution and biology and universes that James\u2019 entire world was by now upside down and all the learning and knowledge he had in his head, all the exams and qualifications he had passed, no longer seemed to count for anything. He was going to die in ignorance, and that was frustrating if not unforgivable!After a few moments James realised he was neither dead not harmed in anyway, apart from being pinned to the floor on his back. He opened his eyes and saw two bright pale blue wolf eyes regarding him with intelligence, indeed, with confusion, as if this other Lewis, this wolf-Lewis, had expected him to change too, to become a wolf. He reached up, becoming aware that his sleeve was ripped as he did so, to touch the wolf, to stroke the face very gently.The wolf looked back with sadness, longing, and love. He nuzzled James\u2019 hand. James petted back. The wolf leaned over and nuzzled his face, his ear, licking his ear again. James closed his eyes again, afraid again, but not of death this time, but of something else entirely. \u2018My James\u2019, this Robbie had said, \u2018my James\u2019. This other James had everything he wanted, everything he longed for, everything he was denied, everything that was wrong and sinful but so needed...Meanwhile the Doctor was talking to the wolf, trying to plead with him that this wasn\u2019t his James Hathaway, he wouldn\u2019t transform, that he belonged to this universe, and to please get off him and let him go. He could see the strange bonding that seemed to be going on and it alarmed him.Lewis, however, only saw James pinned under the wolf, even if that wolf had been a man, his double, intelligence enough if more that a little mad, and was torn between reactions, that his sergeant was pinned under a wild animal and that his sergeant was in a hostage situation, held by the murderer they had come to apprehend. The key to keeping sane, as he had decided a day ago, was to keep everything as close to procedure as possible. He was casting around the room, lit only by the flickering fire and the street light outside the garden, for some form of weapon. He could find nothing and was stealing up the courage to tackle the wolf barehanded as Jamie entered the house.No one noticed Jamie as he crept into the fire lit room. He heard the Doctor\u2019s incessant babble as the foolish wee man tried to reason with the monster, as usual, and saw the policeman looking frantically around for a weapon, but mostly he saw a large dark brown wolf, greying at the paws and muzzle, pinning the lovely, shy, awkward, James to the floor, slobbering over his face. Without thinking he reacted quickly, pulling his dirk from his boot and throwing himself on the animal\u2019s back. It was over in a flash, the wolf hadn\u2019t the time to react to the assault before its throat was cut cleanly and effectively by Jamie\u2019s practiced cut. He\u2019d killed enough sheep and cattle in his time, for food, back home in his family croft, and enough English soldiers too. And all manner of monsters. This was just one more, so Jamie thought.He stood up and kicked the dying beast off James, who howled and sat up, throwing himself over the creature.\u201cYou killed him!\u201d he cried angrily at Jamie, \u201cYou\u2019ve killed him!\u201d And he buried his face in the unblooded fur of his side.\n", "8": "\nChapter Text\nJamie stood, looking down at what he had done, at the wolf\u2019s carcass and the man whom he had supposed he had just saved seemingly weeping into the creature\u2019s side. He felt the Doctor come to stand by his side, but did not move. He was panting heavily. He did not glorify in death. He waited for the Doctor\u2019s anger; the Doctor too, hated death. The Doctor squeezed his shoulder gently,\u201cWe saw him change. Until moments ago he was as much Robert Lewis as the Inspector standing there.\u201dJamie said nothing, but watched Hathaway tighten his grip and the Inspector come up to him and squat down behind him, putting a hand between his thin shoulder blades and rub gently.\u201cCome away now James. He\u2019s dead. I\u2019m here.\u201dJames looked up, his eyes burning with mostly unshed, painful, tears. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have hurt me. He wouldn\u2019t! I know!\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d Lewis said gently. He put his hand out and touched the wolf\u2019s fur, then, leaving his hold of James\u2019 back, touched his own dark brown, greying hair on his own head, wonderingly.James looked up at Jamie. \u201cYou killed him!\u201d he spat out again. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t hurting me! He wouldn\u2019t! \u2018My James\u2019 he said.\u201d\u201cJamie couldn\u2019t have known that Sergeant,\u201d the Doctor said. \u201cHe saw a wolf pinning you to the floor. He saved you. You don\u2019t know what the wolf in him wouldn\u2019t have done. Or the man, for that matter.\u201d\u201cAye,\u201d Lewis sat back onto his heels. \u201cIf I had a weapon I\u2019d have done the same.\u201d He looked up to Jamie, \u201cThough not so cleanly, lad. He didn\u2019t suffer, did he? This wolf... me?\u201dJamie shook his head. A werewolf was a monster. Why were they all so concerned, he could not figure out.\u201cGo clean your weapon,\u201d the Doctor said quietly.Jamie looked down at the dirk still in his hand, dripping red blood. He nodded mutely and went outside to wipe it in the long grass.\u201c\u2019My James\u2019 he said,\u201d James repeated, climbing to his feet and wiping the back of his hand across his face. He looked down at his shirt and tie, horrified by the blood. He gasped.\u201cYes, he did,\u201d the Doctor said. \u201cInspector, do you have anything in the car for your sergeant to change into?\u201dLewis shook his head. He was now sat on the floor beside the other Lewis\u2019 body, his hand on his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean his sergeant, did he?\u201d James clarified, looking at the floor, anywhere but Lewis, the Doctor, the body of the wolf, or, indeed, his own bloodied shirt.\u201cNo,\u201d the Doctor replied gently, \u201che didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOh, and you can be sure can you?\u201d Lewis spat out.The Doctor shrugged.\u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like that. The way he looked at me. As a wolf. He loved me! He wouldn\u2019t have hurt me any more than-\u201d\u201cI would,\u201d Lewis completed. \u201cNo. I suppose not. I\u2019m sorry lad, I\u2019m so sorry James. To us it just looked like he was going to kill you. He was an animal.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d James said, looking away. He walked away towards the fire. After a while of James looking into the fire, Robbie sat by his alternative self\u2019s corpse, the Doctor stood in the middle, hearing the men\u2019s loud thoughts although he didn\u2019t want to, Hathaway spoke again, his voice dripping with all the sarcastic tones his public school cut glass rich brown voice could give, \u201cSo what do we do with it now Sir?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I suppose I should call UNIT. Or Innocent and she can call them.\u201d Lewis stood up and looked at the Doctor. \u201cWhat will they do to him? Will he change back when the sun rises?\u201dThe Doctor shook his head sadly. \u201cI very much doubt he will change now. He\u2019s dead, so stays in the form he was at death. At least, in my limited experience, that\u2019s how it works. As for UNIT, I realise I\u2019m not supposed to know a future me will work for them as a scientific advisor, but it hasn\u2019t been too hard to overhear.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we were told...\u201d\u201cThat I shouldn\u2019t know my own future. No, I shouldn\u2019t, so I want no details. The fact I might chose to settle on Earth and have a job alarms me, and I absolutely must know no more!\u201d He looked up to see Jamie had returned and was hovering awkwardly in the doorway. He supposed the dark of night and the light of a fire was not an uncomfortable, unfamiliar, thing to Jamie. He beckoned him over as he continued to speak to the detectives, \u201cHaving said that, what have you heard of them Inspector? Do you think they will dispose of the body or want to use it to understand shape shifting?\u201dHathaway snorted. \u201cTake a guess Doctor, we\u2019re talking about scientists and the military!\u201dLewis nodded to the Doctor. \u201cAs my clever sergeant says.\u201d\u201cWe could call in the RSPCA,\u201d Hathaway suggested. \u201cFix our report so it was just an escaped wolf.\u201dLewis shook his head,\u201d No!\u201d he snapped vehemently, \u201cI want his remains treated with respect. I\u2019m the closest thing that... he... that Robert Lewis has in this entire universe to family. I want him buried with respect. This had to happen. He killed a man. We couldn\u2019t have put a werewolf in prison, so UNIT would have got him alive, and God knows what they would have done to him. I\u2019ve heard Jamie, I\u2019ve read what he said under caution, you can\u2019t control your time machine in our universe Doctor, much less take him home, whatever you promised. I saw you cross your fingers behind your back.\u201d\u201cI would have tried. There are planets in our universe where people like him have a civilisation. I would have found him a home.\u201d\u201cAway from his Val? His James? Both? Away from his kids, man! No. He\u2019d have gone more mad than he was going, if he\u2019d not killed himself he\u2019d have drunk himself into an early grave within years. It\u2019s better this way. For him.\u201d Lewis\u2019 voice was thick with emotion; the Doctor noticed there were tears in the man\u2019s eyes. He was about to suggest a plan when Lewis\u2019 phone rang. The inspector pulled the phone from his pocket and looked at it,\u201cIt\u2019s your phone Hathaway?\u201d he said, confused.\u201cJamie has it,\u201d Hathaway replied, mystified.Jamie looked at the men and patted his sporran and shook his boot. \u201cI must have dropped it,\u201d he apologised, feeling worried.\u201cOoh, for goodness sakes!\u201d snapped the Doctor, and snatched the phone from the Inspector\u2019s hand and answered it. \u201cHello. Inspector Lewis\u2019 phone. Oh! Hello Zoe. Where are you...?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d just found her when you all called me,\u201d Jamie said to the two detectives. He looked only at Lewis; he could not bear the sorrowful accusation in the sergeant\u2019s eyes. He felt worse than ever as he listened to the Doctor talk to Zoe, give her the address and directions and then explain they had found the murderer, but he was dead, that Jamie had killed him, but it had all been a horrible misunderstanding.*\u00a0When Zoe arrived she found Lewis squatting over the carcass of a dead wolf and he and the Doctor arguing, seemingly about how and where the body should be buried, and with what ceremony. Inspector Lewis was uncharacteristically distressed, or at least from what she had previously observed of the dour, grumpy, but very kind and gentle, older man. There seemed to be a choice between treating it as an animal or an alien to be handed over to UNIT. Inspector Lewis did not feel comfortable with either, and the Doctor apparently did not trust UNIT not to experiment upon the wolf to find what he was calling a \u2018shift trigger\u2019 gene. Zoe remembered how honourable Lethbridge Stewart had been during that business with IE and the Cybermen when they had been on Earth in the 1960s, and how committed to protecting the planet his newly formed UNIT had been. Still, she knew how any organisation could become corrupted and in what was a space of what felt like a few months for her, for UNIT it had been around forty years. No doubt Lethbridge Stewart had retired... or worse! Oh, how time travel could be so hurtful on a personal level as well as confusing at times. People she knew and liked were either dead and buried or not yet born, or even one or the other millions upon millions of unimaginable light-years away from where and when she stood here!She looked again at the wolf; Lewis sat beside it as keeping watch. It did look rather like the beast she thought she had seen in the twilight in Deadman\u2019s Walk, almost two days ago now. Now Lewis was insisting on waiting until the dawn to see if the body \u2018changed\u2019. Change into what? She didn\u2019t feel as if she could interrupt an intense discussion between the Doctor and the inspector, so looked for Jamie in the gloom.Jamie was hunched up in one corner, looking very miserable and unhappy. The sergeant was on the floor on the wall by the door, just beside her, although he hadn\u2019t appeared to notice her, staring at the floor as he was. He was covered in blood, none his own she was glad to note. A fire burned in the middle of the floor, casting the only light, a roasted foul on a spit cast aside by the fire. It was all very peculiar.The Doctor and Lewis had returned to their original topic of discussion. Zoe listened, confused, and tried to summarise the problems in her own mind. The RSPCA would burn the wolf. But if Lewis called it in directly to his boss, Chief Superintendent Innocent, she would call UNIT and who knew what they might do? The Doctor argued back that he did already know of UNIT, he had encountered them in the sixties, but he was trying not to remember the fact that was supposed to be hidden, that in the future, his personal furture, he would work for them, as that means he must at some personal future point settle on earth, and he couldn\u2019t imagine settling down anywhere, ever! He was getting quite animated with this fact.\u201cAye, you said before Doctor,\u201d Jamie said curtly. Oh dear, had they had a tiff? Zoe wasn\u2019t keen on being around the two of them when they had one of their rare disagreements. Or anywhere near their bedroom in the TARDIS when they made up. She resolved to go for a long swim in the pool followed by a long read in the library when they got back home to the TARDIS.Lewis stood up abruptly, but he didn\u2019t notice Zoe, no one had yet noticed her and she was unwilling to interrupt, hidden in the shadows caused by the flickering fire. She was still uncertain on what she had in come on. The Doctor had explained briefly on the phone, but a werewolf, a man from another universe whom was also Inspector Lewis; it was two illogical pieces of a puzzle. She knew all about multiple universes stacked on one another, the theory of it, of course, but it was just another interesting quantum physics puzzle, not a fact! As for the myths, legends, and stories of werewolves, well! That was what they were; fairy stories.\u201cRight,\u201d Inspector Lewis said as he stood, \u201cif the choices are treating Robbie as an animal to be disposed of or a scientific curiosity to be dissected, I\u2019m going to sit here watching over him til dawn, and if doesn\u2019t change I will damn well bury him myself, with honour.\u201dJamie pushed away from the wall and stood straight, looking directly at the inspector. \u201cAye. Good plan. I will gladly help you bury him with honour Robbie. We\u2019ll need to clear the grass and weeds and dig a deep grave. We have all night while you keep vigil over your kin.\u201dLewis nodded slightly to Jamie, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI do have my doubts he will change Inspector. But burying what looks from a distance to be a big dog in a back garden will not alarm any neighbours,\u201d the Doctor said, then he turned, \u201cHello Zoe. Have you been there long?\u201dZoe took a step forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry, I didn\u2019t like to interrupt.\u201d\u201cThank you for your discretion,\u201d the Doctor said, as Jamie came up to Zoe to pat her shoulder,\u201cI\u2019ve been fair worried about ye.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up.\u201dMeanwhile, Hathaway stumbled to his feet. Shock was setting in now, and he felt cold all over. The blood had dried on his shirt, stiffening it a little. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the torches from the car, Sir. It sounds like the best plan, given the circumstances. I\u2019m sure there must be a spade or two about this old house somewhere. I noticed an old garden shed at the bottom of the garden as we came in. And there is that old lean-to by the kitchen door. Both might have any number of gardening implements. I\u2019ll dig the other Robbie Lewis\u2019 grave.\u201d\u201cAye. And I\u2019ll help.\u201dJames and Jamie stared at each other. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jamie said, \u201cthere was no other way. It looked as if he were going to eat you.\u201dJames\u2019 ducked his head and then looked up sadly. \u201cYes, I do understand how it seemed to all of you. And he had already killed a man. Perhaps as Inspector Lewis says, it is the best thing. He\u2019s at peace now. I don\u2019t think he had been, since he arrived here.\u201d\u201cNo James, I don\u2019t he was,\u201d the Doctor said gently. \u201cZoe, why don\u2019t you go with the sergeant to find the lights from the car. Jamie, you find the best place to dig the grave.\u201d\u00a0*\u00a0James didn\u2019t say much to Zoe, only turning to her as he lifted the car\u2019s boot lid to enquire as to whether she had enjoyed her museum trips, to which she had replied,\u201cOh! Who cares! It sounds like you have all had quite an adventure!\u201d\u201cAdventure?\u201d Hathaway repeated dryly. \u201cYes, I suppose you could call it that. Having everything one believes about the world and one\u2019s beliefs turned upside down within 36 hours, ending with a man who looked like your boss declare undying love before changing into a wolf and leaping onto you and pinning you to the floor. Yes, I would think that qualifies as an adventure. One I much prefer in book form, happening to a fictional protagonist, thank you very much!\u201dZoe reached out to touch the policeman\u2019s arm, but checked the impulse as she noticed his slight flinch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be flippant. Travelling with the Doctor shows us all sorts of wonders and adventures. I didn\u2019t see what you all saw, so I\u2019m struggling to understand.\u201d\u201cBut you did Zoe. That wolf is the man you chased, the thing you saw bent over the body. The man, the beast, the wolf \u2013 all Robbie Lewis from another dimension. If a Catholic Cambridge theologian can get my head around that, then I\u2019m sure you can.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. I know about the theoretical possibility of parallel universes, of course.\u201d\u201cSo do we, this end of the twenty-first century,\u201d Hathaway said, even more dryly.\u201cI know. I keep thinking about my grandmother, she lived somewhere near Oxford. She is still alive, a young woman in fact.\u201d\u201cPerhaps the Doctor would let you visit her?\u201d\u201cOh no, he wouldn\u2019t let me do that. It\u2019s a paradox, you see. Or something to do with the timelines, anyway. Oh! I\u2019m not explaining myself, and I usually do explain things well.\u201dHathaway shrugged. \u201cShe needn\u2019t know you are granddaughter from the future, need she? Here, take these, we can put up this arc-light and have a torch each.\u201d Hathaway handed Zoe the large lamp while he piled four torches into the crook of his arm.\u201cIf you have this large arc-light,\u201d Zoe waved the light at the sergeant, \u201cDo you need all the torches?\u201d\u201cThe more light the better,\u201d he replied calmly. It was then Zoe noticed the tremor in his hand. She had seen it before, in many people who encountered the Doctor, especially after the Cybermen last time she had been on Earth. \u201cCome one,\u201d she said gently, \u201clet me take a couple of torches too. You lock up the car and follow me in. I think you could do with a moment alone.\u201dAs soon as she walked back to the burn out house she heard the strike of a light and smelt a nasty smell. She turned back to see him leaning on the car, smoking, inhaling the cigarette deeply. She had studied nicotine addiction in history. But, if it helped him right now, who was she to stop him and point out the dangers of addiction and lung tissue damage.\u00a0*\u00a0When James returned, two cigarettes later, he found Jamie had hung the arc lamp and two torches from the trees at the bottom of the garden and was currently hacking at the long grass with a pair of long gardening shears. Two spades and a rake were propped up by the arc light.\u201cI made a start,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cFeel a wee bit better now? Must be all a shock for ye, I forget, the strange life we have, that this is all new to other people.\u201d\u201cFine. Thanks,\u201d James replied, a little tersely. He took off his jacket and hung it on a bush then picked up the rake. \u201cI\u2019ll clear this lot then,\u201d he said.\u00a0*While James and Jamie dug by flashlight and Robbie sat vigil by his alternative self, Zoe took the spare flashlight and explores. Upstairs she found a pile of blankets making a bed; a suit jacket lay on the top end as a pillow, and so she called the Doctor and Lewis to come upstairs. She was sure the Doctor would want to see what she had found, and somehow, from what she had overheard when she arrived, felt certain that Inspector Lewis needed to see it.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked the Doctor, calling up the stairs.\u201cDo come. And bring the Inspector. He really needs to see this.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Lewis called loudly; Zoe guessed he had pushed the Doctor out of the way at the bottom of the stairs.\u201cA bed. And possessions. Do come. There are...\u201d Zoe hadn\u2019t finished her sentence before she heard the thump of feet on the bare wooden staircase. \u201c...pictures,\u201d she finished quietly as the Doctor shouted above her quieter voice,\u201cCareful Inspector! Take care, the fire may have caused structural damage.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being careful,\u201d Lewis called from the top of the stairs, standing on the landing, looking into the room where Zoe stood beside the pile of musty bedding. Zoe swung her torch back to the wall and towards the photos she had found.On the wall were taped three tiny almost passport sized pictures; one was of Robbie and Val smiling together, one of Val and Mark on a beach, one of Lyn in her nurses uniform, and one of James and a baby. Lewis stepped forward and brushed the pictures of his wife, his children, with his fingertips, before his finger hovered, puzzled, over the other James and a baby. Was he Godfather? Stepfather? Had they adopted? Would he want a second family, at his time of life? He couldn\u2019t imagine his James, this universe\u2019s James, wanting to be a father. He stepped aback and pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and opened it to show Zoe and the Doctor the same three photos, not, of course, including the one of James. The Doctor looked at Zoe, but she couldn\u2019t understand what he meant, what he was trying to relay to her. This alternative, parallel, universe reality was frankly too confusing and frightening to know what to think. She needed to ask the Doctor the physics of it once they were back at the TARDIS. She watched and listened as the Doctor made soothing noises and promised some form of explanations later. Zoe left them to their stilted conversation and searched the jacket, being used as a pillow. She found two wallets, the first containing an empty space where the pictures went, Euros not pounds Stirling and bank cards from a bank that ceased trading 20 years ago, Inspector Lewis said, confused, as he came to stand over her, realising what she was doing. She passed it too him. It was identical to the one he had taken out of his own pocket, battered, elderly, brown leather with a beer stain on the bottom right corner. The second contained the warrant card. Adjudicator Secular Inspector Lewis. Zoe and Lewis both looked to the Doctor, confused. He snatched the warrant card from their hands.\u201cAh, I thought as much. Judicial murder, Inspector. He arrested, tried and convicted Mr Marsh as a violent assailant and abuser, possibly even a murderer\u201d\u201cWhat the...?\u201d Lewis began. \u201cYou mean, like Judge Dredd?\u201d he asked, not knowing quite whether to believe the Doctor. He was some form of werewolf and some kind of policeman with the powers of trial, and even execution. He doubted he could live with that!While the Doctor tried to explain a little more about his theory of how the other universe conducted justice, Zo\u00eb continued to search the jacket pockets. She also found an unfamiliar item that looked half way between a smart phone and a tablet of this half of the century, they kind of thing she knew well from museums and old people \u2013 its battery was dead and she didn\u2019t know the logo, and when she showed it to Lewis he confirmed that the company logo was unknown. Lewis looked at the charge point, confused, so Zoe doubted they could fire it up. The Doctor, of course, had to say he could see what he can do. Zoe, however, wasn\u2019t sure they should know, or at least, this Robbie Lewis should not know, what it contained in terms of information. It could be case notes, a personal diary, more pictures and family photos, and who knew how more confusing and emotionally difficult that could be for the inspector.\u201cI hope you can. I want to know about this man he chased to get here. And what kind of policeman he was, exactly? And if his Val is alive? And what James was to him, exactly?\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d says the Doctor, \u201cI think you know the answer to that Inspector. As for this role as a policeman, he may have felt it his duty to take the law into his own hands and mete out justice. He obviously had worked out he was in the wrong universe. I think he did not thin much of your own force, law and customs, from what he said to us \u2013 to the sergeant! The victim had certainly harmed many people.\u201d Just then it began to get light, as the first brightening and lightening of the sky began in the east. They ran downstairs, but the body remained a wolf. Just then, James and Jamie returned, covered in mud, dust, sweat and grass pollen and burrs.\u201cWe\u2019ve dug the grave for ye kin, Robbie,\u201d Jamie said. James stood behind him, pale and exhausted, still covered in the blood of the other Robbie. He nodded to Lewis, who looked at him thoughtfully, before seemingly throwing off whatever thought he had had concerning his sergeant. He looked back down at the dead wolf, at Robbie Lewis,\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Lewis said.\n", "9": "\nChapter Text\nIt was gone eight o\u2019clock that morning by the time the five of them piled into Lewis\u2019 car, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe squashed in the back, Zoe taking the middle, slight and slender as she was. All were tired, Hathaway still covered in blood - sweat, mud, and dust on his stained shirt too now, after a night\u2019s grave digging. All were quiet. Robbie had wanted something said, and he had looked to James, who had been horrified at first, and then, since no one objected nor mocked \u2013 apart from a slight mutter about papacy under Jamie\u2019s breath, which had been silenced by a swat on his arm by the Doctor \u2013 he had read the rites for a man from another universe who had become a wolf and been killed, a man who nonetheless had been Robert Lewis.As they approached Folly Bridge, Lewis sighed, \u201cAh, we\u2019re all a mess aren\u2019t we? But I\u2019m going to have to log this somehow.\u201dHe turned the car into the station car park. He left them in the car park after he\u2019d parked, squaring his shoulders and reassuring Hathaway he would deal with Innocent. The Doctor scuttled after him,\u201cInspector, let me...\u201d he called.The other three watched them go.\u201cI don\u2019t think Inspector Lewis wants anyone to dig the wolf up,\u201d Zoe said thoughtfully. \u201cHow will he protect the body if he tells the truth?\u201d\u201cHe said he\u2019d say it was an escaped wolf,\u201d Hathaway said numbly, as he lit his cigarette. \u201cBut there will be records. Unless he lets Innocent believe it was an illegal wild animal collection.\u201d\u201cThe Doctor will sort it,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s all get ourselves a drink and something to eat. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but I\u2019m fair famished.\u201d\u201cAnd hopefully the sergeant has a change of clothes here,\u201d Zoe said.Hathaway looked down at his blood stained shirt, which had been a clean pale pink the previous morning. He flicked his half smoked cigarette away and sighed. \u201cYes. I\u2019m going to have a shower. Here,\u201d he took his wallet from his pocket and gave it to Zoe, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much money from here you have. There\u2019s a very nice French patisserie up the road, opposite Christchurch College. Could you get breakfast for five? They do a good English range too. I know the Inspector will want a bacon roll, and if you could get me a sausage sandwich. Tea for Lewis, coffee for me.\u201d\u201cFine. Come on Jamie, you can help. And tell me what you want. I know the Doctor will want a few sweet French patisserie cakes and coffee.\u201d\u201cAye, that he will. Sweet tooth, the Doctor. But never give him coffee Zoe, it fair messes with his mind, makes him more bouncy that ever! Best get him tea.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll meet in the Inspector\u2019s office,\u201d Hathaway called after then, as they began to walk to the car park exit, before ducking his head and hurrying into the station, hoping he didn\u2019t meet too many people; he didn\u2019t want rampant gossip about his shirt covered in bright red arterial blood if it could be avoided. He wrapped his less stained jacket about him and braved the walk through to his locker and the shower rooms.When all five were back at the station, sat on desks or chairs, squashed in the Lewis\u2019 tiny office, the Doctor tried his best to explain to Lewis and Hathaway \u2013 and to Zoe and Jamie \u2013 all which had happened. Lewis seemed somewhat shell-shocked still, and had struggled to keep it together in front of the Chief, but the effort of managing it had left him exhausted and unable to hide his conflicted, confused, emotions anymore. He had, after all, met another version of himself and had watched the other him change into a wolf, seemingly attack his sergeant, and then be killed. It had been a hell of a night; that was for sure. He needed to know what the other Lewis was, where he had come from, why he had been here, and especially, why he had felt the need to kill that two-bit heavy after he had evicted and hurt his adopted neighbours in this universe. Back in the early eighties that house had been a lovely one, ideal location, good neighbourhood, way beyond the price range of a detective constable and his young heavily pregnant wife, staying at home to care for one little toddler already. Besides, there were other questions. The other wallet and warrant card burnt holes in his pocket. He pulled out the wallet again; he had put back the pictures from the wall by the makeshift camp bed. He ran his finger over the creased image of Val, identical in every way to his, before looking at the one of Hathaway, so obviously Hathaway, and yet not, for this one had allowed his hair to grow a bit, instead of shaved back to nothing, he had soft yellow curling short hair in a fifties style quiff. He was dressed in a baggy tee shirt, it was hard to see, but Lewis could imagine it probably had some band or festival slogan on it, if this James was like his.His! What was he thinking?The baby was maybe six months old, a little girl if the pink dress and white cardigan was to go by, but who knew, different universe, different rules? She had scant hair, but what there was seemed to be white blonde, a little pink ribbon tied in a tiny bow around one tuff. Where had she come from? Was she James\u2019 child? His even? He couldn\u2019t imagine James married. Well, to a woman! Who knew what was possible in the other Oxford? That the child was theirs, that they had adopted a baby, he was scared to think about it, because if he did, he would have to acknowledge how attractive the prospect was, not so much parenthood all over again, but James and him, him and James, James being his...Hell!\u201cI still don\u2019t get why he got here. How? I mean, did he fall down a rabbit hole or walk into a wardrobe? Is all that stuff real?\u201d Lewis suddenly interrupted the Doctor\u2019s babble about the entire multiverse, realities stacked upon each other, each varied to a greater or lesser degree, where a different choice had been made, by countries, religions, by leaders, and individuals. He had to interrupt his own thought process, interrupting the Doctor was just a side effect, but judging by Jamie\u2019s face he had made a good call!The Doctor spoke over both Zoe and Hathaway\u2019s scoffing noises to Lewis\u2019 question, \u201cWho knows Inspector, perhaps these writers were visionaries, or even had experience, I\u2019ve always wanted to meet the Rev Charles Dodgson again and ask him...\u201d\u201cAye, we didna stay long, did we? Wee Victoria didna like him much, but what has that strange professor got to do with these other places?\u201d\u201cHe wrote a book Jamie. Two. Well, many actually, but all the others were maths, and not many people read them -\u201d\u201cI have!\u201d interrupted Zoe with a proud smile.The Doctor gave her an annoyed look and went on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cHe called himself Lewis Carroll when he wrote his story books.\u201d\u201cOh. I\u2019ve read the Alice books, strange, nightmarish worlds, more like the land of fiction than what the Doctor is talking about,\u201d Jamie said happily, finally grasping the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s like, somewhere, there is a universe where we won the Battle of Culloden, where the Bonny Prince was made King, where there is no Britain, only Scotland and England...\u201d\u201cAnd from that there would have been no British Empire?\u201d Hathaway mused, listening in.\u201cOr the strength to withstand Hitler?\u201d added Zoe. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard Jamie, but historically I do think Britain is better united.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that if you experienced what I did Zoe!\u201d\u201cBut Jamie,\u201d Zoe laughed, \u201cthat was hundreds of years ago to me, even here and now!\u201dJamie scowled and bit into his ham and cheese roll.\u201cCan we get back to the subject please?\u201d Lewis asked with a sigh, rubbing at his tired eyes before scratching the back of his neck. He felt he could sleep for a week.\u201cOf course Robbie,\u201d the Doctor said gently, seeing how tired, confused and overwhelmed the man was. \u201cSergeant, why don\u2019t you get your Inspector another cup of tea?\u201dHathaway looked momentarily startled, but nodded and got up. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never so no to a lovely cup of tea,\u201d the Doctor said with a smile. Jamie and Zoe shook their heads. They were still scowling at one another.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can be sure what dragged him through Robbie, but I would hazard a guess that he was pursuing a suspect. I have detected a breach in reality, for want of a better description. I\u2019m really at a loss myself; I\u2019ve not encountered the like before. I first thought it was a fissure in time, but was mistaken.\u201d\u201cMight his smart phone/tablet thing tell us?\u201d Lewis asked.\u201cWell, we can\u2019t charge it, can we, we have no compatible connections here in this reality.\u201d\u201cNo. No, I suppose not. Only, I thought, your TARDIS...?\u201d\u201cWhat do you know of my TARDIS Inspector?\u201dLewis grinned, embarrassed, \u201cNothing, I just thought, you know, it travels in time and space...\u201dThe Doctor looked hard at Lewis for a moment, Zoe and Jamie watched him look, curious at the sudden intense scrutiny. After a few moments the Doctor said, \u201cWell Robbie, I do think this UNIT job is already far too much of my own personal future to try to forget. And yes, I might try something with the TARDIS. In the meantime, your police computer might tell me what I need to know \u2013 I\u2019m looking for any other unusual activity, crimes, reports, and so on,\u201d the Doctor waved his hands for emphasis, then clapped them together and looked at Lewis contemplatively. Jamie did not like the way the Doctor was looking so stood up from his perch on the end of Hathaway\u2019s desk and walked across the short piece of floor to the Doctor, putting a firm hand on his shoulder.Lewis ignored both the appreciative look and the possessive glare, instead turning his chair and hitting the keys to get his screen out of sleep mode, \u201cWhere Doctor?\u201d he asked. \u201cPark Town maybe?\u201d\u201cNo, the locale I traced centred on the Radcliffe Camera and Square, possibly slightly to the south east of it.\u201d\u201cGot something, but it has a bloody D-notice sealing it. Can get you the names of the constables that found it, but they\u2019ve probably been given OS forms already.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt means UNIT stamped it out of the PNC and HOLMES 2 apart from one short notice.\u201d\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\u201cA burnt body. At the very end of Catte Street, just before the High.\u201d\u201cSo they were ahead of us all the while Inspector?\u201d\u201cLooks like it, aye. Here\u2019s James. Ta pet,\u201d Lewis reached out to take the tea, then realised what he\u2019d said as two bright pink spots emerged on his cheeks. \u201cSorry sergeant, pay no attention, I\u2019m tired.\u201dHathaway blushed slightly too, and looked down, ducking his head, hiding his face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine Sir.\u201dNeither police officer noticed the look of triumph pass between Jamie and the Doctor.Lewis didn\u2019t acknowledge his sergeant, he didn\u2019t trust himself. Instead, after taking a sip of his tea, he turned back to his computer,\u201cRemains discovered by PCs Blandings and Marr at 1647 on 9th May this year, following two separate reports of a college porter, a waiter at the Vaults, and a tour guide, to the effects that a man, quote, \u2018appeared out of nowhere and burst into flames\u2019. Two response vehicles sent to calm crowds and UNIT showed up at 1751 and took over. D-Notices issued, statement regarding a magical illusion/street art gone wrong put out on TVP facebook and twitter feeds at 1800, same notice issues to all local papers\u2019 websites by 1830. And a order to report all similar cases to be directed to Tower of London; UNIT Europe control. All there is Doctor.\u201d\u201cI suspected as much. Oh, hello again,\u201d the Doctor looked up to see the Chief Superintendent at the doorway.\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Lewis asked, looking up.\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be gone Lewis, two days off in lieu of last night, remember?\u201d she said as she walked into the already crowded small office space and nodded to the Doctor, \u201cAnd as for the Doctor, I really think he should be gone. I have a UNIT operative on her way to interview me, and I really think you shouldn\u2019t be here then, should you?\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am, what will you say?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Lewis, it\u2019s all under control.\u201d She glanced over Lewis\u2019 shoulder and nodded, as if not surprised, \u201cAs you can see, I have a good back story for a rogue wolf here.\u201d She then turned to Hathaway, \u201cGood work sergeant, I hear you tackled the wolf.\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201dFortunately Innocent didn\u2019t see the Doctor behind her, putting his fingers to his lips and winking,\u201cIt\u2019s fine Ma\u2019am. Thank you. All in the heat of the moment. Didn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d\u201cGood job. And you, Mr McCrimmon, thank you for saving my officer.\u201d\u201cNo problem. Ma\u2019am,\u201d Jamie added, confused, as this smart, older woman seemed to call for the title of respect. He had met many women in the future in command, and it was still a strange thing from his point of view, but he couldn\u2019t argue with this one\u2019s command and authority.\u201cRight Lewis, get everyone out of here. I don\u2019t expect to see you or James back here for 48 hours. Clear?\u201d\u201cYes indeed,\u201d Hathaway nodded, as Lewis just said tiredly, rubbing at his sore eyes again,\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\u00a0*They dropped the Doctor off at his TARDIS at his request, before going on to Lewis flat for more food and rest. The Doctor watched Lewis\u2019 car negotiate the narrow cobbled street of Merton, before turning into Dead Man\u2019s Walk and towards his TARDIS.He didn\u2019t stay long, merely managed to find the appropriate connection for Adjudicator Secular Lewis pocket padd, plug it in, and find a scanner that should detect any multi-dimensional as well as temporal fissures, plus the Rassilon\u2019s Lock device attached to the TARDIS that its mostly ignored Instructions informed him were always installed to seal such breaches. If earlier Time Lords had been more vigilant, the Doctor mused as he scanned the book, then perhaps the likes of the Great Intelligence and the Animus would not have posed such a problem for him and his companions. Dear Barbara and Ian, he had not given them a thought in such a long time. If they were still alive, they would be elderly now. Were they still together? Did they marry? He always hoped they had.Pockets brimming with devices, he left for the corner of the High and Catte Street. Just to make sure.\u00a0*\u00a0The Doctor arrived at Lewis\u2019 flat in Marsden some three hours later. In the meantime, Lewis had had a shower, and a good sleep, Zoe had dozed on the sofa in front of the TV, Jamie had just watched TV while knocking back some rather nice bottles of ale and nibbling on biscuits, and Hathaway, twitchy with nervous energy and metaphysical and theological questions buzzing in his brain, had cleaned Lewis kitchen for him and prepared a lunch to reheat when the Doctor returned, making in roads in a rather fine bottle of Merlot Lewis had been keeping for a special occasion while he did so, as well as nipping out of a cigarette every half an hour or so. He meant the Doctor in the street, finishing yet another cigarette, as the Doctor walked up the road. He flicked it away and raised a hand slightly in greeting.\u201cDid you check it was closed?\u201d Hathaway demanded, having guessed what the Doctor had wanted.\u201cIf you mean the doorway to the Adjudicator\u2019s dimension, then yes Sergeant, I have. I picked up a very slight residual energy signature from some crude time hopper device. My guess is the Adjudicator was chasing his perp down Catte Street in his own dimension, when he activated the hopper, which malfunctioned for some reason, spiralling him out sideways through time rather than backwards or forwards in time. But come on, show me into your Robbie\u2019s flat and I can explain to everyone. I\u2019ve managed to charge his phone, by the way, if you\u2019re interested. Some very lovely pictures on there of the other you I would guess.\u201dOnly the barest of twitches on his left eye gave away Hathaway\u2019s deep discomfort at the thought.Zoe made more tea for everyone, while James made some toast and put his ratatouille, garlic bread and salad in the fridge for later \u2013 the Doctor claimed to be hungry, but rejected the prepared meal \u2013 while Robbie, the Doctor, and Jamie squashed on the sofa desperate to look at the smart phone thing of the other Lewis. The Doctor, however, was reluctant to open it. The screen\u2019s wallpaper, however, was a picture of James, in a grey morning suits, smiling a wide, happy, smile it was hard for Robbie to imagine his sergeant ever smiling. Both he, and James, who was suddenly peering over his shoulder, wanted desperately to know what the other James was to the other Robbie. Robbie was the one to ask, after a demanding look from his sergeant. The Doctor smiled sweetly, and said mischievously that he was sure they could figure that one out for themselves, that it really didn\u2019t even just have to just apply to that universe. Then he just flipped his thumb up the screen and watched for the encryption options to appear.\u201cPassword?\u201d he asked, glancing at Robbie.\u201cHow the hell do I know?\u201dThe Doctor glared at him.Lewis sighed and plucked the phone from the Doctor\u2019s hand, and, with first try, unlocked the device. He began to scroll through options, looking at the personal and work folders. It was far more advanced than a smart phone, more like a tiny laptop, but the folders and files didn\u2019t seem too far removed from Windows. That universe also had a bill Gates, obviously...Meanwhile, Zoe was keeping everyone else occupied. She sat on the floor in front of the Doctor and let all that had been bothering her pour out while Lewis, unnoticed, devoured the files ion the phone. She had been musing for hours with no opportunity for explanations and question, ignored and alone at the flat, not that James or Jamie would have had the answers anyway. Everyone else had been occupied or asleep and the Doctor who knew where, so the problems and questions had grown in her mind, infuriating and frustrating her. She had bigger problems with the myths of werewolves, how the Adjudicator Lewis did not fit with all the mythology, it wasn\u2019t quite a full moon, and didn\u2019t take silver to kill him, that it had sounded as if he was a hurting, afraid, mentally ill, human, alone in a strange world, not a monster at all.\u201cExactly what he was, Zoe, exactly what he was,\u201d the Doctor said at the end of her long, confusing, tirade of questions, beaming at her like a proud teacher that his long struggling pupil had finally understood and cracked the problem.Lewis suddenly interrupted Jamie, who had been about to tease Zoe for her over-thinking things again, as he wondered aloud how he would have coped in their universe. Would they have smelt he was different? The Doctor turned to look at Lewis, remembering he had the pocket padd and access, and folded his hand over it, his fingers brushing Lewis\u2019 strong, calloused ones. He momentarily wondered again about his future, this man\u2019s past, as Lewis looked up from the phone and into his eyes, bright dark blue eyes twinkling. \u201cI mean, well, it seems they would have had such a strong, developed, sense of smell, being part wolf. He uses smell as an accredited form of evidence in some notes,\u201d Lewis explained, his own fingers of his left hand gently removing the Doctor\u2019s hand, his right hand tightening on the phone.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much I can help Inspector,\u201d the Doctor replied, reaching for the phone, but spotting Jamie\u2019s jealous scowl at the finger play and hand caressing and changing his mind. The inspector had a right to it, he supposed. Any advanced technology from the other universe was unlikely to be used here, providing he could take it with him to the TARDIS when they left. I\u2019m not sure if they were all Wolfbloods in that dimension, or just some people, but obviously they were fully integrated into that society and not on its margins, if, as you say, their heightened senses were admissible in court.\u201d\u201cWhat about him? The other Lewis? Could he have settled here? I doubt it, |I really do.\u201d James said, coming and sitting on the arm of the sofa next to his inspector.\u201cWell, \u201c replied the Doctor gently,\u201d although, if we could have calmed him before Jamie\u2019s timely intervention, if the good Inspector had allowed him, I would have risked a good deal to try to move the TARDIS sideways and take him home, but sadly my own people would not allow that, travelling through the multiverse is strictly prohibited.\u201d Zoe scoffed, \u201cWhen has that ever stopped us before...?\u201dJamie, meanwhile was intrigued by his lover\u2019s mention of his own people, it was only the second time he had known the Doctor do so, acknowledge he had a people, a place, a planet, and hadn\u2019t sprung, fully formed, with his TARDIS, alone in the universe, to fight evil and free oppressed people!\u201cZoe, there are things you don\u2019t understand, some things I can\u2019t do,\u201d the Doctor said gently, as Lewis said,\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s a mute point. He\u2019s dead and buried now. And probably better for him.\u201d\u201cHow will you protect his grave, his body?\u201d Zoe asked.\u201cYes, I want to know that. How do you know Innocent won\u2019t just give UNIT his location?\u201d Hathaway added.\u201cBecause she won\u2019t. For starters, she doesn\u2019t know where the incident happened, the Doctor and I were... creative with the address.\u201d\u201cAnd we said we had burned the body,\u201d the Doctor added.Lewis went on to explain that Innocent had agreed to tell UNIT that it turned out to be a genuine wolf escaped from a private owner in the Cotswolds and it had made it\u2019s home with a homeless man squatting in the row of houses that were occupied by squatter who unlawfully evicted by the new owners. Once the wolf had killed one man, it had then turned on the one looking after it. She knew they will look into it, but hopefully the body would be left in peace.\u201cOf course, they won\u2019t believe her in her debrief, so she will then say that the wolf belonged to the man who came through the portal they had already detected and tried to shut down, the charred remains of the alien they took away,\u201d the Doctor added.\u201cAye. We didn\u2019t have those facts until after the meeting, but it was obvious she knew about the body at Catte Street in May,\u201d Lewis finished.\u201cYou told her everything?\u201d Hathaway asked, surprised.\u201cAlmost everything lad,\u201d Lewis said with a smile, \u201csome things are best not shared, in case they suddenly happen in this universe.\u201dAt that, considering the picture of the other James in the wolf-Lewis\u2019 wallet and on his phone, he looked down shyly, going pink at the tips of his ears and flushing across his cheeks. Robbie had never seen his sergeant blush before. He found he loved it. But he gave it no more thought as he listened to the Doctor, who explained again, this time to everyone, that he had found the echoes of the rip, that it was activated by some alien technology not known on Earth, and unlikely to be known in the other Earth. He suspected Adjudicator Lewis\u2019 suspect was an alien who had tried to shift with an unstable matter interface and fried himself in the process, taking poor Lewis with him. He then managed to snatch the phone from Lewis\u2019 tight grip, and closed down the Adjudicator\u2019s logs and pulled up, instead, personal files, pictures and memories. He held it up to everyone, except poor Zoe, who was seated on the floor in front of him, and showed the photos he had found, of Lewis and Hathaway in matching grey morning suits and top hats, showered in pink confetti, of Robbie and James\u2019 wedding, and then, after a while of a baby girl, including an inexplicable one of a tired James in a hospital bed with a newborn baby. James slipped away, sliding of the arm of the chair, as they looked at the wedding photos, unnoticed as Zoe made a fuss at not being able to see, showing the Doctor and Jamie one of her rare moments when she acted her age, that of a young teenager, and not the series girl from the Wheel, promoted and pushed beyond her age. She parked herself on Jamie\u2019s lap and made happy squealing noises at the photos, smiling as Robbie said, amazed,\u201cThat\u2019s our Lyn,\u201d at one large family grouping. To the first baby snaps, he added, \u201cI thought mebbe she was a grandchild, but it looks like that James and Robbie adopted.\u201dWhen they got to the newborn baby the Doctor tried to explain to the baffled faces about some lupine descended creatures and some lycanthropic ones and males with uteruses, but at that point everyone realised James has already walked out. Lewis got up to go, but the Doctor grabbed his sleeve and shook his head. Instead, with a look from the Doctor, Jamie went. He found James sitting on a low wall at the back of the block of flats, smoking another cigarette, and starring morosely into space. Jamie went and sat beside him.\u201cFoul and expensive thing of the English, in my day,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTobacco.\u201d\u201cOh? I suppose it was.\u201d He carried on starring into space. James had not seen his other self with the newborn; he had left after the wedding photos. Jamie had obviously followed him as he sensed his discomfort. He listened, interested and with more than sympathetic understanding as the strange boy from the past talked about his time and pastors and sins and how he didn\u2019t think there was such superstitious nonsense now, in this time. How he was confused to hear that James was a papist, that there was still a Church of Rome in the British Isles, he thought the English had less love if it that the Scots.\u201cI thought your Bonny Prince was supportive Catholic? In fact, I understood you Jacobites to be Catholic rebels.\u201d James sneered.\u201cAye, many of us were,\u201d Jamie sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t hold with superstitious nonsense anymore.\u201d He looked down, and then went on to defend his former leader, changing the subject. \u201cHe was our prince, he would have got rid of all the English landlords and soldiers, given us back our crofts and lands,\u201d Jamie replied tartly. \u201cAncient history to you. To me, my first taste of battle, of blood, or suffering, of monsters, \u2019cept it was you posh English who were the monsters.\u201dJames looked up, he had hung his head for sometime, staring at the bare, cracked concrete, as he smoked. \u201cI can only apologize for my ancestors,\u201d he said, and seemed like he meant it. Jamie softened, remembered he had come to help the skinny, tall, awkward man, not blame him for things he had nothing to do with,\u201cSorry. I lost good people then. But my life would have been fair different if I\u2019d not met the Doctor, that\u2019s for certain, so I don\u2019t regret that.\u201d He then explained how he thought he would have got married but had no idea of love and passion until the Doctor, that Zoe had explained he was made to love men, some men were, and some women made to love women. Sin was hurting people, he was an old-fashioned man, though, and if you loved someone you made a commitment, but the Doctor was as slippery as an eel! But the Bible said sex outside marriage was the sin, right, not love?James looked at Jamie sadly, \u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated than that,\u201d he said.\u201cOnly if you want it to be, only if it make it so,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cCome back in. We found photos of the other you and Robbie\u2019s daughter. A fair, bonny lass they have.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d James wasn\u2019t sure what to think. He had seen the photo, of course, on the wall in the house. The other him, with what he disdainfully thought as gay hair and a baby. But he thought more deeply as he followed Jamie up the stairs, trying to make himself not peek as the lad\u2019s kilt swung about those strong legs, trying not to look up as he went around the landing above him. He thought that the other James was a widower now, with a small baby to raise, alone in that world, if, like him, he was estranged from his own family and Robbie\u2019s children were far away too.They came back in quietly. The Doctor and Zoe were waiting to leave by the door to the living room as they came in. The phone had been put away conveniently into one of  the Doctor\u2019s pockets \u2013 the case notes and file details and access to all agencies on the other Earth was not something that belonged in the Thames Valley Police or UNIT\u2019s hands. Promises had obviously been made to explain more on omegas to Zoe in the TARDIS. They all looked kindly at James, who immediately sat awkwardly down on his place next to Lewis on the sofa, squashed to the left of his boss. The Doctor pointed to the kitchenette, where the TARDIS crew adjourn to make more tea, leaving James and Robbie to talk. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe attempted to leave after putting the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of the two men, who were looking at each other intensely, holding hands. They barely acknowledged them, but then Robbie seemed to grasp what was going on and offered to drive them back to the TARDIS. They climbed out of the car in Oriel drive.\u201cGoodbye,\u201d the Doctor said, shaking both men\u2019s hands vigorously  \u201cAnd good luck to you both.\u201dZoe grinned soppily, \u201cOh yes, good luck and congratulations.\u201d Hathaway scowled deeply at her, but Lewis winked. Jamie shook both men\u2019s hands too, then quickly gave James a hug,\u201cBe happy, not guilty,\u201d he whispered. James nodded slightly, which Jamie took to be a yes. He walked away, calling to the Doctor, who scuttled after him. Zoe turned back and gave both men a huge hug each.\u201cYou\u2019re both so lovely,\u201d she said. She ran to catch up with her travelling companions.James and Robbie stood watching them walk down Merton Street towards Dead Man\u2019s Walk.  The Doctor talking, quite pleased that the Brigadier\u2019s idea had taken off and lasted through the decades, Jamie pleased that Robbie and James seemed to final got together, Zoe annoyed that she missed most of the action\u201cBut you enjoyed your museum trips and your day off, didn\u2019t you Zoe?\u201d the Doctor asked as they entered the TARDIS. The door closed and the TARDIS faded away to a strange wheezing and groaning noise, watched only by a robin sitting on a nearby branch...*The two detectives looked at each other one the strange group of time travellers were no longer in sight. \u201cAlright, bonny lad?\u201d Lewis asked his no longer not quite sergeant. He bumped shoulders with him, as he had on countless times, but this time, he caught hold of Hathaway\u2019s hand and entwined their fingers together, palm pressed to palm. Hathaway gripped back tightly.\u201cYes Sir. Very alright indeed.\u201d\n"}}, "4653177": {"Series:": ",\u00ab ,Part 4 of the ,The Malfoy Connection, series", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Jean Innocent", "Draco Malfoy", "Ron Weasley", "Hermione Granger", "Original Characters"], "Words:": "16807", "Title": "The Case of the Ghostly Guests.", "Rating:": ["Not Rated"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Robert Lewis"], "Fandoms:": ["Lewis (TV)", "Harry Potter - J.

This discussion was making him feel old.\n\"We had Halloween parties,\" he said. \"We told ghost stories and bobbed for apples; my mam used to ice biscuits with little skulls. And there was Mischief Night. Young thugs would go around removing gates, putting sticky stuff on door knockers, that kind of thing; sort of tricks without any treat option. Though in some places I think that was nearer Bonfire Night.\" Draco and James both just stared at him. \nReally old. It wasn't so much a question of magic as of some kind of generation gap that he wasn't usually aware of. They were sitting in the garden of Draco's beautiful and decadent manor house, admiring the roses and chatting in a rather desultory fashion about the cases they'd solved where the wizarding and muggle worlds had collided. \nRobbie had not known about the collision during the case of the disappearing don. It was the beginning of his relationship with James, or rather his new relationship with James, because of course they'd had a work relationship prior to that. He remembered the case fondly for that reason alone \u2013 and for the happy outcome that had meant nobody ended up dead. \nHe had found out in time, during the case of the assassinated aunt. At first he had been - how did it go? 'Bewitched, bothered and bewildered', just like in the song and that old TV show. Though he had to admit that neither James nor his cousin Draco went in for nose-twitching. Then he'd thought maybe magic could be used in police work, but James had disabused him of that notion. No spilling the beans to muggles. There was some kind of retcon thing wizards could do, although Robbie realised retcon was Torchwood fantasy and not quite the reality of the actual wizarding world. They'd used that truth potion to get a confession, but from a witch, not an ordinary member of the public, even a criminal one, and James had grabbed the witch's wand in some bizarre fashion, but... well, and the aurors had removed evidence that could have had them on a charge of police harassment or intimidation, but only because the entire case had been inextricably entwined in the affairs of wizards. \nThey'd reached the case of the Halloween horror and James had recalled Robbie saying it couldn't have happened in the old days because Samantha would never have been out trick or treating. Which, when James had repeated Robbie's remark, had sparked Draco's outburst.\n'Muggles never cease to amaze me,' said Draco, which Robbie thought was rich, coming from a wizard. 'You have weird notions about other festivals, too.'\n'Weird notions?' Robbie could hear the offended note in his voice but couldn't stop it. Here, he was the sole line of defence on behalf of his entire species. He made a mental note to ask James later about species, and whether he had that right. Probably not. \n'Santa Claus.' Draco clearly didn't expect to have to elaborate but Robbie pushed.\n'What about Santa Claus, then?'\n'Encouraging children to think it's fine if an elderly stranger comes into their bedroom and messes with their garments and leaves presents...' Draco sounded genuinely horrified but James was making gasping sounds that were almost certainly suppressed laughter. Robbie tried to explain about Saint Nicholas but Draco seemed to think that was even worse. 'And,' he went on, 'there's that business of rabbits laying coloured eggs.'\nThis time, it was Robbie's turn to laugh. 'That's a modern American idea, too. And I think the rabbit only hands the eggs out. Ordinary chickens lay them and ordinary people colour them. When I was a child...' He stopped, aware that he had been saying that rather a lot, and that it made him sound like some kind of grumpy old man. \n'What did you do at Easter when you were a child?' James sounded interested so Robbie continued.\n'We came down to breakfast to find eggs piled in the centre of the table. Sometimes we'd have helped to colour them, either boiling them with onion skins or painting them with the dyes you can use for cake icing, so they weren't a surprise. Then we'd play at jarping.'\n'Jarping?' The cousins spoke together, sounding startled by the use of what seemed like a foreign word. Perhaps it was. Perhaps only Northumberland and Durham jarped their eggs.\n'We'd all take an egg in our fist and tap each other's. The winner was the one whose egg didn't break or craze. And in theory the winner won the crazed egg. But my mam made us give them back because she wanted everyone to have their fair share. She'd give us a little prize of some kind - maybe chocolate. And then she'd hold some eggs back for Easter Monday. We used to go to Hexham to the egg rolling outside the abbey. The eggs were rolled down a grass slope and again, the winner was the one with their egg or eggs unbroken, or that went furthest.'  \n'Eggs are a symbol of new life, and of resurrection,' mused James. 'They suit the theme of Easter, both the Christian story of the tomb and the pagan stories.'\n'Which are?' said Robbie. He had some half formed ideas but knew James would have in-depth knowledge.\n'Some people say Easter owes its name to Eostre who might or might not have been a pagan goddess but others say it's to do with Easter usually falling in Eosturmonath, the month of opening, buds unfurling, that kind of thing. Whatever, eggs do hatch or open round about Easter if they're left to themselves and not placed in incubators. And a cracked eggshell recalls the cracked opening of the tomb. So: Easter eggs.'\n'And rabbits?' Draco was scornful.\n'The originals might have been hares,' said James. \n'March hares: mad as,' said Robbie, and they all laughed. \nIt was a warm afternoon and Robbie felt wrapped in sunlight and happiness. The manor gardens were beautiful, James and his cousin were good company, and it was Sunday, so work was over for one week and not yet begun for the next. Of course, there could still be an emergency, but he hoped not. \nNo emergencies happened that afternoon apart from a peacock squabble that left some exquisite feathers on the lawn and an atmosphere of avian disquiet but Robbie left Malfoy Manor with a sense of foreboding that had no apparent cause. \n                                                  lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\n'James.' Robbie shook James gently then not so gently.\n'Mm - wha...?'\n'There's an owl at the window. It's pecking the glass. Wake up. '\n'Oh. Well, open the window, then.'\n'What??'\n'Let it in. There are some treats in a box in the cupboard near the cereal.'\n'You can't be serious.'\n'Perfectly serious. Oh, all right.' James, thoroughly awake by now, flung himself out of bed and stomped across to the window, which he opened, allowing cool dawn air to brush goose pimples onto Robbie's skin. The owl, instead of flying off in terror, as Robbie had expected, hopped rather sedately over the sill and sat on the corner of the chest of drawers, looking somehow expectant. \nJames disappeared and Robbie, trying not to stare at the owl, heard rustling in the kitchen. His partner came back with a fistful of something unidentifiable. The owl could obviously identify it very well and gave a small satisfied hoot before tucking into whatever was laid in front of it. While it was eating, James detached a letter which he brought back to bed. It had been written on thin paper of the kind Robbie remembered being used for airmail correspondence, and had been rolled tightly into a tube that had been clipped to the owl's leg. \nRobbie spluttered. 'Owl post? Tell me that isn't real. Tell me I'm dreaming. We do not have an owl gorging itself in our bedroom. You have not just had a letter delivered by owl.'\n'Hm? No, you're not dreaming and yes, this is a letter by owl post. If you stop fretting and let me read it I'll find out why someone is contacting us this way.' Thus effectively silenced, Robbie reverted to contemplating the owl, which had finished its snack and seemed to be waiting for something else. A reply, perhaps? \n'It's from Auror Weasley.' James sounded quite sane and quite wide awake. The owl looked satisfied and hopeful at the same time. \n'Can't he use the phone, like other people?' Robbie was never at his best before 6.00.am and the owl itself contributed to his annoyance but he would have had to admit that a phone call at that hour would have been no more welcome, just perhaps easier to believe. \n'He probably used his owl as a matter of course,' said James. Then he sighed. 'Robbie, wizards use owls the way we use postmen. It's normal - for them.'\n'But James, you're a wizard. Are you telling me we need a pet owl?'\n'No. I contact Draco by phone and I don't communicate with anybody else in the wizarding world at the moment. So no.' \nRobbie wondered if 'at the moment' had really been as loud and reverberating as he thought. Then he found himself considering the vagaries of the UK postal system and wondering if owls might not be an improvement. At that point he gave up thinking altogether and lay back, assuming, correctly, that James would tell him all about the letter if he waited patiently.\n'His wife needs help. Well, not his wife, her parents, and not them, their friends. They live just outside Oxford.'\n'And just how does this involve us and why does it necessitate an owl delivery?'\n'Because they're muggles and because Ron automatically sent an owl with all the details rather than risking me not answering my phone or being unable to talk if I was at work.' James had grabbed a similarly thin piece of paper from his drawer in the bedside table and was scribbling. \n'Do I get to hear the details? And what are you doing?'\n'Saying we'd be delighted to look into the case and inviting them round to talk about it. And yes, I'll tell you the details in a minute. Of course I will!' The last pronouncement was in answer to Robbie\u2019s gasp of indignation. Then James rolled the paper, inserted it into the tube, re-clipped that to the owl's leg and opened the window again. The owl gave a small bow, hopped out and flew off.\n'Are they specially bred owls, or are they just specially trained?' Robbie couldn't believe he was more interested in the postman than the letter but it was only 6.15.am and he was not yet quite in work mode. \n'I have no idea. I'll ask Draco. And no, I don't want one. It would be hard to justify even a small owlery in a house like this and I don't need one anyway.'\nRobbie dismissed ideas of an owl for James' birthday; the thought of an owlery was the clinching factor. \nThey were both completely wide awake by now, and trying to get another half hour's sleep would be pointless. After showering and dressing they faced each other over the breakfast table, early enough to talk about a dozen letters before work. \n'Hermione Weasley,' said James, 'is muggle-born.'\n'Like you?' \n'No, I'm a Malfoy on my mother's side so only half muggle. Hermione's parents were ordinary non-magical people. Dentists. Probably didn't know what had hit them when they produced a magical child and got an invitation for her to go to Hogwarts, never mind all the accidental magic she'd have evinced before then. Stuff they'd have had to explain away. But they coped admirably and Hermione is both extremely intelligent and very well-adjusted. According to Ron. According to Draco she's a bookworm and bossy with it. She works for the Ministry of Magic.'\n'Like Ron and Harry?'\n'Well, yes, but she isn't an auror. She's some kind of researcher and no, I don't know what. But she's in constant touch with her parents, the Grangers. They live somewhere further north, I think, but they have these old friends in Oxford. Not dentists, but university friends, all the same. Dr and Mrs Coates. He's an academic, not a medical doctor. Apparently they moved recently, bought a house beside the river, intended for their retirement. His retirement is looming, though she's likely to work a while longer - teaches, according to this, but in a school, not at the university. Hermione's close to them. And they're having problems with the house.'\n'We're police, not estate agents, James.'\n'Not those kind of problems. They think it's haunted.'\n'Haunted? You're joking, aren't you? I mean, academics who believe in ghosts?'\n'I didn't actually say they believed, but it sounds as if whether they originally did or not they do now. Trouble is, Hermione got Ron to go and check it out and it isn't.'\n'Isn't what?'\n'Haunted. Which is why,' James continued quickly, seeing the look on Robbie's face, 'Ron is asking for our help. There are definitely no ghosts, and yes, ghosts are real and usually just a nuisance, but there aren't any because Ron has checked. So this is some kind of human scam to make them think it's haunted and he wants us to look into it.'\n'Which is all very well, and don't think I won't return to the topic of ghosts later, because I will, but Oxford Police don't investigate mock hauntings unless there's a crime involved.'\n'But you and I could, after work. We'd have a look round, see if we could pick up any clues as to who was doing it and why. Then perhaps Hermione and Ron could frighten them - the haunters, I mean.'\nRobbie sighed. This wizarding business was taking over his life. Well, not really. Months would go past while the nearest it came to him was James' magic practice and the occasional broken plate, or a visit to Malfoy Manor and unseasonal exotic flowers. Then in one morning, before he had intended to be awake, there was an owl delivering post, a check for ghosts, and a threat to frighten whoever was pretending to haunt the house of a friend of a friend of... James.  James, who had only recently learnt of his magical heritage and was trying desperately to fit into both worlds. As well as Robbie's world. \n                                                                lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nHermione sat on Robbie's couch - his and James' couch now - legs curled under her and hands clasped. Ron straddled one of their dining chairs, his arms and chin resting on the back\n'Uncle Matt and Auntie Katie aren't what you'd call impressionable people,' said Hermione. 'He's an engineer of some kind - an academic engineer but still a practical sort of man - and she's a science teacher. If there are things going bump in the night they certainly haven't imagined it, and he'll have investigated properly. Well, as properly as possible.'\n'They're your aunt and uncle?' James clearly hadn't expected that.\n'Not really. Courtesy aunt and uncle.'\nRobbie nodded. Growing up, he had been encouraged to call all his parent's friends aunt or uncle, though James and Ron obviously thought this was an odd idea.\n'I've looked for ghosts,' said Ron. 'There aren't any. Well, not quite true; there's a boy in the boat house who just hangs around dripping on anyone who gets too close, but he doesn't go up to the house, and doesn't know about anyone who does. I've checked for magical signatures of any kind but there's only the kind of background noise you'd expect in an area like this.'\n'Oxford, you mean?' James looked as dubious as Robbie felt. The city had never seemed anything other than worldly, full of ambitious students, even more ambitious lecturers, and a lot of very solid history and architecture. \n'Well, there are wizards at all the main universities,' said Ron. 'They just mind their own business as a rule. You wouldn't notice them.'\n'No,' said Hermione. 'They do research into all kinds of things, but they don't transfigure anyone or anything, and they're a quiet lot, on the whole. The worst they might do is charm an audience at a lecture to get extra applause.'\n'What about their kids?' Robbie had a feeling about this though he wasn't sure yet what kind of feeling it was. \n'The ones with families tend to be quiet, too, and the kids end up going to Hogwarts unless they're squibs. So during term time, at any rate, there won't be many kids around. Only little ones, and whilst some of them might be prone to accidental magic it usually manifests itself around the nursery school paint pots or the swings in the park. I've never heard of younger kids playing at haunted houses. Have you, Ron?' As her husband shook his head she went on. 'Uncle Matt and Auntie Katie haven't got any kids. I'm the closest thing to a relation, I think, and of course that's not a blood tie. My parents are really worried about them; Auntie Katie rings Mum every time there's an incident and she's beginning to sound almost hysterical.'\n'So what form do these incidents take?' If they were going to investigate, Robbie supposed they should do it properly, ask all the right questions from the start, maybe take notes.\n'Banging. Really loud banging, and then doors and windows opening of their own accord. Lights, sudden and moving, and shadows, of course, to go with them. The dustbin overturned and rubbish strewn everywhere - and no, not foxes, because last week there was a chicken carcase and it was still intact. Minus the meat, of course, but that would be because Auntie Katie had got it all off.'\n'Is it an old house?' Maybe there'd be a prosaic explanation in badly fitting or warped frames. And a gust of wind in the yard to make an overturned dustbin join the catalogue of events. \n'Not really. It was, but they had it gutted when they bought it. Brooks and Wood did the conversion and they're supposed to be the best.' \nThey were. If they'd fitted the new doors and windows nothing would be warped, nothing would rattle, and there'd be precious little chance of anyone breaking and entering stealthily, let alone with bangs and crashes caused by draughts or clumsiness. \n'Have either of you heard or seen anything?' Robbie supposed it was too much to hope for.\n'No. Mummy got Auntie Katie to invite us for a weekend, to see if we noticed anything, but nothing happened while we were there. But then apparently nothing happens most weekends; this seems to be a weekday haunting. Or non-haunting. And we can't spend weekdays there on the off-chance.'\n'So they want our help?'\nHermione blushed. 'Not exactly. It's us that are asking for help. They don't know we've asked. We suggested involving the police but Uncle Matt thought it would all sound too odd and as there hasn't been any actual damage yet, the police wouldn't spare anyone to spend time there either.'\n'That's all very well, but unless there's a case we have no authority, and we'd need their permission to poke around.' Robbie could just imagine asking Innocent for blanket permission to investigate a supposed haunting.  \n'I might have told them some friends would look into it for us - Oxford friends,' said Ron, mumbling the words and blushing redder than Hermione. For a moment Robbie could see past the aura of magic and authority and sense how very young these people were. Younger than James, of course. Classmates of Draco's, he thought. And magic was their first recourse when anything was wrong. Since Ron couldn't find anything they would have no idea what to do. He sighed. \n'All right,' he said, 'we'll take a look, and we won't let on that we're police if we can help it. But it'll have to be evenings, and it'd be best if James here was the one you introduced as a friend - more your age group, after all.'\nAll three of his listeners smiled, Hermione and Ron with thanks and James with a mixture of admiration and ruefulness. \n'So,' said Robbie, turning to his partner, 'how are you going to explain me?'\n'Since you're as old as Methuselah?' James had laughter bubbling behind the words. 'You're a great deal younger than Hermione's parents' friends, I imagine, and we give them a judicious helping of truth. You're a colleague and friend, we're civil servants in the daytime, and I've brought you along as an older and wiser head.' \n                                                            lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nIn the end, it wasn't necessary to do anything of the kind, because when they got to the station the next day, Innocent called them to her office with some degree of urgency.  \n'There's a death that needs investigation,' she said. 'Not immediately reported as murder but I have suspicions. Matthew Coates was an Oxford academic and his wife is a friend of mine. Dr Coates went out to see what or who was making a nuisance of themselves in his garden, tripped, and hit his head on a sharp stone in the rockery. He died last night in hospital. It was reported as an accident, but because I know Mrs Coates, she phoned me. They've been having a lot of nuisance at Beeches - that's their home - and she isn't sure whether Matt fell or was pushed, but feels that whoever was out there was responsible for his death. And no, I don't expect you to arrest a fox for manslaughter, but I did promise her we'd see if there were any humans involved. If there were...'\n'...you'd hope the CPS would try to pin manslaughter on the culprits,' said Robbie, ignoring the identity of the victim for the moment.\n'Yes.' Innocent sounded very definite. 'It's time a message went out to society at large. Irresponsible and reckless behaviour endangers lives. Even if the charge didn't stick, the message might.'\n'And your friend would know you'd taken her seriously and done everything you could.'\n'I hope we'd take all complaints seriously, DI Lewis.' But Jean frowned as she spoke. She was skating on thin ice, and she knew it. Her intentions were entirely honourable but given the propensity of the CPS to dismiss cases that were less than cut and dried, she would probably have given less attention to a complaint from someone she didn't know.\nJames was looking interested, smug, satisfied, and altogether too happy about the death of Dr Coates. Well, Robbie amended to himself, not about the death, because he knew James held all life in very high regard, but about the surrounding circumstances that had led to their magical case becoming their police case.  As they left Innocent's office with a promise to do their best, sent on their way with a brisk admonition to get onto it straight away, he decided he agreed with James. This was the perfect solution to the problem of helping their wizarding friends on police time. \n                                                                   lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nBeeches was beautiful. Brooks and Wood had done a sensitive job of restoring it. Everything that could be fixed was clean and new, but the bones of the house stood out, Georgian, probably, old and alluring. The sash windows had been replaced; shutters were visible behind the sparkling glass, tucked carefully into the thick walls of window embrasures. The fanlight over the front door gleamed, lording it benevolently over a brass knocker in the shape of a fox's head. The brickwork was mellow, sunset coloured and perfectly pointed, just as it would have been when the house was first built. The beeches that gave the house its name were opposite the front of the building, across a gravel drive, a lawn and a small stream. There were both ordinary trees with their almost translucent green leaves, and a weeping variety with copper foliage. \nJames and Robbie paused a moment to admire, then attacked the fox, hoping Katie Coates was both in, and willing to talk to them. They hadn't phoned first.\nIt took a few minutes to explain that yes, they really were police officers, sent by Jean Innocent, although they were also the civil service friends Hermione had promised. Since Hermione had at least given their real names it was confusing rather than embarrassing. \n'We couldn't run a proper police investigation before something happened,' said Robbie. 'We didn't want to let Hermione and Ron down, so we offered to come and have a look on our own time. But unfortunately, events got ahead of us.'\n'Well, you're here now so I should be grateful.' Mrs Coates tried to smile but both men could see it was only for politeness' sake. 'Of course, it would have been better if something could have been done while Matt was still alive. It's like those councils that put zebra crossings in after a few people have been killed. Oh, I'm rambling. Take no notice. I suppose you want to see where he fell?'\nThey went out again, into the front garden, along the path under the windows, their feet crunching softly on the gravel. They reached the corner of the house and turned towards the back door, which, as in so many houses was in fact on the side. There were bins - the usual plethora of different colours denoting the things that were allowed, paper and card, bottles of any material plus aluminium trays, garden rubbish, food waste, and ambient - or in other words everything else. There was an old fashioned metal dustbin, too, its lid half off, and its interior clearly used for ash from the fires. Plastic bins didn't allow for hot ash and in any case, it would probably be best kept for the garden. The path widened into a paved yard, with a small kitchen garden off to the side, bounded by what had once been a coach house and stables and were now a garage and shed respectively. The vegetable plot had a low wall, and there was a mounting block in the middle. Someone had tried to scrub it but it was ominously dark. \n'We were in the lounge,' said Mrs Coates. 'We heard the usual fuss, doors, windows, chains rattling and so on. Yes,' she said, noting their expressions, 'it was Hammer House of Horror at times. Overkill, in a way, because it took a while for us to take it seriously. Then we heard the bin lid - the ash can, not the others - and Matt said something about thinking he'd catch them at last. He ran out of the front door and round, the route we've just taken. I stood at the door, you see. I was waiting to hear him shout to me to get the police. Instead, I heard a sort of thump, and then a groan.'\n'So you went to look.' Robbie's gentle comment was not a question. \n'Yes. I grabbed the poker from the hall fireplace first. I thought he'd be so annoyed if I confronted someone with nothing to protect myself. But there wasn't anyone else there, just Matt on the ground near the block, and...well, I ran back indoors and phoned for an ambulance. He was still alive but there was nothing... he died on the way to hospital. Heads aren't designed for hitting stone.' She looked so forlorn and almost puzzled by what had happened. \n'Chief Superintendent Innocent asked our pathologist to take a look, Mrs Coates. She confirmed that there was nothing anyone could do, and that the injuries were consistent with a fall, not aggravated as they might have been with a push. But whoever caused all the noise was responsible for Dr Coates running out like that, so they were ultimately responsible for his death. We want to find them, not just to put your mind at rest but to protect other people. If he or they have terrorised you, they might have other victims in mind.' It often helped, Robbie thought, to mention other possible victims. It made people remember the wider world, feel protective about others, think more sharply.\n'That's why I phoned Jean. It won't bring Matt back, but it might put a stop to their nasty tricks. They were here last night, too, but I didn't go out.'\n'I should think you didn't. We certainly don't want you falling too. Now, we need to know as much as you can tell us about the whole business: when and how it started and everything you can remember.' They moved back inside and sat in the lounge, a pleasant room on the corner of the house, with windows in two walls and a large fireplace in the third. \n                                                                             lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nIt had begun a couple of months after they'd moved in. At first, there were stupid things - they'd thought it was kids messing about. It was just before Halloween and the house had been empty while the renovations had been taking place, so it seemed a likely explanation. So they had taken no notice of the rattles and bumps and faint moans, thinking it would all stop when the festival was over and when it was obvious the house was lived in again. But it hadn't. By Christmas they were experiencing at least weekly 'attacks'. The rattles and other noises continued and then windows and interior doors seemed to open of their own accord. There were shadows but nothing recognisable and they could just have been the play of light when the doors or windows moved. Lights switched on and off, too. There was a fall of soot in the lounge fireplace but that could have been something the sweep they'd employed had failed to dislodge earlier. The bins were ransacked regularly. They'd reported it, but both the police and the council had shrugged collective shoulders and mentioned urban foxes. They'd suggested they report again if any actual damage occurred. \n'And of course it never did, till it was too late and too horrible,' said Mrs. Coates. She'd made a good witness, with meticulous details, clear recall, and even a diary that she gave them. She pointed out that they'd hoped to catch the culprits and were collecting evidence for when they did.\n'And then Hermione thought you changed your minds about who or what the culprits might be.' James wanted, Robbie assumed, to get the 'haunting' scenario out of the way. He didn't think for a moment that a ghost had caused Matt's death, but they did need to reassure the widow. \n'It sounds stupid, even to me, but we really did begin to consider something unnatural. Matt was an incredibly realistic and practical man, a typical engineer, if you like, but he couldn't see how the sound effects and the movements of the doors and windows were being effected. And of course, once you eliminate the impossible...' Her voice tailed off and she didn't complete the quotation.\n'I think Conan Doyle meant you to consider the improbable natural explanation, not something outside our understanding,' said James, gently. \n'But there were no wires, no cameras, no props of any kind. And there were the rumours...'\n'Rumours?' This was a new element in the story and Robbie was interested.\n'The postman said the last people who lived here had had what he called ' funny 'speriences.' They were the last owners but they emigrated to Spain or somewhere and we aren't in touch, I mean we weren't and I'm not... We bought from an agent and they dealt with everything. The people at the paper shop said the same as the postman. But everybody seemed to think it was just kids. The thing is, there are virtually no kids around here other than tiny ones in prams, and for them to come persistently for years or at least for a few years and then a gap during the sale period and the renovations... And then I listened to a programme on the BBC about poltergeists and, well, I began to think, and so did Matt, and we called our friends and they said Hermione might be interested so we called her and she and that nice husband of hers came to see us but of course they work and it was a weekend and nothing ever happens at weekends...'\nRobbie was glad she had run out of steam. It was evidently distressing for her to recall all the things that had been said or hinted, and their reactions as a couple, when the whole saga had ended in Matt's death, however natural that death was.\n'I'm not surprised you started believing in things you couldn't see,' he said. 'Anyone might, faced with a conundrum like that.' She looked grateful as he went on. 'We'll do our best to get to the bottom of it all.  I'd like to start by having a really good look round. And yes, I know you and your husband would already have done that but sometimes an outsider, especially a trained observer, can pick up little things that add together to form a solution. James, why don't you take outside and I'll have a look round indoors.' \nJames headed for the front door, and Mrs Coates looked between them, not sure what her role was to be. \n'I think the sergeant can cope with the grounds,' said Robbie. 'Maybe if you gave him the keys to any outbuildings? Then you can give me a guided tour of the house.'\n'There's a bunch hanging in the hall. And no, before you ask, nobody could reach them from the letterbox in the front door, even with a long wire. We'd heard of that kind of thing. They're just outside the lounge door, between that and the hall fireplace. You wouldn't even see them from the front door.\u2019 And sure enough, they were on a small rack in the deep niche that led from the hall into the lounge. All the rooms boasted similar niches; all the doors were deep-set. James took the keys, and departed. Robbie looked expectantly at Mrs Coates. \n'Lead on,' he said. He got a faint smile in answer; she recognised the misquotation and knew it was inappropriate, too. Just intended to lighten the atmosphere a little, and in that it succeeded.\n                                                                      lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nThe hall was huge, almost another room, with a fireplace, stairs, three rooms leading immediately off it, a kind of passage that went nowhere with a cupboard under the stairs, and a coat rack, and then a pillar with an old-fashioned fixed telephone, and a corridor beyond it. \nThey crossed to the room opposite the lounge. It was a dining room, with the big windows they'd seen from the outside path, on the same wall as the front door, and with a hatchway into the kitchen. The other room, reached from back of the hall was a study, with two desks, computers, bookshelves, and all the paraphernalia of two busy academics. The corridor led behind the dining room to a large kitchen with a scarlet Aga, and of course the hatch to the dining room. There was a rack of the old fashioned bells that had once been used to summon servants, and a speaking tube beside the hatch. Apparently the bells were now ornamental but had rung when the noises were at their height. On the back wall of the corridor doors opened onto a stone-floored pantry with a marble slab as well as a modern fridge freezer, and what Mrs Coates called a scullery, with a washing machine, a large sink, a tumble drier, and an ironing board. The 'back' door was set on the side wall between the kitchen and the pantry, and led to steps to the yard, passing a coal house on the right. The coal house was full of bagged smokeless fuel, no doubt for the main fireplaces, and Robbie established that the Aga had been solid fuel but had been converted to use gas. There was also a small cloakroom with a W.C. \n'Not really convenient, but the plumbing dictated where it would be best,' said Mrs Coates. 'This is immediately below the bathroom which is at the end of the upstairs corridor. There were already facilities here and we only had to upgrade them.'\nHe was only getting his bearings at the moment so they headed back to the stairs. These had a landing just over half way and then turned back on themselves to get to a long corridor with six bedrooms, a box room, a bathroom and a separate W.C. None of the bedrooms was en suite, which struck him as unusual after the amount that had been spent on the place, but his guide told him they were happy to keep the house roughly as it had always been.\n'We agreed if we ever came to sell, the purchasers could put small bathrooms in the larger rooms,' she said, and then her face clouded over. 'I haven't decided what to do yet. I might sell. It's a big house to live in alone, especially if you can't get the noises stopped.'\nThey were heading downstairs as James came in, shaking his head.\n'Garage, stables, some kind of workshop, all in a straight line with the garage attached to the back wall of the house. Then the vegetable garden and a small cottage on the other side. Probably a lodge of some kind, maybe servants' quarters once upon a time. \nRobbie turned to Mrs Coates as they all re-entered the lounge. 'Is it part of your property?'\n'No. I believe it was, right up to the late '60s. But it's completely separate now. It's called The Lodge, in fact. The people who live there are very nice - university people, you know?' Robbie hoped she didn't notice their involuntary exchange of glances; in Oxford's police experience, university people could be anything but nice at times. \n'We ought to interview them,' he said. ''Did you ask them if they'd seen or heard anything?' \n'Oh no. They're away at the moment - they're often away overnight when he does guest lecturing somewhere and she goes with him - due back tomorrow, I think. But yes, we did ask them a few weeks ago and they hadn't any idea. I suppose you do have to speak to them but I can't think they can help. Their name's something like Mugabe only not. Foreign,' she added, as if it wasn't obvious from her difficulty with the name. 'But extremely nice.' \nRobbie winced inwardly and knew James would, too. Typical English covert xenophobia, though expressed so pleasantly you had to be careful not to blink or you'd miss it.  He wondered how Hermione coped with it, though maybe she just blinked a lot. James had told him a little about the wizarding war, and the way 'muggle-borns' or 'mudbloods' like Hermione had been treated by some of their peers, including, James had admitted, his cousin. It seemed prejudice didn't notice magical boundaries. Or educational ones, he thought, recalling the 'university people' comment. He made a note to find out the correct name and call on the owners of it.\n'Have you had anyone working for you here apart from the people who did the renovation?' That was James, covering yet another angle. \n'No. I do all my own cleaning, and Matt did the garden. Well, there was the sweep who did the chimneys, but he was brought in by the renovation people. And of course there are the people who come to collect the bins, deliver the post, the papers, things like that. And a milkman. We have, that is I have, a daily delivery. I don't like plastic, do you?'\nIt seemed a non sequitur but James fielded it bravely. 'Glass bottles are becoming a thing of the past Mrs Coates, but I expect they alter the flavour.'\nShe bestowed a brilliant smile on him, and Robbie was somehow included in its glow. \n'What about enemies, Mrs Coates? I mean, if this turns out to be kids, it could still be personal, rather than just general mayhem, but somehow I don't think kids could manage the effects you've described. So that leaves us with people who might wish either of you harm or distress. I'm not saying they set out to kill your husband, but they certainly set out to harass.'\n'Nobody I can think of. Matt was popular in his department with both staff and students. And he was about to retire so there couldn't have been anything like jealousy. I'm happy at the school where I teach, and we don't, that is we didn't...' She stopped for a moment. 'We didn't socialise much. We went to faculty parties, went to the theatre and concerts, kept in touch with one or two old friends like the Grangers, and with their children - birthday cards, wedding presents, that kind of thing. And Christmas, of course. We weren't exactly dull, you see, but we didn't have many friends in Oxford, and no likelihood of making enemies.' \nRobbie sighed. 'We'll need to get some of our lads round to look at your wiring, under your floorboards, things like that. And we'll be contacting Brookes and Wood. See if anything could have been put in while they were working. We won't leave any stones unturned, Mrs Coates, but it might take us a while to find anything out. We'll keep in touch. Are you staying here or...?' He left the question open, not sure if she had anywhere else to go, though he supposed she might go to stay with a colleague or perhaps with the Grangers for a few days once the funeral was over. \n'I'm staying.' She looked almost mutinous, as if people had tried already to talk her out of the idea. 'For now, anyway. Matt would have wanted me to, I think.' \n''Surely your husband would have been most concerned about your safety,' said James.\n'Yes, but as I'm not going to try to chase these people, however much noise they create, I'm not likely to be in danger. And I need to be here for the funeral; if our friends come from a distance they need somewhere to stay and it doesn't make sense to ask them to use hotels when I have six bedrooms. You'll let me know as soon as you know anything?' After their nod of agreement she continued. 'You can have people pull the place to pieces if you like, just not on Thursday because that's the funeral. And so long as you put it back together afterwards.'\nWith that, they had to be satisfied, and they left to organise some kind of detailed search of the house. Mrs Coates had assured them that she'd heard nothing in the night since her husband's death, and didn't expect to, till the next week at the soonest. The haunting or whatever it was had never been a nightly occurrence.\nAs they drove back to the station to report to Innocent, it struck Robbie that they had learned precisely nothing. \n                                                                   lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nThat evening, they contacted Ron, to tell him about their lack of progress. Or at least, James contacted Draco, because they knew how to get hold of the aurors but Ron had left for home and they had no known home phone number. The auror who had answered the phone had seemed less than interested in handing out personal information. This was as it should be, in any organisation, but left them at a loss. Robbie's suggestion of borrowing an owl from a bird sanctuary was treated with contempt. \nDraco contacted someone or other, possibly Pansy, who contacted George, who contacted Ron who must have told Hermione to deal with it because the next thing they knew, there she was, in the living room, having apparated in immediately.\n'We only wanted,' said James, his voice muffled by virtue of the fact that his head was in his hands, 'to tell you we have nothing to tell you. You didn't have to rush over here.'\n'I didn't rush. I've just put dinner in the oven and there's an hour to wait so I thought I'd use it productively. And 'nothing to tell' tells us something, really.'\n'You mean you actually cook?' Robbie didn't mean to sound sarcastic; it was just that the idea of an academic witch spending time in the kitchen on ordinary tasks struck him as unlikely.\n'I like cooking. It's a bit like potions, really, with equally disastrous results if you don't concentrate.' She looked at James for confirmation but he shook his head.\n'I didn't go to Hogwarts, you know. I never studied potions.' It was just a statement of fact but Hermione looked pityingly at him.\n'All right, so you had a very deprived education,' she said, and Robbie almost choked on his coffee. \n'So,' Hermione continued, 'how much don't we know?'\n'Everything,' said James. 'The only things we do know are how and where he died, and the bare facts of the noises and lights. We haven't found anything to tell us how they were organised, or who might be responsible. We have a team looking at the house structures, and tomorrow we're going to talk to the building firm who renovated the house, and to the neighbours.'\n'You mean Professor Mbanefo and his wife? Nice people. But Auntie Katie never mixed with them much and they're away a lot. He does some kind of prestigious lecture tours. I doubt if you'll get anything useful from them.' Hermione looked dubious.\n'Well,' said Robbie, 'then at least we'll know there's nothing useful, which is useful in itself, according to you.'\n'Yes.' She sighed. 'I'd have thought if it was kids there'd have been all kinds of information by now.'\n'We've just about ruled out kids. The effects are too sophisticated for the sort of resources they'd have.' \n'But we ruled out ghosts,' said Hermione. \u2018Or at least Ron did. I just sat with Auntie Katie while he had a look around.\u2019\n'Which leaves us with adults who know exactly what they're doing and have a specific agenda. I think we need to know why and how before we can find out who, and that's the line we're intending to investigate.' Robbie hoped Hermione would be satisfied with their plans.\n'Thanks, anyway. Mummy is still worried but at least you're looking into it. Mummy and Daddy are coming down for the funeral, of course, and I'll come over. I asked for the day off work. Ron probably won't come; he only met them once or twice.' She cocked her head on one side as a mild buzz sounded from a pocket in her jeans. 'And now, I need to go so that I don't burn the chicken.' She looked at their clock and stood. Closing her eyes in concentration she disappeared, leaving Robbie ill at ease, as he always was in the presence of apparation, and James slightly amused both by Hermione, and by Robbie's reactions.\n                                                                  lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nThere was nothing they could do until tomorrow. Their own dinner was simpler than a timed chicken dish though Hermione would probably have told them that timing cooking was easy. Robbie transferred some steak from the fridge to a frying pan while James created a salad out of odds and ends: lettuce, cucumber, green pepper, avocado, and spring onions.\n'Shall I add tomato?' He stood back admiring the mixture so far. \n'No need,' said Robbie. 'It looks fine as it is. A green salad should be green, after all.'\nJames had finally moved in with Robbie a few weeks earlier. They had decided that anyone who queried the arrangement could be fobbed off with a landlord/tenant explanation. It wasn't likely to fool any regular visitors but then they didn't have many of those. Robbie felt happy to explain to his family if necessary, and the only other occasional guest was Laura, who might have to be told before she guessed. That way they could appeal for her silence in advance of giving her any information. \nSharing all meals was still a novelty, and they were getting used to each other's style of shopping and cooking. They still sometimes tripped over each other in the kitchen, Robbie attributing this to James's long legs, but it didn't occur to them to take turns at preparing food; working together was by now natural and automatic. \n'Deprived education,' said James, almost snorting over the dressing he was mixing. He gave an extra hard shake to the container as Robbie grinned. \n'To them, not being able to create a mixture that could turn the salad purple probably counts as deprived. Now all you need to do is set an invisible timer and apparate somewhere and come back in seven minutes by which time the steak will be cooked to perfection.' James raised both eyebrows but they both preferred their steak well done and he didn't complain. Nor did he apparate. \nThe nights were getting lighter and they sat for a long time after their meal with the curtains open, watching the dusk shadows deepening. The cat joined them, pressing its nose to the window, and probably thinking about all the mice that would be out and about in the twilight. There was a bowl of food and another of water in the kitchen, and Robbie resisted any idea of letting his pet out to hunt. He could only be glad that sound feline sleep had prevented any altercation with the owl. \nThey watched the news, and some kind of political discussion that got nowhere. When James got up to draw the curtains Robbie got up too.\n'Leave them, lad. We'll have plenty to do tomorrow so we might as well have an early night.' At James's raised eyebrow he grinned. 'OK. Maybe not that early, but we don't need to stay in here.'\n'Especially not with the curtains open.'\n'We're not really overlooked, but no, I wouldn't feel comfortable and I don't suppose you would, either.'\n'You mean sleeping in a potentially public place?'\n'I wasn't thinking of sleeping yet.'\n'You weren't?'\n'James, shut up and come to bed.'\n'That's a really romantic invitation.'\n'It isn't an invitation, it's a demand. Come on.' Robbie headed for the bedroom, not even glancing back to check James was following. He was fairly sure they would soon be in bed, together, and he felt an anticipatory frisson of pleasure. The sex might be natural, but it was by no means as automatic as the cooking or the work partnership. It was still new, amazing, glorious, and Robbie felt humbled knowing he could count on holding James in his arms. He knew he sometimes sounded abrupt, and yes, less than romantic. He didn't quite trust himself to say everything he thought, or to express himself in a way James might find 'soppy'. His brusque manner was a defence against the flood of sweetness that threatened to overwhelm him every time he looked at his young partner. \nHe drew the curtains in the bedroom straight away. The sky was a beautiful colour, deep blue with a few stars already visible, but the bedroom was more likely to attract stray glances from passing traffic, especially if the light was on as they undressed. They could do without the sky, he thought. The view indoors was more enticing. \nJames had followed on his heels; of course he had. He walked straight into Robbie's arms and the undressing didn't take long. \nThe sex, on the other hand, took a satisfactorily long time. Robbie found it necessary to explore every sensitive part of James all over again, just to check the sensitivity was still as acute. Ears, collar bone, hips, inner thighs. James reacted as expected to the kisses and fingertip strokes afforded each one, and then pointed out that it was only fair he should be allowed the same privileges with Robbie. He spent some time playing with Robbie's nipples, till they were hard and proud, and coaxed a faint moan from him when he cupped his arse in his hands, running his long middle fingers along the crease where cheeks joined legs. \n'What do you want?' He whispered it into Robbie's shoulder. \n'Anything. Anything that involves you. Everything. I don't know. You decide.' \n'But I want to make sure I please you.'\n'You do that just by existing.' With James's face pressed against him he could feel those expressive eyebrows lifting. 'You do realise that, don't you?' he said. \n'I try to believe you. I've never been so...appreciated?'\n'Believe me.' He chuckled softly. 'This, here, us, me, think of it as the James Hathaway appreciation society.' He smiled when James's arms tightened round him. 'Fuck me?' he suggested quietly, and so James did. \nIt was some kind of special heaven, Robbie decided, to lie with his legs raised, his muscles working to clasp James to him, savouring the weight of the man on top of him, and the strength of him inside him. They had decided to abandon the idea of condoms. Robbie had been with no-one else since Val's death, and James, whilst  he had indulged in some heavy flirting, had had no sexual partners since before he entered the seminary. They had both been tested - to destruction, Robbie sometimes thought - every time there was blood at a scene, blood they might have touched, blood that might have splattered them, and every time they had even the slightest injury inflicted by a suspect. So now he was able to feel James, just James, with no barrier and no worry, however faint.\nThey moved in unison. There was still an unfinished quality to their lovemaking, both of them a little shy, not quite believing their good fortune. But they were beginning to learn each other. It was like learning a musical instrument; it was important to stick to pieces at their current level of expertise, practice couldn't help but improve everything, and if there were mistakes, they had realised they shouldn't falter, but carry on, aiming for perfect harmony.\nRobbie reached for his cock but James slapped his hand away and stroked him firmly. \n'Mine,' he said, then, 'Come for me, Robbie, my Robbie.' And Robbie soared, melted, fell apart, lay boneless, breathing hard and looking into James's eyes as his lover followed him into bliss. \n                                                                  lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nThe Mbanefos were back from their, or rather his, brief lecture tour. His wife had tagged along and had enjoyed it very much, thank you. A Nigerian academic lecturing on Caribbean literature in Glasgow had generated a lot of interest, and Mrs Mbanefo had managed a side trip to the museum housing the art of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. They were pleasant, friendly, and the providers of excellent coffee.\n'Ethiopian', said Mrs Mbanefo when she saw the appreciative faces of her guests. Then they got down to the business of discussing the reason for their visit.\n'We don't really know our neighbours,' said James Mbanefo. Having the same first name as Sergeant Hathaway caused endless confusion and some hilarity when both men responded to any remark addressed to 'James'. 'They haven't been here long and they seem to keep themselves to themselves in what I believe is a typically British fashion. But they would nod and exchange pleasantries when they saw us. We never talked long enough to hear about any troubles. We're sorry to hear about Dr Coates' sad death.' \nThey had not known. Robbie and James had broken the news when they had rung the bell and said they needed to talk. The professor had looked suitably sad, but Robbie had noticed that Mrs Mbanefo had gone almost grey with a pinched look to her lips. She was clearly the most shocked of the pair, perhaps more shocked than might have been expected in the case of barely known neighbours. He wondered momentarily why it affected her so badly but turned his attention back to the husband who was speaking.\n'An accident, I think you said,' said the professor.\n'Yes,' said Robbie, 'but an accident caused by someone or ones acting recklessly. That makes it possible manslaughter and we need to find out as much as we can. You've had no problems here? No night time noises or unusual happenings?'\n'None. If we had, I think we might have suspected local teenagers with racist or xenophobic tendencies. That doesn't explain the Coates' experience, I know. In Nigeria it might have been put down to witchcraft.' He gave an apologetic smile as if to say he knew Africa had some customs that would not be considered the norm by British policemen but that he didn't share the beliefs of his native continent. \n'But James...' Mrs Mbanefo stopped, uncertainty playing across her rather pretty features. Given an encouraging look by Robbie and a nod from James, she went on. 'They said 'unusual' not necessarily supernatural or anything of that nature, and there were the letters...'\nHer husband frowned and took up the story. 'I hadn't forgotten about those but you're right, I wasn't thinking of them as unusual in this context. We had a number of anonymous letters when we first came here. Threats, general nastiness. When it must have become clear that we were not intimidated, they stopped, but then the offers started, in similar envelopes, with an Oxford postmark, and no, I'm sorry, I didn't keep any of them. In their own way they were as much of a nuisance as the poison pen ones.'\n'Offers?' Robbie had no idea what kind of offers might be involved. It turned out they were offers to buy the house, naming preposterously large sums. The hopeful purchasers all signed different names but the professor had suspected the same person was sending all the letters. \n'There was something about the style, the phrasing, as well as the stationery. I wish I'd kept one now.' Mbanefo frowned again.\n'I wanted to get a sign - like those 'for sale' signs but one that said 'not for sale',' said his wife, 'but James thought it would just draw attention to the problem and we might get copycat letters from the earlier nuisances.'\n'It never ceases to amaze me,' Hathaway reflected aloud, 'what goes on in our area that never comes to the attention of the police.'\n'No reason why it should, really,' said Robbie, 'if the victims don't feel in need of help. But it helps us to know about this kind of thing in an investigation like this. So thank you for telling us. Did you ever find out who was at the bottom of it?'\n'No,' said the professor, slowly, 'but we had our suspicions. There was a big local campaign - articles in the newspapers and petitions to sign in the shops round here. One of the big supermarket chains wanted to build by the river and this bit of Oxford was their favoured location. They've applied for planning permission, I believe, and the car park would come right up to our garden fence. I thought perhaps they might have wanted more space and been hoping to get our little plot. We haven't had any offers for a while, but of course when they actually start building, if they do, we might have to think again about selling up and moving. I hope not.'\n                                                               lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nArmed with a copy of the planning application, the suspicions of the Mbanefos and the results of an interview with Brooks and Wood, Robbie and James repaired to the pub. During the chat with the builders they had quickly realised that during the renovations almost anyone might have had access to the unoccupied house. There had been subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, day labourers, people walking past and showing a general interest, and at times, almost no security. The house and garden had been empty at night, with no alarms, cameras or guards. There had not seemed to be any need.\nAccess to the property was by the gate at the side of the house leading onto the drive which led round to the front door and then to the coach house. The beeches provided an effective barrier, and the stream led down the fairly extensive gardens to the river. Obviously, anyone could moor a boat by the boathouse and make their way up across the lawns.\n'So,' said Robbie, 'we have a possible motive and a possible scenario for arranging things like odd wiring, but the team have come back with a totally negative report about any such wiring or other ways of producing the effects, manual or electronic. They found some oddities, but only things that could have been poor workmanship. I expect even Brooks and Wood have their share of workmen who cut corners.'\n'And we're back with the Nigerian diagnosis of witchcraft,' said James, grinning. 'Not as exotic or unlikely as they seemed to think we'd think, at that.'\n'A supermarket chain using witchcraft - wizardry, rather - to intimidate people living on land they want to purchase? It doesn't sound plausible, James. I can't see Tesco or Asda or any of them having a resident wizard on the payroll.'\n'No, but they'll have a department tasked with putting pressure on people. And someone in that department might know someone who always gets good results. The initiators of the actions don't necessarily always know what goes on in their name.'\n'I suppose so. It's going to be quite a slog finding out who's behind it and who they've used.'\n'I'd better interview the boy in the boathouse,' said James, ignoring the startled look on Robbie's face. 'It doesn't sound as if Ron took much notice of him but he might know something. And if there's a threat to his chosen haunt, he might be quite eager to tell us.' He finished his drink and rose, ready to go. Robbie followed him.\nWhile James headed for the boathouse Robbie called on Katie Coates, keeping her informed about their progress.\n'Except that there isn't any, really,' he said. 'Apart from a suspicion that it might all be connected to a supermarket chain wanting your land. Do you know anything about that?'\n'We had a letter, which Matt threw away, and a couple of phone calls. He put the phone down after a moment during the first, and immediately at the second.'\n'But they were keen?'\n'I suppose so. But they must have got some other land because the calls stopped.'\n'That doesn't mean they gave up, just that they changed their tactics.'\n'Oh! You mean they might have been trying to frighten us into moving? But how...?'\n'That's the part we don't understand yet, but we think we've probably found the motive, and the person or rather the company that set everything in motion. My sergeant is looking into a few possibilities about the methods used, but our team found nothing in the structure to worry you.'\nMrs Coates looked doubtful. \u2018I think it's the lack of any actual interference with the bricks, mortar, glass and so on that's the biggest worry. It takes me back to a supernatural explanation and that doesn't sit well with a supermarket somehow.'\nSince Robbie had expressed the same doubts himself he was at a loss as to how to reassure her. He hoped James would get something out of the boy in the boathouse. Or did he? Did he actually believe there was a ghost in the boathouse who might help the investigation? He shook his head, accepted a cup of tea from Mrs Coates and sat down to wait. \nWhen James joined them he seemed preoccupied. He told Mrs Coates he had nothing further to report but that there were more avenues to explore. Then he fidgeted until Robbie felt obliged to gulp his tea quickly and take his sergeant back to the police station where no doubt he would be able to unburden himself without the presence of a member of the public. Although she wasn't exactly a member of the public, more a victim. But it wouldn't do to discuss theories in front of her, especially theories involving magic and a real ghost. \n                                                                 lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\n\u2018I\u2019m going to have to contact Draco or Hermione,' said James. 'Hermione, probably, because whilst Draco's my cousin and my magical mentor, he isn't involved in this case whereas Hermione is, and I understand from him that she was considered incredibly clever at school - a real rival, in fact.'\n'Nothing deprived about her, then despite the muggle background.'\n'Nothing at all. Another plus to asking Hermione is that she's married to Ron who used his auror skills to find there was nothing to find. She'll have some idea what techniques he used and what he might have missed.'\n'I think it's me that's missing something,' said Robbie. 'Do I gather you got some information from the boathouse boy?'\n'William? Yes, but I don't understand it and I need to do some research before I try telling you what at present is quite a garbled story.'\n'William?' \n'Yes. He's quite a nice lad, really. Drowned in the river in a boating accident way back a hundred years ago and has hung around the boathouse ever since. It was the nearest bit of dry land he could find to haunt, but he tends to drip a lot and make it damp. It must be very boring for him; it's never used nowadays.'\nRobbie sighed. He hoped James was not going to get any kind of bee in his bonnet about ghost welfare. \n'This whole case is reminding me more and more of that old Scots prayer rhyme thing,' he said. 'From ghoulies and ghosties, and long-legged beasties, And things that go bump in the night, Protect us, O Lord, And from the fury of the Northmen, deliver us.' We seem to have everything except the Northmen.'\n'I've never heard that last line,' said James. 'And it was always, 'Good Lord deliver us'. Not quite such a formally expressed prayer.'\n'Vikings, I assume,' said Robbie. 'My dad used to say it all to me at bedtime.'\n'Not very comforting.'\n'Well, he always laughed, and I always thought the prayer would protect me. I can't remember what I thought the Northmen were then. But I repeated it faithfully after him.'\n'At any rate,' said James, 'it's more likely women the Scots would have feared. And a woman in this case, too. 'The monstrous regimen of women' to quote John Knox since we're on the subject of Scots and religion.'\n'I've never understood that. They didn't have regiments of women, did they? Or was he thinking of Amazons?'\n'Regimen, not regiment. It means rule or reign and he was referring to Elizabeth 1 and Mary Queen of Scots. But I wasn't referring to any queens,' he added hastily, before Robbie could get embroiled in further confusion. \n'But you were referring to women?'\n'At least one woman. William was adamant. She was all over the grounds at night while the builders were busy, but he never saw her face. Ghosts are no better at seeing in the dark than the rest of us. The odd thing is that he says she went under. That's all he would say. Kept stressing that she went under, every night, and I have no idea what he meant. He wouldn't elaborate, just dripped a bit more and faded into the river for a while. But he did say he sensed magic when she was around.'\n'And Ron said he didn't find any traces.'\n'Not exactly. He said he only found background stuff. That's why I need to consult someone.'\n'Hermione it is, then,' said Robbie, picking up the phone on his desk and checking his mobile for the number for the Ministry of Magic. \n                                                                lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\n'There's plenty of low level magic in Oxford,' said Hermione after she'd apparated into their office, alarming Robbie, not because anyone was watching but because she hadn't been issued with a visitor's badge and there was a high chance of someone, almost anyone, interrupting them. He relaxed when James showed her a picture of one on the computer and she transfigured a fair imitation from a post-it note and a rubber band. Or was it an imitation? Was it maybe the real thing? Would it turn back to its original state in the drawer overnight? He resolved not to ask, just to remember to check.\n'Yes, you told us about that when you and Ron came to see us together at the start of all this,' said James. 'But what I need to know is whether the general stuff could mask anything more specific.'\n'Possibly. Especially if the witch or wizard was just passing through, and not actually doing any magic. And almost certainly if they went far enough underground.'\n'You mean like in the underground library storage rooms under Radcliffe Square?' \n'Yes, anywhere solid and protected like a church crypt, an underground car park, a storage facility, or even a tunnel. They would just have to get far enough away from the entrance. Then it would be hard for anyone to pinpoint anything more than general magic in the area.'\n'Eureka!' James' exclamation startled both his listeners.\n'There's no arithmancy involved, is there?' said Hermione.\n'No mathematics of any kind, to my knowledge,' said Robbie. \n'I was just expressing my delight at realising what William meant.' James' lopsided smile suggested he was pleased with himself and somewhat insulted by their reactions at the same time, which Robbie thought gave him a rather endearing look. 'He didn't mean she went under. I was thinking about the river or about going to sleep. But he meant under the ground. We should look for a tunnel.'\n'And Mrs Weasley,' said Robbie, 'if you could possibly spare the time to look with us? We might need more magical expertise than James has yet acquired.'\n'Due,' muttered James, ' to my deprived education.' But Hermione either didn't hear him or elected to ignore him.\nSure enough, she put the visitor's badge on the desk before she and James apparated flinging a casual, 'to the boathouse' in Robbie's direction. He placed the badge in the drawer, glad not to have to deal with the front desk and the likelihood of wrong numbers and stray post-it notes. Then he went to the car park and took the mundane or muggle route to Beeches. \nHermione was already chatting to Auntie Katie when Robbie arrived, and James was not in sight.\n'Your partner's gone to the boathouse,' Hermione said, and Robbie wasn't sure which way she meant partner but wasn't about to ask.  He thought the aurors probably knew that he and James were a couple, and he thought, though it had never been explicitly stated, that the wizarding world didn't care much about same sex relationships. Of course, the muggle world shouldn\u2019t; same sex marriage was in the process of being legalised and celebrated. But there was still prejudice and caution was still advisable, especially in a profession such as theirs. \n'Auntie Katie says she hasn't heard of any tunnels but that doesn't mean there aren't any,' Hermione said at last, perhaps realising that Robbie, having neither magic nor psychic powers, had no idea what might be going on. \nAs she spoke, there was a commotion. The soil in the vegetable plot shook as if there were a small and localised earthquake. Then it erupted and a rather grubby James rose from the depths. \n'I suppose that means there are some,' said Robbie.\n'Tunnels? Oh, yes, quite a labyrinth down here,' said James, gripping the edge of something invisible near a row of spring greens and hoisting himself up into the daylight. 'I've had a good look. I think they might have connected the main house to the lodge and the boathouse in the days when priest holes were fashionable. Or maybe just escape routes for Jacobites. The house isn't quite old enough for either but it was probably built on the site of an earlier one. They're narrow and cramped, and dark, of course, but Mrs Coates kindly lent me a torch.' He held it out, oblivious of the fact that it was switched off, and he and Hermione exchanged a look. Clearly, he had made his own light. Robbie hoped Mrs Coates was not particularly observant or assumed James was being careful with the battery. \n'I believe there was a house here before the present one. A Tudor one that burnt down some time in the eighteenth century. Matt was interested but we couldn't find out much. We meant to do some research.' Her face clouded and Hermione patted her arm. 'So there could have been priest holes or something of that sort.'\n'And,' said James, 'I found evidence that someone had been cleaning away the kind of rubbish that accumulates in such places. There were footprints, too. They go under the house, and it's quite possible the tunnel comes out somewhere you wouldn't expect. Is there a cellar? I found a door, but it was locked.'\n'There's a cellar.' Hermione, of course, knew the house from visits. 'It's quite low-ceilinged and you wouldn't use it for anything but storage. The heating boiler's down there, and Uncle Matt's wine collection. There are doors, but I assumed they just led to more store rooms. Brooks and Wood might know but then again, if they didn't have a key and there was nothing to suggest more than a cupboard, they might not.'\n'We could break the door down, with your permission,' said Robbie, and was instantly given permission to do anything he liked if he thought it might solve the mystery and prevent further incidents. \n'Or,' said James, 'we could refrain from doing any damage and just pick the lock.' \nRobbie blushed. He was about to suggest sending for someone from the station then realised that James and Hermione between them were quite capable of picking the lock without lock picks, and that Mrs Coates wouldn't, probably, realise that the average detective didn't come armed with lock picks as a matter of course. And that she would hopefully never mention the matter to Jean Innocent.\n'James, why don't you go and investigate from inside the house. Mrs Weasley can show you where the cellar is and maybe help identify the right door to start on. Mrs Coates could perhaps help me find something to fence off the hole in her cabbage patch before anyone falls in.' He didn't wait to see if his suggestions were being followed but set off in the direction of the stable block where he hoped to find something useful. \nLater, when they'd got help from the station, cordoned off the cellar and the garden tunnel entrances with police tape, and left a young constable on guard duty outside the house, knowing he would more than likely end up inside it with tea and cake, Robbie and James told Mrs Coates they'd better report to Innocent, and would be back later.\n'At least we know now how they gained access to the house,' said Hermione, following them to Robbie's car and telling her aunt she would phone or visit the next day. 'But we're none the wiser about how they arranged the special effects.'\n'If she, and we'll assume it's the woman William saw, got under the house, could she create the effects by magic without adding significantly to the magic to an extent Ron would notice?' James addressed his question to Hermione.\n'Probably. If she had been in the house while it was empty and perhaps left things in there - small things like a thread under a floorboard, a little oil in a hinge, and some extra wire in the fuse box - then she could have transfigured those things into tools to open doors, bang shutters, switch lights off and on. But as you said, she would have to be a magic user. She couldn't have done all that from the cellar without leaving traces, otherwise.'\nJames sighed. 'The footprints go all the way under The Lodge. I can't help suspecting Mrs Mbanefo. Could she be a magic user?'\n'There's no reason why not, and even if Ron had sensed magic near their house he wouldn't have queried it. We don't know all the witches and wizards in the country. Some were born or educated or both in other countries and if they don't come to the attention of the aurors we may not know about them at all.'\n'They don't all shop in Diagon Alley at some time or other?' \n'Not necessarily. If they already have a wand and don't need robes, they can do without magic shops to a great extent. But even if they went, they could just lose themselves, one more witch or wizard in the crowd. Though I think we're talking witches only, here, aren't we?'\nRobbie groaned. 'How are we going to explain African witchcraft to Innocent? Well, to anyone, really. It's as bad as ghosts.'\n'Don't let William hear you,' said James as they pulled into the police station car park. \n                                                               lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nThis time, to Robbie's relief, Hermione came past the reception desk and got the proper visitor badge on a red lanyard.\n'We don't need to explain,' she said. 'We just have to establish that she did it, then either suggest she could have made noises from the cellar leaving the Coates' own imagination to do the rest, or we can give details and then do something about everyone's memories.'\n'I like the first idea better,' said Robbie, who found the wizarding attitude to memories breathtaking and bordering on criminal. Especially applied to police colleagues. \nThey met with Innocent, who knew Hermione slightly and evidently simply thought of her as the daughter of one of Katie's friends.\n'What is it you're doing now?' she asked. 'I think you read chemistry, didn't you?' \n'Yes. I have a civil service research post,' said Hermione, not going into details. \n'Cambridge, was it? Did you ever meet Sergeant Hathaway? You must have been up round about the same time.'\nHermione merely shook her head, refuting both notions without giving anything away, but blushed to the roots of her curly hair as she looked at James. 'Not such a deprived education after all, then,' she said, and James just sniffed. \nRobbie described the tunnels. \u2018You see,\u2019 he told Innocent, \u2018that gives possible access to the cellar of Beeches.\u2019\n\u2018But could they, whoever they were, really have created all those effects from the cellar?\u2019 The Chief Superintendent sounded doubtful and Robbie supposed she had a point.\n\u2018Psychology,\u2019 said James. \u2018Frighten people enough with mysterious noises and you can scare them into imagining they've heard and seen more than they in fact have.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Jean, slowly. \u2018I suppose I can see that happening. It\u2019s like the way witnesses are quite unreliable.\u2019\n\u2018We think,\u2019 explained Hermione, \u2018it might be connected with the neighbours. The tunnels connect with their house, anyway.\u2019\n\u2018The Mbanefos? What do we know about them?\u2019 said Innocent. \nJames pulled up details about the Mbanefos on his computer. There was plenty about the professor, but his wife was simply given as Dolly Mbanefo, born Dolly Adeyemi.  Beyond that she was a cipher, a shadow behind her husband. \nThere was a knock at the door and a constable came to tell Innocent some dignitary was waiting for her in her office. When she had left the room Hermione shouldered James out of the way and took his place at the keyboard. She brought up a website neither of the men recognised and searched again. Dolly Adeyemi had been born in Nigeria and had attended Haute Montaigne, a wizarding school in Cote d'Ivoire. She had gone on to a wizarding university near Cairo, then returned home with a degree in architecture, and married James Mbanefo, a studious young man chosen for her by her parents. He was a muggle, and might know little about Dolly's abilities. \n\u2018Look here,\u2019 said Hermione. She had switched to a site about Haute Montaigne. \u2018It says it\u2019s possible for African witches and wizards to hide behind jokes about old fashioned tribal practices, witch doctors, and so on. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. If they hide, they could easily move unseen in the corridors of power in their chosen field. The site says many of them become extremely rich.\u2019 \n\u2018Did Dolly become rich?\u2019 Robbie wondered if she\u2019d left a life of luxury for a small house in Oxford.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018It looks as she didn\u2019t manage to find the road to riches before her marriage swept her off to England. He husband laboured for some years at a provincial red-brick university, then he finally gained prestige and recognition at Oxford ten years ago. Dolly never worked but if they\u2019d had money I think they\u2019d have had at least a larger house.\u2019\n\u2018So\u2019, said James. \u2018She might well want money, either for them both or for herself, she has the tunnels to give her access to Beeches, and her husband is out lecturing to students here, there and everywhere most of each week.\u2019\n\u2018Not weekends,\u2019 Hermione reminded them. \u2018And there were no disturbances at weekends, which suggests the professor was in the dark about whatever Dolly was up to.\u2019 \n'Right,' said Robbie. 'Means, motive and opportunity. Bang to rights.'\n'By which,' said James, 'you mean magic, a desire for money, tunnels and time. We'll assume the supermarket people employed her directly or one of their enterprising agents did. And that they promised to leave her house alone while she was busy and make her husband an offer he really couldn't refuse afterwards. I suppose she sent all the letters to her husband to give herself some kind of alibi.'\n'Makes sense. Though what would she want the money for, apart from a desire to be rich?\u2019 Robbie found it hard to imagine Dolly wanting money for its own sake. \u2018The professor won't be exactly poor, their house is lovely even though it\u2019s small, and they go on jaunts like lecture tours at the university's expense. I gather some of them were further afield than Scotland.'\n'It was an arranged marriage,' said Hermione. 'She might have been aiming for independence, maybe even at leaving him.'\n'We'll only know if we ask her,' said James. And they returned to the car park, the two magic users electing, this time, to use ordinary transport. The chief inspector popped out of her office to wave them on their way.\n'Try to arrest somebody,' she said. 'I want this cleared up as soon as possible. And no, not because Katie Coates is a friend but because we really can't have people frightening other people to death in Oxford, now can we?'\n                                                             lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\nRobbie hadn't intended to take Hermione with them. Civilians were not welcome at anything that might turn into an interview or even an arrest. He supposed, rather vaguely, that it might be useful to let her go and see her aunt, especially if it turned out that a neighbour had been the ghostly visitor. But somehow they were on the doorstep of the lodge, or rather The Lodge, the little house where the Mbanefos lived, and Hermione was with them, clearly regarding herself as part of the team. \nRobbie coughed. 'You should really go and see your aunt,' he said, knowing perfectly well his voice was not as authoritative as he might have hoped. Hermione looked at him as if he might be speaking something un-English, Dolly's native Yoruba, perhaps, or the Arabic she would have spoken in Cairo. Or the French from Haute Montaigne, he added uneasily to himself. This was a very educated lady they were about to deal with. \n'I think Hermione might be able to help us,' said James, ignoring Robbie's look of betrayal. 'Another witch, you know.' Robbie didn't really know but thought it might be as well to pretend he did. He nodded and rang the doorbell. \nShe was alone in the house. Professor Mbanefo was lecturing somewhere or other and might stay for drinks afterwards. His wife was not expecting him home till late. In some ways it made their job easier but if she was guilty it would be even harder to face her husband and give him the news of her arrest. If they managed to arrest her, of course. Robbie's thoughts were swirling with half formed ideas of what an African witch could possibly be able to do, even here, in Oxford, but he tried to clear his mind and continue the investigation as calmly as he could. \nThey sat in the rather conventional lounge, its only concession to the Mbanefo country of origin a wall hanging with gorgeous earth tones creating an abstract picture that suggested a tropical location without depicting anything. \nMrs Mbanefo offered tea, coffee, water, whatever liquid refreshment they would like, and seemed put out when all three of them refused. \n'You said you needed more information about the disturbances next door,' she said. 'I have no idea what more I can tell you.'\n'Your husband mentioned witchcraft,' said Robbie, bluntly. Better to take the bull by the horns from the start, or, he mentally amended, in this case the rather graceful gazelle. 'I know you both seemed sceptical but we wondered if you could give us any further hints as to why he even brought the topic up.'\nDolly laughed, a high, forced laugh. 'You can't be serious. I thought the British police would be above such superstitious rubbish. Back in Lagos, now...'\n'So the police there would take the suggestion seriously?' James spoke softly but smoothly and Dolly turned to look at him. \n'They might,' she said. 'There are all kinds of beliefs there. Most of them arrant nonsense of course, and the ones that aren't, well, they don't travel well, and they don't survive things like electric light and computers.'\n'Really?' Hermione's entry into the conversation shocked Dolly, who must have assumed the woman was merely a constable present to chaperone her in some way. 'I thought Haute Montaigne had a reputation for beautiful grounds with a great deal of light, most of it electric.'\n'How do you...?' She stopped. 'Well, as I said, there are all kinds of belief systems and they don't transfer well to British soil. Too much Church of England, too much strong tea, too many shortbread biscuits.' Her eyes were darting from one to the other, trying to see whether they were lulled by her words.\n'Oh,' said Hermione, 'you mean we shouldn't be able to do magic here? What a quaint idea.' After she spoke, she muttered something almost inaudible and looked pleased when a cushion on the couch writhed, flowed, and curled into the shape of a cat. It snuggled into the cushion next to it, which mercifully remained unaltered, and Robbie could have sworn that it purred. \n'Tea never seemed to affect me much,' said James, apologetically, then added in a conversational tone, 'Expelliarmus,' just as Dolly's hand moved towards her sleeve. \nOnce she realised that two of the three police - she must still assume Hermione was a member of the force - were magic users, and once James was idly twirling her wand, all Dolly's bravado left her. \n'So you already know,' she said. There was a kind of despair in her voice. And then she started talking, telling them everything they needed to know, confessing to the disturbances, to working for the supermarket people, to the night that had led to Matt Coates' death. \nThe supermarket, she explained, knew nothing about the magic. She had contacted them after her husband refused the offer for their house. She was desperate for money, and this seemed a way to make sure she could get it. She wanted to leave him. She hated being tied to a muggle who laughed at all mention of wizardry and called it primitive. She hated her parents for forcing her into a loveless marriage, and for their earlier treatment of her. \n'I had that African operation as a child,' she said. 'You know what I'm talking about?' She paused, looking at Hermione who looked back at her with sympathy. 'Something went wrong and I can never have children. Even magic couldn't help. But if I had money I could at least build some kind of life for myself. Here, I'm just Mrs Mbanefo, without any of the love or mutual satisfaction that should mean.'\nShe hoped that by selling the house or at least by making the sale more likely, she would be in a position to demand money from her James. If she simply left him, he would certainly just stay in the house, and might dole out some alimony, but not much, considering that it would be her decision to leave and there were no children involved. She wasn't sure about English divorce laws, but she hoped, oh how much she hoped. Even her magic was stunted and crippled by her marriage.\nAt this point, she cried and Hermione ended up sitting with her arm around her while James gallantly offered a pristine handkerchief, something, unlike lock picks, the well-armed detective always carried. \nAnd so when the supermarket pointed out that unless Beeches was part of the deal the land would be next to useless, she told them she might be able to persuade her neighbours. She had used a few spells which failed to prevent the previous owners from selling to the Coates before the supermarket could even put in an offer. Then, when the house was still being renovated, she had easily gained entry at night, using magic, of course, and had found the tunnels. She had interfered with some of the building work: a nail here, a screw there, a tile, a wire or a window catch. Slight adjustments that nobody would notice, some brought about by magic but leaving very little magical signature, and some simply done by hand.  Then, once the Coates had moved in it was an easy matter to go into the tunnels, and send small tendrils of magic to nudge the damaged places. There had been no attempt to try to persuade them - she feared rejection would put them on their guard. \n'I thought nobody would know,' she said. 'I thought nobody would believe, or rather that they would believe it was incomprehensible and shrug their shoulders. And move out. And that would solve all my problems.'\n'You almost succeeded,' said James. 'Even when magic users investigated they thought what they could sense was just part of Oxford's background magic. The tunnels are quite deep and your magic was not strong. Why did you let yourself be seen? It was chasing you that led to Dr Coates' fall and death. We can understand that you didn't intend to hurt him, but you did wish him ill, and your actions led to his death, so...' He stopped, unwilling to tell her how shaky the law was at this point. The CPS might very well refuse to go ahead with any case. \n'It was a nice night,' she said. 'I didn't want to go into the tunnels again. Dark, dirty places. I thought I could work from outside, and it never occurred to me that he might come out.' Her voice lowered and quivered as she added, 'I didn't even know until we got back from Scotland. I'm truly sorry for what happened.'\nRobbie thought she probably was, but that didn't help them to come to any kind of decision about charging her, about explaining to Innocent, or even telling Katie Coates for that matter.\nHermione was not indecisive at all. She used her phone to contact Ron and in a few moments Ron and Harry were in the small lounge. When she understood that they were aurors, English aurors at that, Dolly Mbanefo fell even further apart. Somehow or another they got her to write a confession that implicated money, supermarkets, tunnels and other mundane matters without ever mentioning magic as the underlying modus operandi.  And then they arrested her.\nThe charge was using her magic to bring harm, and eventually death, to muggles, and Harry warned her curtly that the consequences could be severe. \n'But I'll help you prepare not a defence but a plea of mitigation,' said Hermione as they reclaimed Dolly's wand from James, handcuffed her, and apparated away.\n'Poor woman,' said Robbie, speaking for all three of them. Her face, as the aurors had made ready to apparate, had been accepting and despairing. He hoped her punishment would not be too severe, although he felt she should suffer for the death she had caused and the wizarding world was more likely to be able to deliver that punishment and suffering than his own. \nHe and Hermione left a rather unhappy James to tell Professor Mbanefo, on his return, that his wife, having confessed to being behind the so-called hauntings at Beeches, had escaped custody and disappeared. They had agreed that James would say the police were looking for her. He did not need to add that it was highly unlikely she'd be found. \n                                                                 lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh   \nThey strolled across to Beeches, and as they went, Robbie contacted Jean Innocent by phone to let her know the culprit had indeed been identified, an arrest had taken place but the prisoner had escaped. \nThe Chief Superintendent reached the house just as they were explaining to a rather surprised Mrs Coates that her rather nice, quiet neighbour had been lurking in tunnels beneath their feet and setting off traps and tricks she had put in place while the building was not lived in.\n'So you see, Auntie Katie,' said Hermione, 'it wasn't anything supernatural. Just a desperate woman wanting you to move so that she could sell her house and be assured of some money.'\n'Her tricks were very convincing,' said Katie, a little doubtfully, as Innocent joined them. \n'Yes, well,' said Hermione, 'she studied architecture and civil engineering in Cairo. She wasn't just a pretty face.'\n'Pretty face but murderous, too,' said Innocent. 'I have no idea how she escaped three of you, and I hope every effort is being made to find her.' She glowered at Robbie.\n'We were remiss, ma'am,' he admitted. 'She seemed so genuinely sorry and I actually believe she was, but obviously not enough to face a court to make amends for her actions. We didn't handcuff her.' He didn't say that this was because the aurors had done so. \nHis boss glowered again but sighed. 'No good crying over spilt milk,' she said, in a tone that suggested there might be a great deal of mopping up to do when there were no members of the public present. \nThey chatted to Mrs Coates for a while, though everyone refused an offer of tea. Hermione elicited the information that her aunt might keep the house for a while, because it was what Matt would have wanted, but that she thought in the end it would be too big.\n'I suppose', she said, rather wistfully, 'that Professor Mbanefo might sell The Lodge, now. I could buy that instead.'\n'I think you might still have trouble with the supermarket people,' said Jean. 'If you want to stay in Oxford and remain at the same school there are a few nice small houses near us that might suit you. But we'll leave that for the moment.'\n'Until after the funeral, anyway,' said Hermione. She checked the arrangements, promised to attend, and left. Jean and Katie must have assumed she had her own car. Robbie knew that once she was out of sight she would apparate. He hoped she was out of sight of everyone; the last things they needed were any more rumours of supernatural incidents at Beeches. \nHis phone rang: James, saying he'd explained to the professor, who was confused and distressed and angry in about equal measures. 'But he isn't sure who to be angry with,' he said. 'And before he decides it's me, I'm leaving.'\n'I need a word with my sergeant,' Robbie told the two women. 'I'll walk across and meet him.' Without looking to Jean for approval he simply left, going straight out of the front door and towards the path that led to The Lodge. \nJames was already near the stables. He smiled at Robbie. 'One vanished witch, one disgruntled professor, and presumably one relieved widow, ' he said. \n'I think the Chief Superintendent is unsure whether to be as disgruntled as the professor or just pleased for her friend,' said Robbie, smiling back. 'And we've solved another case, courtesy of aurors and wizards.'\n'And witches,' James reminded him.\n'And witches,' said Robbie, solemnly, 'and owls, and boys in boathouses, and secret tunnels and heaven knows what else.'\nJames grinned broadly, his narrow face lighting up. 'But you're getting to like it,' he said, and it wasn't a question. \nRobbie looked at him and without conscious thought they ended up in a hug. Then Robbie, careless of where they were, tilted his face and invited a kiss. It was forthcoming, and the two men lost themselves in the pleasure of the moment. \nA cough brought them to themselves and they sprang apart. Jean Innocent was standing outside the front door. The path where Robbie and Jamie stood was in direct line of sight.\n'I didn't see that,' she said, sternly. 'If I had seen it, I'd have had to say something about behaviour on duty appropriate to your station.'\n'But you didn't see anything. The light is fading,' said Katie, behind her. \n'And we aren't on duty; we finished the case and we've put in more than enough hours today,' muttered Robbie. But he didn't say it loudly enough for Innocent to hear. \n'As I said,' said Innocent, 'I didn't see anything. I'll see you two in my office tomorrow morning, though, about the laxity concerning handcuffing prisoners. Not about anything I didn't see tonight.'\nThey assured her they would be there, thanked her for something not actually mentioned, and wished everyone goodnight. \n'Do you think we ought to speak to William/' Robbie asked as they headed to the car. He felt a bit strange wondering about courtesy to a ghost, but decided that it might be the least strange thing about the whole case.\n'No, he's forgotten about us by now, I should think,' said James. 'And if anyone saw us we might find it hard to explain what we were doing in the boathouse...'\n                                                                lhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlhlh\n'So that's you two out of the closet,' said Draco, when they'd finished telling him about the case and the immediate aftermath.\n'Yes,' said Robbie, 'but she did say she didn't see anything. I think it might be a bit like that American thing of don\u2019t ask; don't tell.'\n'But you weren't doing anything illegal,' said Draco, puzzled, as usual, by muggle ethics.\n'Not illegal, no, but entirely inappropriate under the circumstances,' said Robbie.\n'Imagine if two of your teachers at Hogwarts were seen kissing near the front door,' said James, in an effort to explain.\nDraco grinned. 'That would have been the subject for delicious blackmail for a long time,' he said. 'You know, I could deal with Innocent's memory for you, wipe just that bit. She wouldn't realise there was any loss, and you'd be back in your safe closet with your professional propriety intact.'\n'Thanks,' said James, 'but I think I'd as soon stay out, now that we're out. She won't do anything in the way of censuring us, and it might be easier if a few people knew.' He looked at Robbie.\n'Yes,' said Robbie,' I think we've hidden long enough. We can let a few close friends into the secret.' He felt thrilled that James was willing to be known to be with him. Thrilled and proud. \n'Besides,' said James, 'we're still in the magical closet. And I hope it will be a very long time before the door to that one opens.'\nDraco smiled, a doubtful sort of smile, as if he knew something. Robbie wondered how long they could keep James' magic from the people they knew well. And of course those were virtually all police. Still, that was a worry for another day. \nEnd."}}, "2744999": {"Updated:": "2015-08-24", "Chapters:": "9/?", "Characters:": ["Peter Jakes", "James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis"], "Words:": "28336", "Title": "The Bells of Oxford", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Bookmarks:": "7", "Fandoms:": ["Endeavour (TV)", "Lewis (TV)"], "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Hits:": "1316", "Kudos:": "52", "Summary": "\nOn endeavourheadcanons, someone made the wonderful suggestion that Peter Jakes could be James Hathaway's uncle, and this is the idea I have taken to be the basis of this piece.James has just left the seminary and meets his uncle in Oxford and finds himself able to talk with and confide in him.

He'd probably never get away from here, would he? Fate's twisted sense of fun would most likely ensure he breathed his last in this city. It never really let you go once it got its hands on you. What was it that Morse used to quote? A twitch upon a thread, that was all it took to bring you back again.\nPeter turned off the car engine and sat for a moment, the late afternoon sun over-sharp as it came through the window. He wouldn't have chosen Oxford to meet but his nephew had been on some religious jaunt in and about the area, so it had made more practical sense for them to meet here. Too many ghosts, Peter thought, patting his jacket pocket for his cigarettes. Before, when he'd been a young man, those ghosts had been bad ones, representing faces and sensations he wanted so desperately to forget. He wasn't sure if these new ghosts were not worse; the phantoms of his former boss, former colleagues and lovers. These were memories he wished were even stronger and brighter. He simultaneously feared their fading and feared his attachment to them. Sergeant Jakes would've scoffed at his retired self and his tendency to get in his memories and lie down in them, something he had sworn he would never do. He got out of the car and approached The Trout.\nThursday had passed away some years ago, found by Joan, appearing to have fallen asleep with his pipe in his lap. And then Joan herself- that had been cruel to Strange, having to watch his wife fade like that. It had been cruel to Joan herself. Such rage had burned in her eyes at how her body could no longer support her. Dr. DeBryn. Then Peter's own wife. Morse. Had it already been nearly three years since Morse had died? The sun beating down gave him no comfort or words of wisdom and the river gurgled on utterly indifferent. Peter had arrived before James and chose a table outside, knowing that they were both smokers. Though of late, in fairness, he had been trying to cut down. He had given them up before but taken it up again the evening he had learnt of Morse's death. He had decided to accept its presence in his life, his need for it while maintaining enough will power to reduce his consumption to a minimum.\nStill, he thought as he settled himself in his seat, having dispatched his order, and lit up a smoke, letting his gaze move over the scenery and those around him. Still, the weather was good, he was going to have a drink (probably have to take a taxi back later, which would be a mild irritation), he was enjoying a smoke. He wasn't in bad health. He was still here. That was alright. Now, he just had to sort out the situation his sister had sent him to sort out. Sinead had called him the previous week, pouring forth a confused story about a sort of family crisis which appeared to centre on his nephew, James. The lad had been a remarkable scholar and a strongly devout Catholic and joining the seminary seemed a natural fit. Yet, his sister was telling him how James had left and it was rather unclear whether he had been kicked out or whether he had chosen to leave. Probably a mixture of both, Peter suspected. \"Could you try talk to him? I don't know what's going on, or what to even say.\" \"Sinead, why would he talk to me?\" Peter had been delighted at becoming an uncle and when James had been small he had regularly given him little presents and treats, like taking him to the cinema. It had been a simple relationship. Peter never wanted to be such a great presence that the lad would feel the lack of him when he couldn't be around, which inevitably happened. He had left Oxford and moved up to London, working steadily on his career, and bringing up his own family. They saw his sister's family at Christmas and any other important family events. He had noticed that his two daughters had never been the best of friends with James. The boy had become more and more a stranger to him as he had grown up. It was partly his own fault. Peter loved his sister; she was one of the very few who knew what it had been like to grow up in a string of institutions and homes. They would always be important to one another, bound by something they could not talk about, yet was always present. The problem was not his sister, but rather that he disliked his brother-in-law. He understood her reasoning in marrying him, though he had yet to admit that to her. He was a bit older than her, a brother of a girl she had worked with. Peter didn't believe that there was much love between them but they were still together. He had given a young Sinead a way out of a life of poverty, had given her security. There was nothing bad about the man. He was simply weak and Peter despised weak people more than bad ones. And he had let his dislike for the man keep him away from his sister too much. She had never questioned him about it and Peter had the suspicion that she was well aware of how her husband was perceived by some. \"Well, since he won't talk to us about it I thought perhaps he'd be more willing with someone who is, I suppose, more neutral.\" Peter could only imagine that the lad would've had a tough time trying to talk to his father. He hadn't asked about his reaction to the whole situation, and nothing more in depth than a few cursory questions. He was determined to come to this unusual situation with as clear a slate as possible. He had no inkling as to what either of the parents, or even James himself wanted as a solution. Were they worried that James was on the slippery slope to dropping out of life? Were they concerned about what career path he might light upon next? Good God, did they want him to praise the advantages of joining the police force? Peter grimaced at his pint. Shadow covered him as a lanky frame placed itself in front of him. \"Uncle Peter\" came a low voice. He watched his nephew folding himself into the chair opposite him, the boy returning Peter's gaze with one that was still and calm but no less intense for that. Boy? He'd have to stop thinking of him like that. Having missed out on those years, Peter found it hard to reconcile the blonde kid he had seen holding onto Sinead's hand with the angular man across from him ordering a whiskey and lighting up a cigarette. All that artless enthusiasm was gone, strangled, or at least forcibly kept in check. Peter remembered his astonishment, and secret pride, when the boy began to show how intelligent he was. Sinead had shaken her head, more baffled than anything else, not quite sure how to deal with his precociousness. He enjoyed being able to tell others things, silly bits of trivia, facts. Sometimes James would get so caught up in an explanation, rushing ahead of himself so as to communicate it to whoever his audience happened to be. Often his father would only be able to tolerate a minimum of this from his son before barking at him to stop being such a know-it-all. Peter had seen the confusion in the boy's eyes at this reaction. He didn't ever get involved. They were James' parents, not him. He was the Uncle who showed up for irregular visits, it wasn't his place to comment.\nHe had sought to restrain himself from giving the lad too many gifts. He didn't want him used to receiving things easily. Yet, when he saw that he had a capacity for his school work and beyond, and how easily he memorised chunks of the bible, Peter found himself giving James presents which he argued were useful, educational, things his parents wouldn't think of giving him. When Peter would come to visit the estate they lived on at Crevecoeur, he would stop off at Blackwell's and pick up a volume of poetry he remembered seeing on Morse's shelves in his bedsit. He hadn't read any of them himself, though he remembered the names of the poets. He remembered Morse quoting it; sometimes he quoted unending lines purely to needle and tease Peter. He would sit at the table, almost empty glass in hand, the uncapped whiskey bottle on the table, head thrown back as he languidly declaimed those words, words which were so very dear to him and were only as much pleasant noise to Peter. He understood it as someone would listen to a beautiful sounding foreign language, or a piece of opera; he didn't need to know exactly what Morse was saying. It went into him and he experienced it that way. There was no point for him in reading those pages now, for they lacked the only thing which had given them meaning- Morse's voice. James had adored the poetry, learning it off and always ready to recite it to his uncle when he came. Sinead told him of how James would have to read the volumes with a dictionary open beside him. He absorbed these new words so rapidly that on occasion she herself had to check the dictionary to keep up with her son's vocabulary.\nPeter had once given him a tape of classical music; he had imagined if the boy liked poetry he would likely enjoy this. He knew the next time he visited though that he hadn't. Nothing direct was said by him about it. He just didn't mention it and Peter never repeated the purchase. He was glad of it really. He didn't want to always associate him with Morse. The child was an individual in his own right; it would be unfair to saddle him with that ghost. As James had grown more and more withdrawn Peter had put it down to receiving slagging from the other boys at school for being brainy. Then had come Cambridge, then the seminary. Sinead had bloody nearly burst with pride. James' whiskey had arrived. Peter decided to lead with a direct question. In his experience, even if you didn't get the answer you were looking for, the reaction to such a blunt ask or the way it was answered could tell you more about what a person was really thinking or feeling. \"Your mum tells me you've packed in the priesthood.\"\"Yes. Got kicked out. Didn't fit anyway.\" came the even response. Peter took a mouthful of his pint, giving himself a moment to consider this. His direct question had been met with an equally direct answer. Or so it would initially seem. But, scratching the surface, Peter found that his nephew had given him an answer that gave no information, a smokescreen, rather. Most people would have let it go, and he assumed that was the intention. Most would've considered a young man joining the priesthood as strange, not the giving up of it. They would understood it as James admitting it to have all been a phase, that he had tried it out and realised like any smart person that it really wasn't for him. Most people would've anyway, and he supposed that this was what James was counting on. And what did that second oh-so-casually thrown out sentence mean? It wasn't even a sentence, Peter mused. He hadn't said \"It didn't fit anyway.\" or \"I didn't fit anyway.\" Nor had it been \"It didn't fit me.\" or \"I didn't fit in.\" Just \"Didn't fit anyway.\" What did that mean? What did you do to \"fit\" at a seminary? Had he tried to make himself fit, like a square peg in a round hole, or rather, had he been told he didn't fit or it didn't fit him? His direct non-answer muddied matters more than clarifying them, but in such a vague way that Peter didn't know quite how go about attacking them. He decided to go away from it for the moment. \"So, you left the seminary and immediately embarked on a religious jaunt?\" A smirk twisted James' mouth, Peter's phrasing of the question amusing him. \"It was more a solitary jaunt, not necessarily religious.\" \"Anti-religious?\" James made a slight grimace, indicating that this was perhaps closer to the mark. \"I didn't want to go back to Cambridge, I didn't want to go back home. I don't necessarily have the funds to go and attempt to find myself in India or wherever it is that is currently in vogue. Thoughts naturally turned to the other side of the academic coin- Oxford. But not the town itself; I went up to the White Horse. Have you been?\" Peter nodded; he still remembered how the evening sun looked setting over the hill, how the grass had smelt and how he had turned and kissed Morse for the first time. The sensation of that memory still touching him, he refocused on James.\"It's a marking left by a pagan religion, isn't it?\" The other details escaped Peter but he retained that much. \"Epona, Goddess of love and fertility. Legend has it that if a woman sleeps on the horse's eye she will fall pregnant.\" That was it, Peter nodded to himself. What would attract James to such a place? And on his own? Did the lad not have a friend, a confidante, someone he could take off with for a mad weekend? Were all his friends those he had made through college or the church? Had he left them all behind? Something shifted into place for Peter and he felt he had at least a piece of the puzzle that was his nephew's current state of mind. \"Were you up there trying to convert to paganism?\" James huffed a breath out through his nose, an almost-snort, mid-drag on his cigarette. \"Something like that.\" He lit another cigarette before continuing. \"Leaving the seminary is such a change of course, such a huge statement. I thought it was what I wanted to do and that I had always wanted it. If I can be mistaken about something so fundamental then I have to seriously examine those other fundamentals which have been a part of my life.\"\"Your faith.\" James nodded, his eyes not entirely meeting Peter's. Something other than his faith then...? He didn't doubt that he wasn't telling him the truth, but he also wasn't telling him everything that was troubling him. The lad seemed uncomfortable. Had he perhaps been too embarrassed to talk about his faith and a crisis with it? Peter didn't believe himself but it was clear that James' faith was something intensely personal to him, something which he wanted to protect and he would not hesitate in retreating into oblique sentences and deadpan sarcasm in order to escape a perceived threat. \"You had to see if leaving the seminary meant leaving your faith as well?\" James nodded again, eyes still not quite focused on his uncle. \"I wanted to go to a place that hadn't been formed by Christianity. To see how it...felt. I imagined it would be conducive to thinking. I wanted to try and spend some days as if I didn't believe.\" James paused for a long time and Peter waited, draining his glass. \"And unfortunately,\" He resumed. \"I can't divorce my faith.\" \"Would you rather not believe?\" \"It's not a case of wanting. I just imagine it is easier not to.\" \"So, the seminary is out, but not your faith.\"\"That would seem to be about as far as I have got, yes.\"\"Any idea about what comes next?\" \"Another drink?\"\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\nThe deep brown-orange liquid waited in front of him and instead, James chewed on his thumbnail. Realising what he was doing he pulled his fingers from his mouth and sought to cover this rather abrupt gesture and the behaviour before it by reaching for the tumbler. His uncle has been on the police force long enough for none of this to have escaped his notice; it was what James admired about him but which also left him a little apprehensive. Uncle Peter certainly cut an impressive figure; though James was now taller than him he still felt himself to be the shorter. His hair had gone fully grey, not a trace of black remaining. The face was lined, making it almost noble, it appeared to James. There was nothing gentle in them, they were sharp lines, deeply dug, not the sweet twinkling of an elderly relative's eyes. There were scarcely any photos of his uncle when he was young, something he had always wondered about. Odd, how obvious his uncle's signs of age appeared to him compared with how he found himself shocked when he realised his own mum was nearly the same age. In his mind, she remained young, yet coming face to face with her was like trying to overlap two mismatching negatives.  It made him aware of his own age more keenly, how he was now an adult and really shouldn't be indulging himself in career changes and worrying others unnecessarily. He chanced a more direct glance at his uncle. In spite of always getting on well with him there had been an element of mystery surrounding him which they had never broken down. James was convinced he had cultivated this intentionally; something in his behaviour told him that Peter wanted to keep himself at a distance from his extended family, and in particular his nephew. James had never worked out if his uncle was afraid for him or rather, afraid of him in a strange way. He had more than enough self-awareness to know that his uncle didn't dislike him. If he disliked anyone it was his father. Well, James could understand that. Perhaps that was unfair- he didn't dislike his father. Or he perhaps just didn't allow himself to dislike him. Maybe one day he would even be able to broach this topic with Peter. James nipped at the whiskey, wanting very much to knock it back in one go, but the worry that a second drink would loosen his tongue too much constrained him. He had a tendency to do that, he had noticed in himself; he was either sphinx-like, not a word passing his mouth, or he would blurt out the most personal information in one dense sentence at the wrong time and usually to the wrong person. That was his other great fault- someone could show themselves to be friendly or appreciative toward him and his sense would go out the window. Grief, he would've made a terrible priest; distant yet trusting and naive by turns. James was sure that it was this lack of balance in him, which he had taken such great measures to hide, that had first alerted his superiors in the seminary to keep a watchful eye on him. He had had a moment when he had, almost in spite of himself, turned to one of his fellow trainees for support and the look of alarm which had crossed his face was still vivid in James' memory. Oh, he couldn't think about all that. He simply didn't have the capacity to be equal to that task. Awful headaches had plagued him in recent months and it was only in the past couple of days that they had really begun to abate. Yet despite the pain, he was not capable of emptying his mind entirely, just as he was incapable of doing utterly nothing. Even if it was a solitary or rather quiet activity, he had to be doing something at least, whether it was cooking, rowing, learning an instrument, cleaning or studying. The timetabled day at the seminary, down to the very minute, had been what he had liked the most, he admitted to himself. He found it comforting and deeply satisfying to be always occupied, and useful; or at the very least, to be engaged in structured activity. When the headaches had faded and some of his ability to reason and worry an argument had returned to him he had consciously chosen to focus on the question of his faith. He had once more banished thoughts of Crevecoeur, of Will McEwan, knowing that if all these things crowded into his mind at once, the house of cards which was his post-seminary life would flutter into sheer nothing. A small part of his mind, bawling incessantly, attempted to turn his attention to how flawed his logic was in this argument; for how did he expect to seriously interrogate or understand his relationship to his religion if he was going to exclude those two aspects from it? Just not now, James asked his empty glass. It was tough enough attempting to make sense of the blur of the past few weeks, never mind his entire life leading up to it. One day he had been in the seminary and the next he was gone and he wasn't entirely sure how that had all rushed by him. He had really only come back to himself when he had reached Oxford and it was a mere three days ago that he'd been able to pray again. Would he be able to explain to Peter the sense of relief that had hit him with a thud at being able to open up that channel again, to turn inside himself and spill forth those phrases which he had always held so dear? James got exasperated with himself for this on occasion; it would appear he was only capable of pouring forth such intense feelings to God without fear of ridicule. Yet his uncle seemed unexpectedly understanding about his religious feeling. Perhaps such a statement could be used as a sort of litmus test and depending on his reaction he could pursue it further or drop it entirely, passing it off with a joke, some sarcasm. \"I wasn't able to pray. I missed it. It's come back to me since I left the seminary.\" He affected a casual air, draped across his seat, one leg over the other, but really he was scrutinising his uncle's face for a hint of scorn.\"Did you have a row with God, or did you just stop talking to him? Or did he do something to piss you off?\" There was no mockery in his words. He posed it as a perfectly reasonable question, wishing to know the nature of the issue and understand precisely what James meant, which was something else he would have to be wary of. \"If I say all three but at the same time none of the above that won't make a heap of sense, will it?\" \"No, but I'm sure you're quite capable of putting it in context for me.\" He wasn't going to let James get away with everything and the sentence was issued almost as a challenge it would seem. So, James took a moment to gather his thoughts and sought to put some shape and narrative onto the matters that had been pressing on him for months now. \"My faith, my approach to religion is very DIY, something I fell into. It was never forced on me. Naturally, there was a bible at home and mum made us go to church semi-regularly. Initially, they were just pretty words and stories that I liked. Then it was almost an exercise out of boredom to memorise chunks of the bible. There wasn't ever a light-bulb moment for me. I think I have always, as far back as I can remember, accepted God. I didn't question that they existed, so it wasn't something to get excited about or look upon as special. It was just there. My deeper preoccupation with it all came about indirectly through the poetry books you would give me. I had never thought to use the dictionary when I was reading the bible. The bible wasn't like other books, it was more like the words to a song which you just knew and repeated, the meaning didn't enter into it. But after I started checking every new word I found in Housman or Clare I began doing the same with the bible. I must've been twelve at the time. We'd just left the estate and so I suspect I had a lot of free time on my hands, not having my old friends or occupations any longer. Each word had so many meanings as to make each tiny story in the bible absolutely epic in meaning. It was a puzzle I couldn't solve, it was unending. Even before I studied theology my fascination was for words and what God was offering in them. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. That has been the basis of, well, everything for me. \"Then when I did get to Cambridge, I was able to pursue my own interests. I could pick and choose what I wished to study and I did that happily. I suppose what I'm trying to explain is that most of my relationship with God when I was younger was free from dogma, it was something I had not really been exposed to. I instead drew on many other faiths, incorporating ideas that appealed to me or that clearly went well with Catholicism and created a patchwork faith. But, the figure I prayed to was very much God, the version of the being I conceived them to be. And prayer was- is- the most important aspect to me. It is my renewing my belief, it's like pouring water on a plant and pruning the leaves. And it is a dialogue- or again, rather, I see it as a dialogue. God has given me words and ideas for life and my prayer is my response to that. I've always seen myself as being religiously in collision with my holy book and that is the basis of my dialogue with God. And that was how I went about with religion, oblivious, until I started at the seminary.\"It was a bloody great shock. I stuck out unbelievably, and it seemed my answers and ideas were always, always wrong. And, well, it's going to sound stupidly school-boyish but I don't like being wrong, or being told I'm wrong. It's embarrassing.\" James stopped for a moment, reminding himself not to tell his uncle everything. If he could be fully honest, he would've told Peter that being told constantly that what he said and thought was wrong had frightened him, shook him to his core, taken him right back to the cold heart of his childhood. \"I suppose, I gave in. The seminary was so insular to begin with and I convinced myself to take on those ideas. And because I had only made my faith out of playing with a dictionary and academic study, nothing directly involved with the church, I considered myself a layman and felt I couldn't justify my clumsy convictions in the face of their authority. Everything had one answer. After a while that was alright. It was comforting to have such certainty. \"The worrying thing is, however, that if this had been the only issue, I believe I would've managed to continue on and completed my training. But since I had taken on these single interpretations, accepted these answers as the one and only, my image of God began to change. He was transformed into this figure that I didn't recognise and didn't like. He left me cold. This figure didn't want to talk to me, didn't want to engage in the dialogue we'd always shared. Rather he was like one of those dolls; you squeeze their hand and no matter how many times you do that they just repeat their same five set responses. It wasn't the case that I chose to stop talking to him; I couldn't talk to him, the possibility was gone. \"And that was what made me want to leave, even if my desire to leave the place was unconscious, unknown even to myself initially.\" He paused again briefly, pushing down the thoughts of the horribly botched conversation which had really made him want to leave the seminary. Will's face flickered to life across his mind and was gone once more. Peter did not need to know about that; even without that information he believed that what he was telling his uncle made sense. \"I continued on. But I was angry. It was as if I were experiencing that moment of childhood, you know, when your toys and imaginary games lose their magic. You lose that ability to believe in their being real. With each day that passed in the seminary I was certain I would lose any last shred of belief I had managed to protect. It would one day no longer be the case that God wasn't talking to me, but that God could never have been talking with me because he had never existed. In many ways, I am a small, limited person. I've never been interested in proving the existence of God or convincing everyone that this is the one truth. My aim as a priest had always been that I would talk to those who would want to listen. Of course, I am interested in the different manifestations of religion throughout history and civilization, but I don't need to have unequivocal proof on the subject. My belief is my own proof. I believe in God; that's all I want to be left alone with. God is where I explore my subjectivity.\"James pressed his lips together, nearly tempted to sit on his hands to prevent himself from biting down on his thumb. He had halted himself mid-flow, just to check that he could still keep his mouth in check. He found himself holding his breath for longer than needed, another pointless act, known only to himself, another test to reassure himself that his thoughts and movements were subject to his will. \"James,\" Peter was regarding him in a deceptively casual way and yet it didn't put him any more on his guard than he had been already. His uncle would say exactly what he felt he wanted to say, he wouldn't hold back for fear of giving offence. He also wasn't a time-waster, so he knew he would be to the point. James could well imagine the bored gaze he must have inflicted on waffling witnesses. \"James, I know any young person hates to be reminded of their youth, especially by an older relative, but do you think that your age could have something to do with you being willing to let the priests at the seminary influence you so much? You're an intelligent man and you know that you are- and yet, it sounds as if you were ready to say that your carefully constructed beliefs were inferior to them. Seems as if you have a problem with authority figures, and I don't mean rebelling against them, I mean submitting to them.\" James couldn't suppress a violent snort. \"I long ago stopped listening to or wanting to please authority figures.\"Peter merely took out his cigarette pack before giving his nephew a sidelong glance. \"Certain authority figures, perhaps.\" James felt ice-cold sweat trickling down his back, his clothes restrictive all of a sudden, the previously pleasant evening now oppressive. He had to get away from that comment. \"What are you saying, that I have a chronic case of being a teacher's pet?\" \"No. I think you're someone who received a lot of praise for being smart and doing well at school, and that you've spent most of your life in an academic setting.\" James rattled the melting ice-cubes in his glass, wishing he could throw the glass against the ground and somehow have a different life to the one he found himself grappling with. \"But that is so insulting to God.\" He managed to bite out, not allowing his words to rush together or his voice to tremble. \"That I would chuck my faith aside for some Ersatz belief merely to get a pat on the head.\"\"It would've been an insult if you'd kept doing it and stayed at the seminary. It would've been an insult if you said one thing to those priests whilst believing something else. You found your way back to your God, you chose it over the seminary, you chose it over being comfortable and remaining somewhere familiar, and somewhere that I think in many ways suited you. If I was God,\" Peter allowed his mouth to smile just a bit. \"I'd be proud of you for doing that.\"James was seized by a near over-powering desire to simply lay his head on the table and weep, but a few seconds passed and he managed to swallow it back down. \"Another?\" Peter indicated their glasses. James shook his head. \"No thanks.\" \"Any immediate plans?\" \"For the first time in my life, no. Not a single one. I think I need to stand still for a bit in order to go forward, if you know what I mean.\" \"As long as there's nothing behind you, waiting to catch up on you.\" Peter said baldly. For the second time in the conversation, all alarm bells were set clanging in James' head. The things his uncle could come out with sometimes, they were absolutely knife-edge close to the bone. Had this been Peter's experience of life? What had his experience been in life? He wasn't equal to such speculation just now. The attempt at picturing how his mum and Peter were together as kids didn't help throw light on this subject, least of all because he simply couldn't imagine them as children. Instead, he allowed his train of thought to be carried off by the sound of the river's movement. \"I do love it here.\" James murmured, not minding whether Peter heard him or not. \"Ach, there's no hope for you.\" Peter said, half-mocking. \"Bound to Oxford for life.\" \"I would like to point out that we are in fact some kilometres from Oxford proper.\" \"No, I'm afraid you're a lifer, like me. A twitch upon a thread and you'll always be back here.\" James jerked in his seat. \"Wouldn't expect a Waugh reference from a Chief Superintendent.\" \"Never expect anything.\" \"What, from you?\" James asked, trying to make the tone of the conversation somewhat lighter. Peter flicked his cigarette butt into the river. \"Perhaps.\"\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\nIn spite of the years passing, and the higher rank that came with them, Peter could never quite shake off the slight uncertainty he experienced when walking into somewhere like a bookshop, or a serious music shop. He put on a good show, of course. His strategy had always been to go in armed with the name of one writer, then find an assistant who was younger than him and issue them with this order; that usually gave the impression that he knew what he was talking about, when in fact, the names meant nothing to him, they were just a collection of words passed on to him by Morse. After the evening in The Trout, Peter found himself returning to the bookshops long left unfrequented, dredging up names from the dusty corners of his memory. He then passed these books onto James, using the excuse of having missed a fair few of the lad's birthdays in recent years. James' face would light up over these gifts, and Peter wondered if it wasn't just him who had been neglecting his birthdays. He knew his sister wouldn't let anyone's birthday pass unnoticed but he could imagine that his brother-in-law perhaps forced family celebrations down to the bare minimum. For mixed with the simple child-like joy at receiving an unexpected present was a certain amount of reserve James attempted to graft on top of his genuine reaction. Somewhere along the way the boy had learnt to be suspicious of gifts, or he had been made to feel embarrassed or ashamed for expressing happiness over them. Or was he maintaining this degree of reservation so as to indicate to Peter that there was distance between uncle and nephew still? Such suspicions were justified on James' part, really. Peter had walked back into his life only during the so-called crisis and at his sister's request. The lad was most likely on high alert, worried that Peter was going to force a particular solution upon him. Could he explain to James the two main reasons he had for this flurry of gift giving? One was merely that he rarely had anyone to give presents to these days. His two daughters were older than James, and too many important others were no longer with him. Even as a young man on a Sergeant's wage he had enjoyed showering his dates and partners with little presents, a magpie himself, seduced by shiny, pretty things. He had always liked that, the wooing process as it were, the courting; quite often he had enjoyed that aspect more than the relationship itself. Secondly, though he tried to deny it and scoffed at the thought, he was concerned about his nephew, and the potential for taking a wrong turn was still present. Even worse, Peter believed that the potential for James to make the right choice but to undertake it in the wrong way was very likely. He hadn't been fooled by the boy; yes, he had been honest with, probably more honest than he'd been with anyone in a long time. However, his faith and the seminary was the not the entirety of the issue- it ran far, far deeper than that. Faith was tied up with it, painfully so, but Peter couldn't even begin to follow the thread back to undo that tangle. It left him wishing he could advise James, tell him what to do to avoid a huge mistake. This wasn't an option. He simply didn't know enough of what was going on to be in a position to dispense advice, not even of the most general sort. Furthermore, he knew that if he gave James blunt advice that James would roll up inside himself as a hedgehog would and that would be that. So, unable to do anything else but needing to be doing something at least, he gave James copies of those books called classics, hoping that words he himself had never read or even wanted to understand, words that had survived for hundreds of years, would contain some form of wisdom that James could latch onto. Also, having gifts to give James allowed him to arrange to meet up with his nephew. Neither of them were at the stage where they felt they could just ring the other up and ask if they felt like having a drink; there always had to be a reason. He liked his nephew, he found, in spite of the prickliness- or was it because of it? Been a long time since he'd had some to properly spar with. This time it had been James who had arranged the meeting. Peter pushed open the door to the music shop, the bag containing the E. M. Forster novels he had purchased for his nephew slapping against his calf as he moved. This time the books would act as a housewarming gift; James had told him that he'd got himself a job working in a music shop, which meant he could now afford to find his own small flat. The job was clearly a stop-gap but Peter though it was a good idea, get the lad out doing something. Even better for him to get out of the family home and spend some time in a place of his own, a place that was not on campus or in the seminary. When James had told him he was working in a music shop, Peter had assumed he meant a place which sold CDs and the like. Instead he was in a shop which dealt with instruments; guitars hung on the walls and strange pieces of paraphernalia filled the floors and shelves, items whose function Peter could not even guess at. He hadn't realised James had any sort of knowledge on actually playing music. Scanning the shop, he finally caught sight of James and was slightly startled to see he had shorn off his hair; all that remained was a blondish sheen, a hint of hair. Appearing even more serious than before, he looked harder and more angular. The shop was emptying out and James was clearly preparing to leave. James looked up and caught sight of Peter. He smiled by way of greeting, a smile that inevitably seemed more a of a smirk on James. \"Are you trying to look like a monk again or something?\" Peter nodded at his nephew's head. The smirk deepened and he responded once they were outside the shop and he had locked the door. \"Seminary chic. I hear it's all the rage these days. Wouldn't want to get left behind now, would I?\" Peter still couldn't work out if James being sarcastic was an indicator of a positive or negative mood or reaction. He wasn't certain he ever would know.\nFollowing the lad down the road, he found himself having to make some effort to keep up with him. James hadn't noticed and Peter would be damned if he'd admit it to him. The flat they entered was on the ground floor, small; however, it was clear James had already been hard at work on it. Devoid of furniture except for the essentials, the walls were painted the palest yellow, and neatly lined book shelves and carefully stacked CD towers had been discreetly put up. No photos. A guitar case was propped in the corner. Peter flicked his eyes briefly over the shelves; alphabetised, of course. A small \"hmph\" escaped from Peter in place of a smile when he realised James had kept all the books he had given him, even from back when he was a small child. The bible was there, naturally. Not a fancy copy though, probably the same copy he'd had all his life. Peter could only imagine what the bedroom looked like. James placed two glasses and a bottle of whiskey on the table. They sat, facing each other, both lighting up their cigarettes at the same time. \"You like it?\" \"What, the flat? Yeah.\" Peter nodded his head. \"Not for me, mind you, but I like it. It's a bit minimalist, is that the word?\" \"It's just what I wanted.\" James was pouring out the whiskey for them, generously. \"I got the job and then I knew I could afford to get somewhere of my own. Cleaning out my room was fantastic. Probably chucked about half of the stuff, left behind this empty room. It was stripped bare, as if no-one had been there, no traces whatsoever.\" He paused to swallow half of his whiskey. \"Nice to be able to let go of things so easily.\" \"Some things can be, yes.\" Peter expelled the smoke from his mouth in one concentrated stream. \"My parents were delighted.\" James skipped lightly over Peter's comment. \"I think they're convinced that everything's sorted now, that I'll just do this,\" He gestured vaguely around him. \"for the rest of my life and it will all be fine.\" \"But you have no intention of that.\" \"For now. It's great. I'm enjoying it. Having an income is a decent situation to be in. Nice to live on my own. But it is a transition, a facilitation of sorts.\" \"To...?\"\"To the next thing, whatever the next thing will be.\" Peter said nothing, seeing the lad had fallen inexplicably into a contradictory mood. Was this because he had started talking about his family or the future? What had set it off? His comment? Better to wait for him to start talking again. \"You think I'm wasting my potential.\" \"I think you could potentially be wasting your potential.\" Peter parried. \"You think I'm throwing my education away, I suppose.\" \"No, but you seem to be unsure on that one yourself.\" \"Just because I'm good at something, doesn't mean I have some obligation to dedicate my life to it. I could be a gifted piano player but nowhere does it say that I have to become a concert pianist if I don't want to.\" James' lip was almost quivering in barely concealed disgust. Peter was somewhat taken aback by such a strong reaction, yet he continued to sit quietly and smoke. Everything was so raw with James at the moment, or nearly raw. It all lay just below the surface, a tumult scarcely remaining under water, a breath away from breaking through. Peter could well understand that feeling. This time instead of saying nothing, he decided to press the sore spot; he was curious to see what his reaction would be at least, even if nothing else productive came from it. \"I thought you played guitar.\" He said casually. \"Or can you play piano too?\" \"I could. Used to be able to. Didn't like it. I was good at it. But I hated it.\" James poured himself another measure of whiskey; he appeared to drift off for a split moment, eyes unfocused, forgetting to refill Peter's glass. For most people that lapse would've gone undetected, but Peter noted it, not knowing how to understand it. \"Actually, I think you've been having a greater influence on me than you know. I've been considering joining the police.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Yes.\" James retorted, miffed somewhat. \"Do you think it's not a good option?\"\"It's certainly an option.\" \"You chose it.\" \"Ah, well, things were different for me.\" \"How so?\" James challenged. \"All I mean...look, I didn't have the same opportunities as you when I was young. Perhaps things weren't so easy for you, yes, I'm aware, but still, it was better than what I had. Honestly, James, my father, your grandfather, died when we were kids and mum, my mother, well- nowadays, I suppose it would be called a breakdown. Back then it was called taking to your bed. I ended up in a series of state run homes. When I left, I didn't have very many choices. The police was one of them and I went for it, straight off.\"There it was. Part of his grubby, unspectacular childhood. Why had he done that? Wanted to show James that nothing is at it seems. Useful tool for life, especially for the police. He tried to gauge James' reaction. Clearly this was the first time he had heard any of this. His brow was furrowed, eyes cast down towards the table, slouching even further down in his chair. \"That means that mum went through homes as well?\" He was merely looking for confirmation of this. Peter nodded. \"Listen. Don't talk to your mum about it. Best to let on that you don't know.\" \"Why?\" Oh, James really had moments when he sounded an utter child. \"Because people generally don't like knowing that someone has told their secrets to others.\" Peter paused to light up another cigarette. \"Also, me and your mum have never even spoken about that time to each other.\" James was focused quietly on this piece of information, worrying it, reviewing all he knew in light of it. Peter watched him as his concentration grew deeper. Sure, he had plenty of qualities which would make him a good copper- and plenty others which would make the job the wrong fit for him. Bloody hell. Peter touched his fingertips to his forehead, a futile gesture to ward off the unasked for reminder of Morse.\nThat'd be James' problem, not being able to knock around with the other blokes, or take a slagging, soften his sharp corners. Life would be consistently awkward and downright tough for him on the force. The police wasn't a natural fit. Perhaps though, that was exactly it, Peter thought. Perhaps he wanted to deliberately place himself in a situation where he would constantly be thought a square peg in a round hole, where he would always be considered the odd man out. An act of self-defense, of insurance- he wanted to be viewed as odd and have the blame put on how he was ill-fitted to the job. He did not want to be in such a situation where his sense of being marked could be traced back to somewhere, something else. He wanted no questions asked. Wouldn't be an entirely ill-fit though, Peter mused. Police work demanded patience, meticulousness, a certain type of intelligence. James was difficult to read, which would be good in interviews. Be good for office politics- it would also be bad for office politics. Perhaps the idea wasn't so very bizarre after all. \"Which do you think is a worse fate?\" James sighed out cigarette smoke. \"To have someone tell your secrets to others, to tell them for you, or to never tell them?\" Peter reached for another cigarette and finding his packet empty, reached for James'. Peter had forced himself to tell Morse about Blenheim Vale, did it in spite of himself, going against everything he had taught himself once he had left the place. Regret was not one of the emotions he had experienced when Morse's face contorted into a painful mixture of outrage and compassion. Poor Morse, he'd been utterly clueless as to how to help but he had tried, tried and on many occasions had got it wrong. Yet, mixed in with Morse's bumbling attempts, there had been moments of real solace. \"I honestly don't know. Depends though, doesn't it? What counts as a 'someone'?\" Peter eventually replied. \"Your fellow man, surely?\" \"Does God not count then in this? Is praying, or confession even, not meant to be an act of laying yourself bare before God?\" \"God knows all our miserable, mortal secrets already, that's not the point of confession or prayer. It is the act of telling; in telling and making yourself vulnerable to God, you are admitting that you are conscious of the truth of what you're saying and accepting of it.\" \"So, God listens and he approves of such prayers?\" Peter was intrigued by James' faith, about how the lad expressed himself on the subject. \"He's a facilitator in this situation?\" \"Yes. Which is why I think having someone tell your secrets is worse. There is nothing good involved in it, nothing better than just a love of scandal or demonstrating power over another person by taking their story from them. There is nothing in that act which betters the person from whom the secret has been taken.\" Peter looked at his nephew, who was lying back in his chair, his gaze turned upwards, cigarette at his lips, his other hand balancing his glass on his thigh, and he realised that it was possible James would never tell the secrets he held to anyone except his God.\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\nThough he'd lit up a cigarette the very moment he had stepped outside of the police station, James didn't enjoy it. Of course, a show was made of enjoyment; he stood nonchalantly outside the main doors, his first case behind him, and lit up; left hand in his pocket, cigarette held between forefinger and thumb, shoulders rounded, head angled down as he took a drag. This was a stance adopted by James long ago and practiced repeatedly so as to become second nature. An awareness of others watching him wasn't the decisive factor- it was that they potentially could be viewing him which contributed to his need for this pose. He also feared breaking character, toppling the image he was cultivating for himself. James had long ago learnt that you could act your way into a feeling. He had already convinced his body and one day, through repetition and sheer bloody-mindedness, he would convince his mind as well that he was enjoying this smoke under what he believed were many hostile eyes. He took no satisfaction from the inhalation of nicotine until he was far out of sight of the police station. It had always been like this and probably always would be; in this lifetime, at least. James had resigned himself to this continuous struggle between his mind and his body, and to the need to discipline that irrational, unruly vessel with which he was obliged to navigate through the world. Why couldn't his body be other than what it was? A certain disappointment regularly made itself felt, over the state of the frame he inhabited. It was just so bloody awkward, and attention-seeking, without even wanting to be. Did he have to be so tall and gangly, all legs and a head above those around him, always? Did he have to be so blonde? It never failed to make him feel silly and undermined on some fundamental level. Apparently, the way he was put together was considered by many others to be aesthetically pleasing, even enticing, which he utterly recoiled from. Yet, he didn't want to insult or offend his maker by denying or modifying his physical self, though he did have to question why He had seen fit to shackle him with this. He could never fathom as to why he had been forced to live in a body which had attracted such sinful reactions, a body which seemed impossible to reconcile with his mind, his soul. If only his body had been as easy to school as his mind was. One thing James Hathaway did not lack for, and that was discipline and focus; he had applied both assiduously in taking his body to task and yet, the results were temporary at best, it had so far proved. He had trained himself to master his ridiculously long limbs, to walk casually and easily through the world he occupied; he no longer accidentally elbowed those near him or clocked his head on doorways. He blamed this residual inability to negotiate space on his childhood reaction to his first growth spurt, followed by the onset of puberty; his reaction had been to simply pretend it wasn't anything to do with him. This frame might have been his but that did not mean he had to acknowledge it; such was his reasoning when young. He had to pay for that later as he learned to reacquaint himself with dealing with a physical body that needed to be displayed and deployed for professional purposes.\nShaving his head had lent him a sense of appearing more serious, less soft and silly. Having spent much of his life scorning the idea of fashion (and not necessarily having the funds to waste on such items), he had realised they could be utilised to project a professional image. He had invested a hefty amount of his earnings from the music shop into purchasing suits, shirts, ties, the lot. Some would've called the deliberateness in his choice of attire a touch too thought-out, or even glamorous, but James countered that worry by reminding himself that a word such as \"glamour\" implied distance, a certain unapproachable aura.He knew it to be wrong, and yet he could not prevent himself from experiencing moments of blind jealousy of those who didn't have to wage a daily battle as he did, those who moved with their bodies unthinkingly, oblivious to how much hell it was for him sometimes. Not that he wanted anyone to ever have an inkling of that. There were rituals he needed in relation to his body, to keep it under control, to keep it clean and serving a function and no more than that. If he didn't act vigilantly, it would betray him; in spite of all the years his mind had exerted its control over it, he still had moments when his body's reactions, or the sensation of something, or even another's reaction to it would set off connections and long disowned memories which then sought to force their way back in. In those extreme moments only extreme actions would suffice to put everything back in order. This was how he rationalised his sporadic application of lit cigarettes and blades to his own flesh (flesh which had been marked already). He knew it would grieve Him when he took such measures against himself but he had to. There was just no other solution in those overwhelming moments. Certain religious orders more than approved of such acts of bodily mortification. In his more despairing moments, when even repeated prayer made little headway, he was aware he was a mere step away from attacking his own body, his face, wanting to tear from it whatever it possessed which was labelled \"attractive\". He wished for a different relationship to his body, an easier one. These thoughts, however, remained meaningless wishes, not prayers. He only prayed for those things which he felt he was capable of changing, or at least held some hope for. It would've been nice to have a body like his new Inspector- and James was aware how strange that statement might sound, and how most others would receive it, yet that was not how he intended it. It was nothing like that- rather, he experienced a strong wish to stand at this man's side, a mixture of wanting to stand alongside him as a colleague, and another odd sensation, of feeling his Inspector to be taller than him, though this was not the reality. The older man seemed to be so quietly certain in himself, years of care and worry wonderfully sewn into his face in a way different to Uncle Peter- his Uncle's appearance was impressive, commanding respect and a certain distance. The Inspector's lines had been put there out of a deeply held compassion, a fundamental kindness and keenly felt sense of right and wrong. James liked the unapologetic presence of this man, and coveted it for himself, knowing he would likely never attain it. So great had been this pull towards the older man, it had caused him to rashly put forward the offer of first refusal. James would normally have shrunk from such pushy behaviour, yet something told him that Inspector Lewis would not say no. That had to mean something good about him, didn't it, if someone like Inspector Lewis actually agreed to work with him, to take him on. ------------------------------------------The following weekend James made the short trip to London to visit his Uncle. He knew Peter would enjoy hearing about his new job, in spite of his initial (and perhaps residual) skepticism. He hadn't visited Peter's apartment in London and he was intrigued to see him in his adopted city. James couldn't understand what Peter found in London; he had never liked the city, so jumbled and crushed together and harsh. Long, unbroken lines or pleasing arches and curves had always been more to his taste, and widely spaced apart buildings. Probably one of the reasons why he found himself so at home in Oxford- the houses there were regular and neat, and not only was there room for greenery and water, here old relics were valued- the graveyards, their churches, the high-ceilinged libraries. He reveled in this, often standing at his window as the sun set, calmness pouring into him. Of course, on Peter's salary, he was living in a swish part of London and James knew he took a slightly childish delight in the impression his address gave. He was admitted to the apartment and while Peter furnished the table with glasses and a bottle of Springbank Scotch, James surreptitiously snooped through the flat, allowing his eyes to roam over everything. The place was very clean, overly so; yet though the surfaces shone, a nonchalant untidiness was apparent. Interesting. A man who took pride in his surroundings and his appearance but treated them carelessly at the same time. Had to be a cleaning lady who did most of the work around here. It wasn't that his Uncle was a slob, rather, quite the opposite. This was disdain, signalling that he was above such petty concerns as cleaning his own floors. It also seemed an act to demonstrate how lightly he held his possessions, and how they did not possess him. The scant regard he gave his flat was a distancing act, a show of power. If Peter had to move tomorrow- fine. He could get another place, no problem. What was there to hold him here anyway? There were no photographs on display, yet James was certain that they were hidden elsewhere. Peter would never share something so personal and precious as photos with whomsoever should enter his flat. James simply didn't keep photos, having no use for them. Why would he want to see a representation of himself, or of others whom he used to know? Peter, he imagined, took his photos out in secret and enjoyed them, greedily. His Uncle continued to be an enigma to him. This did not mean he wanted to 'crack' any code in relation to him. James was happy for Peter to simply be a presence in his life. The sense of a distance was almost what drew him to his Uncle, if he was going to be harshly honest. He felt secure enough that Peter would remain consistent in his detached attitude, and though he might probe and jab with his prickly, or at other times, opaque comments, James believed he would never truly make an attempt to bridge that unnamed gap. However James knew this only covered a steely centre- he would not have been able to stand up to his Uncle in a police interview. The information about his mum's childhood had come as a shock to him, though he sought not to dwell on it too deeply. He had not ever heard his mother make so much as a passing hint or reference to these circumstances. James wasn't shocked by that so much- in his family, they hardly discussed anything. Indeed, the closest they had come to admitting that there had been a 'crisis', as James called it in his head, had been his mum's turning to Peter for help. Perhaps there was another layer to Peter's attitude to his apartment and its upkeep; having come from such a background, he refused to subject himself to work such as that and he took pride in being able to pay for someone else to do it. James, however, had grown up more without than with and yet, would recoil at someone undertaking such work for him. He would always do his own cleaning, not least because he found it calming, almost hypnotic. It quieted his nerves and made his mind blank for a time. Also, the thought of having a stranger pawing through his private space caused him nearly to shudder. Peter had poured a healthy measure for them both. \"So, I suppose a toast is in order? Congratulations Sergeant.\"James raised his glass too, and allowed himself a pleased smile which he knew always manifested itself as a smirk no matter what he did. \"How was your first case? Heard you got the right person just too late.\" James nodded, knowing his Uncle was throwing out such a line merely to see how he reacted. Perhaps before this case, and before embarking on his new career, he would've risen to it, would've hotly retorted and shown too much of himself. Now, after having once more accustomed himself to repressed sniggers, to rolled eyes and nudges between those who thought he wasn't looking, after open displays of mockery and acts of exclusion, he was able to sit and not allow a muscle to flicker in reaction. The body under control once more; good to know it hadn't forgotten. However, he now had something to hand, to demonstrate to Peter that he was willing to ask something too, to throw out a comment merely to see how the other reacted. \"My Inspector knew someone you worked with.\" James said in a neutral voice. \"Oh?\" Peter scarcely looked up from attending to his unlit cigarette and taking that first all-important drag on it once lit. James mirrored Peter's actions, taking his time before replying. \"Yes. When Inspector Lewis was still a Sergeant, his Inspector was Morse. You worked together, didn't you?\" James knew Morse had passed away some years back; his new Inspector clearly mourned his mentor, compounding his grief at his wife's death, grief which came off him in waves. James would never say such things to Inspector Lewis, just to see his reaction. He was too good for that. Not that Peter was a bad person- somehow, he made James want to say potentially explosive things and he could not explain why. He watched Peter carefully; a light smile had touched his thin lips, a slight snort escaped him and James knew that his Uncle could see something right now that he couldn't. \"Me and Morse worked together, back in the '60s, before I went to London, before I went to Northern Ireland even. A constable from Carshall-fucking-Newtown who came in and became the golden boy. Awkward, arrogant sod.\"\"You didn't like him?\" The smile blossomed a shade more. \"No. No, I didn't. But- we had an odd relationship. In fact, he was the one into all the books and poetry. Anything you've ever been given by me was indirectly through Morse. They were all his favourite writers. He's the reason I tried to force that bloody opera on you.\" James found himself liking the image of the man which Peter and Lewis were conjuring up for him. He wondered what Morse had looked like. \"Inspector Lewis told me he was a crossword fanatic.\" Peter shook his head, as if in disbelief at the memory. \"Totally gone on them. Couldn't talk to him if he had one in front of him. Ridiculous things that man knew.\" \"Did you lose contact with him? Have a falling out?\"It was Peter's turn to pause, sipping on his Scotch and surveying James over the rim of his glass. \"No. No, not anything like that. Difficult to put into words, even now.\"James tried to run through the various possibilities in his mind as to what could've disturbed their relationship. \"See, we were together for about a year, and it was always going to be a little difficult after that. Not that we ever called it a relationship, even in our own minds, I'm sure. Couldn't tell anyone about it either, it would've meant the end for both of us on th force. I always intended to leave Oxford anyway, and well, time passes...\" \"Together.\" James echoed, not even having taken in the words that had come after this. \"Yes.\" \"As in...physically? A physical relationship? You had a physical relationship with him?\" Peter shook out another cigarette. \"I somehow sense that this is not the usual young person's horror at hearing about an oldie's sexual conquests, but rather a more religious objection to the fact that I lay with another man?\" James had flinched at the phrase \"sexual conquest\" but otherwise remained still. \"I never would've picked you as buying into all that.\" Peter continued. \"When you said all that about being influenced by other faiths I somehow imagined you wouldn't be-\" Peter took a drag on his cigarette. \"-I don't even know what word I'm looking for here. Strict? Unwordly?\" He drawled. \"Do you have a problem with my beliefs?\" James challenged. \"Not at all lad, not at all. But it might be a bit of an issue for you. I doubt you want to spend more time with me, now that you've judged me.\"\"I'm not judging you.\" \"Yes, you have. You may as well have already left the room.\" \"How can you tell me about that so...unashamedly?\" \"Because I've had enough shame in my life already and I'm too old to waste any more time on it. Why are you so very ashamed for me? You going to go home now and pray for my soul or something since I'm too gone to do it myself?\" \"Don't mock me.\" James hissed. \"I'm not mocking you, I'm trying to ask you what is your problem with this? I've slept with an equal number of women. Does that make it better or worse? You are aware that your cousin's gay? She came out to me a while back, so you might want to avoid her from now on.\"\"Why do you have to throw it in my face? Why make everything about it a defining statement?\" \"I don't think sexuality or my sexual history defines me and that's not how I'm trying to put it across. But Morse was quite an important person to me and I felt like telling you about him. If I'm going to tell you about him, I can't leave it out.\"\"Yes, you could've. You told me because you wanted to see how I'd react.\"\"And if I did? Your reaction has been extraordinary, to say the least.\" James stood up in one abrupt movement, Peter remained sitting. \"I have to leave.\"\"I expect you do.\" James stood uncertainly for a few moments more, waiting for Peter to say something, to make another gesture, to not leave it like this, to give him some reason to yell at him and resolve never to see him again. He was denied this easy escape as the silence continued. ----------------------------------------------------James returned to the almost cloistered silence of his own flat, gratefully locking the door behind him. His night was restless, his sleep light and constantly broken by oppressive dreams; nightmares, rather, filled with over-sharp shafts of sunlight, painfully bright and refracted through large windows, the smell of dust and sun-warmed wood and ancient ivory, the sickening sensation of something solid yet soft pressing insistently, pushing him down. He awoke, choking and had to rush to the bathroom to void his stomach of what little content it contained. He remained in an ungainly heap on the bathroom floor, struggling to rid himself of the taste of the night. It had been so long since he had had that dream, and now it was back. Why had his Uncle's revelation provoked this in him? James had sworn to himself to never react in such a way again; the unacknowledged memory of Will's visit to him surrounded him but he would not allow it to speak. He slowly pulled himself into a standing position and supporting himself on the bathroom sink, admitted to himself that whatever the answer might be he was not even strong enough to ask the question of himself.\n", "5": "\nChapter Text\nIt was not that Peter recognised too much of himself in his nephew- they were utter opposites in many ways. Rather, he perceived a similar pain in James that he had once experienced. The lad had stood there, a scarcely repressed panic shining in his eyes. Peter had been transported back more than forty years, back to a dingy office where he stood face to face with Deare, and he recalled how he had frantically schooled his features into a neutral expression and had got himself out of there as quickly as fucking possible, catapulting himself headlong into the worst bender of his life. He wondered how James was going to deal with the crisis his words appeared to have set off in him. He couldn't pinpoint whether James would run from a like course of action or whether he would also resort to obliterating himself. He had the potential for both in him Peter believed. There was little he could do to help him; he would just have to let the boy have his time alone, no matter what damage he might wreak. He knew he would come back. In spite of his reaction, Peter was convinced it was not what he had said that had upset James, it had been something in the lad already which had been unsettled. If that was the precarious state he was in something, sooner or later, would've induced this break. Peter poured himself another measure of Scotch, and found his thoughts wandering to Morse. It was all to easy to conjure up the image of that spiky young man, strawberry-blonde head bent over a crossword, brow furrowed, blue eyes focused intently. But if he started with that, it all came back in an unstoppable rush, kisses exchanged, moments snatched as he pushed Morse into an empty hallway, fingertips barely grazing knuckles, the sound of strange music, of trains departing. His memories were not touched by regret- Peter often had to pull himself back from wanting to get in them and lie down, like Dorothy among the poppies in Oz. He would never allow himself to- Morse had had a tendency to fritter away his life in such a maudlin manner. Yet some days he could not resist the warmth that those memories brought- Christ knew he had enough that he wished he could forget. He was beginning to suspect that his nephew was trying to flee from his own memories and closely guarded secrets, or rather, master them. Certain suspicions had formed in his mind but for now he would keep them to himself. It was much too early to try and press James on it. He also hoped to hell he was wrong about what was sickeningly nagging at him. ----------------------------------------------------Retirement did not suit Peter Jakes. After less than a year of being a \"pensioner\" (a term he would bloody well never allow to pass his lips) he found himself restless, easily irritated and much too likely to snap at waitresses and shop assistants. Then he would catch sight of his reflection as he passed a window on the street and grimly understood how he must have appeared to those young people- a grumpy old man. Old age was something which didn't belong to him. He experienced it as an armor tacked on to him, ill-fitting. He struggled to fill his days. Daily the newspaper was consumed thoroughly as he sat down to lunch in a quiet pub. He took in the details of ongoing cases and occasionally forgot his retired status and caught himself making notes about possible avenues to explore on the back of a coaster. The idea of pursuing \"hobbies\" or taking up an allotment was distasteful to Peter- it seemed so very pointless, mindless; he may as well just commit himself to an old folks home if he was going to go down that route. His major indulgence was his love of the cinema and that had been a constant since he was a child. Many films left him cold these days, yet he still went to them, in pursuit of that magical escape it had always provided him with. The stars, for the most part, remained glamorous, which was all he really demanded. His eldest daughter had recently even shown him how to work a DVD player and he was secretly chuffed with this machine, and regularly passed his evenings watching his old favourites, especially anything with Monty Clift. He had more time to visit his old friends and family, yet sometimes passed up on this. His daughters, though taking more after their mother, had inherited one trait at least from their father- an almost fanatic need for independence. He did not want to trespass on them too often due to that. They were young and ambitious, making their way in the world. He remembered what that had been like.\nSome days he had idle thoughts about dating again but he dismissed them anew each time they arose. Too set in his ways now, too old- and still missing others who had departed too much. It had only been in the past few days that he was able to grudgingly admit to himself that he missed his nephew. Funny how quickly you got used to having someone around. Hearing about life in Cowley Station and the cases he took on had spilled excitement into his routine days, had fed that deep interest which had never fallen entirely dormant. He missed him, sharp edges and all. It had been over two months now since James had stormed out of his flat-there'd been no contact between them. Peter was still confident that eventually the lad would be ready to talk to him again. He was certainly taking his sweet time about it. Peter decided to visit his sister, and by these indirect means, perhaps learn of what his nephew had been doing these past months. Sometimes the line between the past and present was so fine as to hardly exist. Peter often felt that strange sense of blurring, or of two images laying on top of one another when he would meet with his sister. She was older than him and yet too often it was not this woman he saw before him but the nineteen year old who had met him when he first managed to get out of those institutions and homes. They had never talked about those years, had never addressed the subject directly. He was never one to allow such a weakness as self-deception in himself- his experience of the world had been too harsh for that luxury. Yet when it came to his sister, he allowed himself to believe that she had not encountered what he had as a child. He could not ask her, would not. This cowardice sickened him when it forced its way into his consciousness. He sought to placate these pangs by reasoning with himself that Sinead was doing fine, more than fine. He feared that his nephew was not. \"How's James?\" Peter asked her once they were settled in the kitchen. \"Oh, really well. Hardly see him he's so busy. But he's always full of news and stories when I talk to him. I think he's taking to life on the police force.\" She smiled at Peter. \"Runs in the family perhaps.\" She seemed calm, content- her worries about her son had certainly been stilled. Was that how James had wanted it? Having witnessed the panic and stress his leaving the seminary had caused, had he strategically acted settled and steady to shield his parents? No, not his parents. This had been an act of self-preservation. Those around him were getting too close (and for James it appeared that too close was a great, great distance) and so he had done his best to drive them back. He clearly hadn't mentioned anything of his abrupt exit from his uncle's apartment. Not that Peter had thought of this as likely anyway. Sinead even mentioned how much of a positive impact she felt Peter was having on James. \"Maybe I should've just stuck to giving him books.\" He replied but in such a way that she took it as a joke and laughed softly. -----------------------------------------------------------------It took another three weeks before James showed up at his apartment. Peter quickly appraised him- he stood stiffly, as if he was focusing on holding this position, wishing to take up as little space as possible but simultaneously hoping to project a lofty confidence. His long body was even leaner than before and his shaved head threw his prominent cheekbones into stark relief. Dark shadows were visible under his eyes. The lad was exhausted. Probably taking on too much at work, compounded then by this constant struggle he waged against himself. Peter stood back and welcomed James into the flat. He sat down on the couch but his foot was continuously twitching and he bit compulsively at his thumb. Peter watched his nephew, experiencing a certain alarm at how on edge he was. Usually James would've managed to cover such a raw state and Peter was consumed by a wave of pity for this lonely boy. And what could he offer him? He could talk and listen, give advice certainly. But he would never be capable of providing him with anything more, he couldn't even comfort the lad and he knew without even asking that James would not be capable of accepting as much as a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. James denied himself comfort- even the act of biting his thumb, Peter imagined, had been how he trained himself not to suck it, transforming a child's act of self-soothing into punishment. \"I came here to apologise.\" James issued these words in a good imitation of his usual tones. \"I am sorry for anything I said, and any offence or hurt it gave you.\" Peter sat in an armchair across from James. No other distractions were on offer for this visit. Something had prevented him from offering his nephew a drink. Whatever would come out of this conversation he felt it would be best if it took place without booze.\"James, I'm glad you came back. There's nothing to forgive- no offence, but your words do not have enough power to hurt me.\" James tilted his head towards his uncle, a deep frown distorting his features. Peter wasn't lying to him, he truly meant what he said. It was only the manner in which James had reacted which had caused him concern. Personally he had been unaffected by anything the lad had said. He was still young and inexperienced enough to believe that everyone around him took what he said as seriously as he did himself, and that they took it the way he intended. \"The issue isn't really your apologising, though I know your church is very much into the whole forgiveness and penance thing.\" James set his mouth in a grim line, his face darkening further at these words. \"It's rather the attitude you expressed. If still feel as you did before about deviant sexualities,\" Peter widened his eyes in mock theatricality \"well then we're going to have some problems.\" James did not respond straight off, and was clearly working out what he wanted to say. \"I don't have a problem with that.\" He made a vague hand gesture. For someone who held words so very dear this particular omission was quite telling. \"What I said came out all wrong and I was also more than a little surprised by the revelation.\" \"What, do I not look like what you imagine, all lisping and simpering?\"\"No, no, of course not. I would never buy into such crude stereotypes.\" James retorted shortly. \"I think I was disappointed in myself and I tried to blame you for my own lack. There was a time, in the seminary, when I let myself get swept along by the specific and narrow interpretations of the bible that certain individuals and groups follow. Since I left I've been trying to unlearn all that because I know it's wrong. But my knee-jerk reaction showed that I haven't made as much progress as I'd like to think I have.\"James fell silent. Peter believed this wasn't the entirety of the issue but he also believed that it was the only aspect the lad even recognised and could give voice to at this point in time. James was attempting to put into words something which he hadn't even clarified to himself yet. James' fingers scrabbled at the sides of his head seeking purchase in the barely there strands, wanting to yank at them. \"It's so frustrating when I have this irrational reaction to something I've been working hard on to change.\" \"Well, the best way to combat irrationality is to rationalise it out of existence. Reason with it, question it until the irrationality has nowhere to hide. What shocked you- the fact that I'd tell you about my previous partners? That I had them?\"His hands remaining where they were James nodded slowly to the second statement, appearing troubled by this admission. It was such a childlike reaction to be so very unsettled by change, expecting those around him to conform to the roles he expected. That could be a huge obstacle in his career. This inability to cope with unexpected revelations in even his family members made James' apparent lack of friends more comprehendable. It also raised the question as to what had brought about this great need for sameness and predictability in those around him. Oddly enough, it would also serve to make him a good police officer- the flip side of such a demand for transparency would be constant distrust of appearances. He could see James working near obsessively on a case so as to put all the facts in order, demystify the motives and ascribe the correct roles to those involved. He could already foresee over-work being James' main vice. His DI should be on the watch for that. James seemed to do battle so intensely with these two parts of himself, the one side which could entertain complex ideas and vast landscapes of thought, quietly tolerant but always interrogating, and the other side which was rigid, inflexible and seemingly unnerved by any uncertainty. The two met like cold and hot and James, in his current state, was the steam which emerged from this. Small wonder he looked so worn out. The energy it must take to place such demands on himself and to be all the while disappointed in himself for not meeting these contradicting standards. Of course James found such comfort in his God- he had partially shaped his conception of him, and he would never unsettle him by revealing any all too human weaknesses. It was as though he had been arrested in childhood somewhere and James was forced to drag this child version of himself along with him, the adult hampered and maimed by the panicky boy still in him. Peter understood all too well such a split. It had taken him over fifteen years to even acknowledge the Little Pete who would take over his rational self, and even longer to stop rejecting him, and instead learn how to deal with him and quieten him. He had never been able to like this ugly reminder of his childhood. Little Pete was the label he gave to all his feelings of being out of control and destructive. Little Pete was when unstoppable memories assaulted him and he had to swallow down huge panic; it was the voice in him which repeated \"I can't, I can't\" over and over He'd taught himself to view this Little Pete as something separate from him, and when he threatened to take over he'd visualise himself picking up his small self and setting him down somewhere safe, and telling him to go off and play and not to bother him. Perhaps Peter was then wrong to try and help James with this by way of reason. Reason could only appear to the adult in James and it was clear that this adult was not always in control. How was he to reason with a child? James would listen and see the validity in what he was saying and would then only be further disappointed in himself when he couldn't apply this logic. The appeal should be made rather to feelings, sensations. That was all Peter himself could remember about being in Blenheim Vale- not words. Words had been blanked out by what had happened there. He changed tack. \"James, was it that you felt it was somehow 'bad' of me?\" Peter asked.\"Bad? No, it doesn't make you bad in itself...\" James began but was cut off again.  \"I don't mean inherently bad. Did you perhaps think I'd been unfaithful to my wife or had lied to others, had treated others unfairly? I never did anything like that. I was never unfaithful to your Aunt, and when Morse died I told your cousin about exactly what he had been to me. My inclinations have never hurt anyone.\" Peter found himself reaching repeatedly for words such as 'bad', 'hurt' or 'unfair'. He felt they would be easier understood by the more childish part of James which currently seemed to have taken possession of him. Indeed, the words Peter chose appeared to be having a calming effect on the lad- his fingers untwisted themselves, and he resumed biting his thumb for a while before finally allowing his hands to fall quiet in his lap. \"Perhaps that was it.\" James said in a low vice. \"I think it's the traces of the seminary still in me- they don't even acknowledge sexuality outside of marriage, let alone entertain thoughts of an alternative to heterosexuality. Admittedly, I'm a little unworldy. It was a shock.\" James gave a small, bitter-sounding snort. \"Somewhat humiliating to have to admit. I just didn't know how to process what you told me. I'm sorry.\" Peter waved away the apology. \"Drink?\" He now felt able to offer. James let out a deep sigh. \"Oh, please.\"As he was pouring out a measure of Scotch, he asked, \"Do they really not talk about this at the seminary? Sex, I mean. I would've thought that they'd have to bring it up, particularly with novices.\"James swigged from his glass, clearly not wanting to answer Peter's question. He shrugged and made a face. \"That wasn't really the worst part. The worst part was, that at times, being in that strange little world seemed more suited to me than the so-called real world. I suppose that is in me, the tendency to want to find quietness in books and meditation. I think it made me want to be a police officer, in spite of myself. To force myself to deal with the realities of daily life as it is lived instead of devoting myself to pure scholarship. It's harder, but better to make a connection between religion and the people and the world it applies to.\" The lad was at least willing to engage with reality, as he so termed it, even though he seemed to be oblivious to the fact that he was not living this dictate out when it came to his personal life. Peter didn't push it. He raised his glass slightly to James. \"I think that's a fine motivation. Better than most.\" A smile flickered on James' face, tentatively. Dark was beginning to settle, the room about them falling into a slight murkiness, an absence of light not yet covered by definite darkness. Peter made no move to turn on the main light but instead flicked on a lamp next to him, creating a warm pool of light. \"If you'd like,\" James began. \"could you tell me about Morse? I mean, you and Morse.\" Peter nodded, indicated to him to refill their glasses and went out of the room briefly. He returned with a small wooden box and sat beside James. He began telling him about how he'd walked in on Morse singing some opera-nonsense or other to himself and how this, oddly, had signaled their growing closer and how it had culminated in their first kiss on the White Horse. As he ran out of words, unable to tell James more about Morse without being forced to talk about Blenheim Vale and Deare, Peter opened the box and handed his nephew photos, the few he had held onto over the decades. There was Sergeant Jakes, black and white particularly suited to his features and style; there was Morse, a picture kept from a newspaper clipping, eyes wide open, lacking their vibrant blue (Morse's was a face more suited to colour photos), hair and shirt equally rumpled, his figure slight but the mouth determined. Other faces appeared too- there was Joanie, and Christ, did it hurt to see her sparky smile looking up at him. His sister before she'd married. His own wife, in her nurse's uniform, his daughters. James gazed at each photo handed to him and smiled at the stories his uncle told him. He gathered up the little pictures and carefully put them away again. \"Ach, sometimes it's bloody hard to see face of people who aren't around anymore.\"Night had nearly fully crept in and James prepared to leave. As he was shrugging into his coat, Peter wondered if the evening had been good or bad. Certainly, they'd cleared the air and talked a lot but what did that mean? It had no value if James was simply going to return to Oxford and continue doing precisely whatever he had been doing to himself before. It couldn't go on indefinitely, Peter was sharply aware of that. The best he could do was to be there when that day came. He didn't believe himself that he could do anything to prevent it from happening. A memory seared through him of attempting to stand up and follow Morse out of the pub, only for his legs to give way under him, the alcohol and the past unraveling the iron-hold he had had over himself. Just before James was fully out the door, Peter called his name. \"You know it can't go on like this always. You can't keep it at bay forever.\" James stood in the doorway, hand on the latch. \"I function.\" \"Yeah, and you'll function right up until the moment when you don't anymore.\"\"Well, that's what I intend to do.\"\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\nIn his university days, James had once read a definition of \"dirt\" and this definition had shadowed him from the moment he'd seen Will McEwan's body in the church, and remained with him as he was confined to his hospital bed. Dirt was nothing more than something out of place. Dirt was something which was present where it shouldn't be. Will's body shouldn't have been lying like that in the church. Blood on the altar. There should have been no beauty left in his features, the ugliness and wrongness of his death should've stolen that away. James had experienced an involuntary reminder of the attraction Will had held for him. Running from the church had been the result of the reawakening in him of a hard-trained reaction- to not look. He had never allowed himself to turn his gaze upon Will once he realised he took pleasure in his appearance. When Will had come to him for advice he was not even able to make himself raise his eyes to meet his. Perhaps if he had done so, in spite of his own weakness, he would've perceived the depth of pain in the other man and wouldn't have given him the answer that he had. He couldn't look at Will lying there in the church, too aware that he could not return this intrusive gaze. James himself chafed at being subjected to the eyes of others. This had been his last act of respect to Will. Or cowardice. Both? His head was groggy, a vast swirling grey landscape which he held no control over. It was as if the fire and explosion had not just licked at his body but had also seared through his mind, crumbling doors into ash, charring the ground and allowing the underneath to be exposed. His dreams had grown monstrous, made harsher by the antiseptic surroundings of the hospital. Images of Will- young, then dead, dead, then young, were spliced in with scenes from a summer day, seated at a piano, somehow seguing into the softness of Zoe's caresses, who somehow became Will once again. He awoke, nauseous and with an insistent swelling between his legs which drove him so close to the act of finding some sharp implement and attacking this part of himself. It was alien to him, a piece of him that he tried to ignore but acted apart from him, like an awful creature swelling with angry breaths. He had to get out of this place; he was constantly on view, and apparently, all these doctors and nurses had a right to do this to him. One of his greatest fears was to be committed to a mental asylum, prison or anywhere others were permitted to handle him on the orders of others. In spite of too often not understanding his body or being unable to find any connection between it and the self he vaguely imagined himself to be, he experienced the heaviness of knowing how reliant he was upon it. He needed it to be capable of moving, running, being independent. On sleepless nights- and there had been many of those- impossible choices ran through his mind, a constant one he always gnawed at was this particular conundrum: would he rather lose all his mental capacity and remain physically able or would he choose to be fully physically incapacitated but still in possession of his mental faculties? His inability to make a definitive choice, betraying his dependency on this flawed mortal shell, frustrated him. His exposure seemed total and continuous. The hospital gowns were simply degrading and ridiculous. In spite of all the folds of material they hardly covered anything. Waking up in the hospital, having lost time, unsure of exactly how he had ended up where he was, he knew that someone else must have removed his clothes, tended to his injuries and then dressed him again. This meant someone had examined his skin, checking for any damage done by the fire and instead, had found evidence of older wounds, a mixture of faded white lines and raised pink slits, neatly made- even in an act such as this, James was nothing if not methodical. He'd had enough presence of mind to keep his arms hidden from Lewis when he'd come to visit him. Unfortunately, he still hadn't recovered sufficient control over himself to do the same when his uncle had come to visit him. Though he had said nothing, James knew that Peter had not let those marks escape his notice. In a way, this worried him more- Peter had the tendency to store information and to use it at a time when it was to the best of its advantage. Lewis was the opposite of that- acting in the moment, ruled by his compassion, and also his temper. That had been the first time he'd truly experienced this side of his DI. James knew that their relationship, working or otherwise, had been permanently altered by how he had acted. It had come to him with a queasy jolt during the darkest hour, when even the hospital was quieter than his own mind- he had hurt Lewis. Having considered James his equal, and imagining them to be friends, he felt that this had been exposed as a lie. Distance had sprung up between them since that night and Lewis was too kind (and perhaps even a touch too proud) to press his Sergeant about what in the bloody hell had happened. They would pretend- Lewis would even believe himself that he'd forgiven James and that they were as they had been before. And the one thing he was unable to offer Lewis was a proper explanation. For the first time in years beyond number it hurt to know that someone had taken a step away from him. A year ago he hadn't known Lewis. Now he had to somehow patch up over the deceptions that had been partially revealed and left fully unexplained. Still, he was glad Lewis hadn't been the one to see his bare arms, and that if it had to be someone that it was his uncle. This was not to say he felt himself closer to Peter. Rather, his acceptance of Peter's presence in his life unsettled him. They were too alike in some ways and he was certain that this accounted for the affinity which had strangely grown between them. If Peter hadn't been related to him he couldn't imagine having much to do with him. Life would've been very different indeed if Peter had been his DI and Lewis his uncle. No. He could not allow such silly conjectures to run riot in his head. Never did anyone any good. Also, it was unfair to Peter- it wasn't as if he'd asked to have a nephew like him. Peter's presence, however, had not been unwelcome. Waking up to see his uncle standing with his back to the window, hair and attire immaculate as ever, playing with a lighter, indicated to James more than any doctor's report that no drastic or permanent damage had been done to him.\nHe just needed to get out of this place and be on his own in his flat, only until he had sorted out the broken film of his mind. Right now, in his present condition, it was just to dangerous to be around others. ------------------------------------------------------------------When Peter turned up outside his flat a week after James had been discharged from hospital, they were both a little surprised- James because he had not been expecting Peter to make the trip down again so soon, and Peter because James had on highlighter coloured gloves. \"Spring-cleaning.\" He offered by way of an explanation. \"It's not spring.\" Peter arched an eyebrow at him. \"Well, not all of us can afford hired help.\" He couldn't explain to his uncle that he had been engaged repeatedly, daily, in such tasks. Coming back to his apartment had not helped as much as he'd believed it would in wrestling his thoughts back under control. It was as if a glass full of water had shattered and not only had he to put the receptacle back together, but he also had to preserve the water and contain it somehow. Failing to place a muzzle on his thoughts, he sought another alternative and this was to empty his mind, by directing all his energies towards meaningless tasks. If he could somehow rid himself of these unwanted intrusions, he would then be able to regain his usual strength in screening what he allowed to take up space in his mind. This aim had yet to be accomplished- so far he had reached a state of blankness induced by exhaustion. Work helped as well. Wine too, but only in large amounts. \"Brought you a book, was thinking you might want something.\" Peter handed him the telltale bag from Blackwells. James reached inside- William Golding's \"To The Ends of the Earth\" trilogy. \"Any particular reason you got me this?\"\"No. Morse liked it, that's all I know. And it's long. Why? Should I not have?\"\"No, no, never mind. Thank you.\" Of course, Peter didn't know. He wasn't trying to say anything with the book. He already felt on the back foot and it was nothing his uncle had done, rather his mind in wanting to defend itself had turned on itself instead, like a snake gnawing on its own tail. \"What brings you to Oxford? Surely not just the bookshops?\" James glanced at his watch as he said this- was it too early in the day to offer Peter a drink? He had a need for one himself but would only partake if the other man did too. \"Coffee?\" He offered. \"Please.\" Peter sank into a chair, lighting up a cigarette. As James prepared the coffee, he attempted to map out what Peter was potentially going to say and ask, and what steps he could take in order to take control of the direction of the conversation. The more salacious details of the case were still all over the papers, of course, and they'd had a field day over a Sergeant being involved in it all. It'd been so long since they'd seen one another, not counting the hospital visit. Ever since their last proper talk he had avoided meeting his uncle, unnerved by his parting sentence to him, and even more so in realising how much he had meant the response he had given to his uncle. Only after he had fixed Peter's coffee with plenty of milk and sugar (James winced at this display as he set his own unadulterated black coffee beside it), only then did Peter begin:\"So, you've decided to give no thought to your career at all then?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"What do I mean? I'm amazed your DI Lewis hasn't chewed you out several times over for this already. The way you handled everything in this case, James. Look, I have no interest in interfering in your private life, that is not my affair. But bloody hell lad, when I see you trampling over your career so recklessly I have to say something. This can't go on. Personal and professional lives have to be kept separate. To do that you have to be in control of yourself and you are not in control of anything right now, least of all yourself. Sort it out, James, just sort it out either way.\" James tightened his grip on the coffee mug so that a light burning sensation ran along his palm. In working on purging unwelcome thoughts from his own mind he had been unable to totally avoid the knowledge that those around him were not following a like course of action. The whispers had got louder and he was aware he had become a figure of mockery to most. For some, he was even a figure to be reviled. If Innocent and Lewis hadn't made such a public show of their continued faith in him, he knew his situation would be a lot worse. However, as it was, it was barely contained. \"Lewis and Innocent have not changed their opinion of me, in a professional capacity.\" He replied. \"As for the rest, well, that's just gossip. As long as others will work with me, I don't ask for anything more.\"Peter exhaled, his frustration apparent. \"Well, it is at least something that you've your superior's confidence. But are you sure this is how you want your life in the work place? To be a figure who is merely tolerated because he's good at his job?\" James smiled tiredly. \"Did you know there are white starlings occasionally?\" \"You what?\" Peter was in the process of lighting another cigarette. \"You mean those dark speckled birds that make a huge racket and hang about in droves?\"\"That's them, yes. Do you know what they do to those albino starlings? They attack them, chase them, drive them to the edge of the group. They have to learn other ways of surviving without the group. Sometimes I feel humanity as a whole hasn't progressed much beyond such animal behaviour. That's why the comments of the PCs don't bother me. It's always been like this. And why should I care about the twitterings of a flock of birds?\"\"Well, that's noble and all James, but would it hurt for the white starling to dye its feathers dark every so often just so they can get ahead?\"He didn't answer his uncle, the words sticking in his throat- even if he did dye his feathers, they'd still know. He was marked and that was just how things were.\nThere was a pause before Peter said: \"You went to the funeral.\" James nodded. \"How was it?\" \n\nTo put off answering, James brought the mug to his lips. The bitter liquid sat uneasily in his empty stomach. \"It was too hard.\" He said quietly. \"I sat there and I couldn't stop remembering Will as I last saw him, his body...and though the prayers have meaning for me, I couldn't forget about how it made Will feel. It was just too much.\" \"What happened James? Nothing I've heard makes much sense.\"James shook his head repeatedly, miserably; he was not saying no to Peter's question but to the sensations it had awakened. \"Can't you just read about it in the papers or get the gossip from your former cronies down the station?\" \"No. I want to hear from you what really went on. Because from the outside it looks incomprehensible.\"\"Not much different on the inside, I'm afraid.\"\"Try me.\"\"When...when did you first know,\" James slowly formed his question. \"about who you were attracted to?\" \"Do you mean just in general or are you asking specifically after one gender here?\"\"Both?\"Peter took a long drag on his cigarette, looking off at a spot somewhere over James' shoulder. \"Surprising though it may seem, I was a bit of a late starter in that area. Places where I was weren't conducive to teenage crushes or first kisses. It was really only once I got out, so I suppose we're talking seventeen, eighteen. It was also something no-one ever talked to us about, you have to keep that in mind. Things are different nowadays, I imagine, sex-ed and all that. But for me, it all started in the cinema, which was quite nice really, sitting in the dark, able to look at the screen without worrying about others catching you out, no need for you to form a response. That was when I first experienced- not attraction but more a physical reaction. I'd found people attractive before but this was the first time I'd properly linked attraction to desire, a want for contact. It was my affair, private, secret. It didn't bother me I suppose because I didn't tell anyone, couldn't. Found clubs to go to in London, and well...\" He seemed to want to continue, to say more on the subject. He instead lit another cigarette, falling silent. He turned his gaze on James briefly, indicating that he was expecting some sort of response or at least something which would continue their conversation. He envied his uncle for being able to stare his desires in the face and simply take care of them, not needing to let his privacy be compromised. There were countless questions welling up in him, begging to be given voice to. How did you know that what you felt wouldn't turn out to be uncontrollable in the act? How do you tell the person you're with what you don't like doing? How do you separate a sensation felt in the moment from a memory of a sensation felt at another time? Can you want to touch someone romantically but not sexually? What's wrong with me? James kept his mouth firmly shut, biting fiercely down on his bottom lip, the pain helping him to reign himself back in. He was always anxious that one day his thoughts would just spill out of him involuntarily. He knew however, that Peter was expecting some kind of admission similar to that one he had just made. \"Well.\" James' lip twitched at how this would sound to his uncle. \"To be completely honest, for me, it was a scene in the bible.\"Peter cocked an eyebrow at him. \"Oh, I am being entirely serious.\" James assured him. \"Of course you are. Of course you did.\" The look of mild amusement on his face allowed James for the first time to view this event from his adolescence with any sort of objectivity. Perhaps it was kind of funny, the idea of this boy getting hot and bothered by the bible. \"Certain amount of irony, I suppose.\" Though not quite able to laugh at his younger self, he at least had a new-found sense of indulgence for that strange boy. \"You know the story of David and Goliath?\" Peter nodded, still smiling faintly around his cigarette. \"There were some rather unexpected passages about him and Jonathan, son of King Saul. Jonathan talks about how his soul is knit with the soul of David, and how he loves David as his own soul. David and Jonathan found their love passing that of woman.\"James could still remember stumbling on those words, stopping and rereading them, panicking someone would hear his quickened breath or would look over his shoulder and see the burning words he was reading. \"I was excited. I didn't have the vocabulary to explain even to myself just what that meant. What exactly were David and Jonathan getting up to? The bible is a bit hazy on that. It fired my imagination however. I was fixated on the idea of these two men and the strength of their attachment.\"He left out certain aspects of this discovery. How he had been so frightened by this involuntary assault of feeling and sensation, how out of control he felt himself to be. The bible for a period, usually his refuge, failed him, instead bringing with it that which he sought every day to hide and forget. The fixation- obsession- in spite of himself scared him too. This did not fit the idea of himself he had created. If he could get this preoccupied by something he could not tame or contain, who knew where it would end? His nights back then became a torment, filled with sickly dreams, seductive and suffocating. He'd somehow adjusted to it, not telling anyone, working hard, slowly returning to prayer. It became a dull ache, instead of an active jammering. It was the aftermath of a blow, a bruise which he hoped would fade. Perhaps it would've if it could've remained understood in reference to David and Jonathan. But this unfortunately had not been the case.\nJames shifted in his seat, wanting to close his eyes against the image which came to mind. But he knew, for all that his uncle was decent and not at all malicious, he knew he would seize upon such a gesture. Also, it was completely illogical, foolish even, to believe that closing his eyes would in any way blank out the picture of Will McEwan. He swallowed before speaking, not wanting to stutter or trip up on the name as he pronounced it. \"I met Will then, Will McEwan.\"There were things he would never tell his uncle- not because he distrusted him or because he was ashamed. No. Certain memories he had of his friendship with Will were for him and him alone. They were now the one thing left to him after this case. They were altogether too precious to be handed over to someone else. \"Will was my first proper friend, I suppose you could say. You can imagine that I wasn't exactly the most popular boy in school.\" Will had been the first person he had met who had actively sought out his company. He didn't think he was odd or a know-it-all. Rather, he always wanted to hear the things James told him, and would give him his full attention. It had always been like that between them- James would tell him things, Will would show him things, would drag him off 'exploring' somewhere. He bit down harder on his lip, finally, the tang of blood came horribly sharp on his tongue. Yes, even when they were supposedly grown up James was still the one telling Will things, as if he had any authority to be giving Will advice. And poor Will, so used to the pattern of their old friendship had come to him to hear what James could tell him. \"He was just...\" James faltered, running his fingertips over his lips, wiping away any stray blood. \"I liked looking at him, I wanted to look at him, but I couldn't.\"\"Why not?\" \"It's not fair to look at another person like that. I mean, Will could've not wanted to be looked at like that.\"\"He could've- but he did? By you? Did he look at you the same way?\"\"He came to me, and told me that he was gay. And I laughed in his face.\"James had hunched his shoulders and could only enunciate these words to the bare wooden floor. \"I thought it was a trap, to lure me.\"\"A trap? How so?\" \"I don't know exactly. I just instantly had the sense of being under attack, as if this was a test and that there were eyes upon us. So instead of giving him any proper answer, such as yes or no, or I like you too, I laughed.\"\"Sometimes,\" Peter had shifted forward and James knew he was attempting to catch his eye. He refused to look up as his uncle continued. \"Sometimes, when we're offered the thing we want most, we get scared, and retreat, a misplaced act of self-defence. Wanting something, and showing that you want it, makes you vulnerable.\"\"And by doing that, I hurt him. I affected his life in the worst way possible. I can't ever make it better, I can't right that wrong.\"\"No. But you can salvage something from the situation by making things better for yourself.\"James gave a mirthless laugh. \"I can never make that better either. I just have to live with it.\"Living with it was what he said to Peter. However, he sometimes believed he had died a long time ago.\n", "7": "\nChapter Text\nAfter all this time, the cases which remained with Peter were the ones which had had young children as their victims. There had been many cases over the years, and too many murders; yet, certain images of a small body clad in white, her limbs in an unnatural heap, or the moment of opening a coffin and expecting to find a young girl dead inside it- these were the pictures which never faded, never lost their unforgiving sharp focus. He didn't even remember his dreams the way he remembered these particular cases. Dreams and their contents had always dissolved immediately upon waking. Certainly, he had dreams. However, he no longer woke up on the floor as he used to on occasion, and it was a long time indeed since someone had slept beside him, so there was no one to shake him out of the visions that had a grip on him. Now and then he jerked out of slumber, sweating, choking, and knew he'd been dreaming. Of what, he could not recall, but he knew anyway.Going by his appearance, James had dreams too, but was not granted the mercy of remaining ignorant of their contents. That was, if the lad was sleeping properly at all. Peter didn't want James' face to join that gallery, the gallery of those children he couldn't help. Yes, James was a grown man, however he couldn't stop himself from seeing only a boy in front of him. The figure which had lain huddled under the thin hospital bed sheets had appeared absurdly young to him. Sitting across from his nephew, he had been unable to smoke, waiting for him to come to, his mind churning away, his thinking clear and almost clinical in its assessments. Well, someone had to be in this situation, otherwise he wouldn't be much help to James. Too many questions had been thrown up by the Will McEwan case and Peter was certain that the repercussions had not even fully yet begun. The night he'd received a call from the hospital, informing him of his nephew's condition. During the drive to Oxford he'd been preoccupied with the newly learnt information that, no, James Hathaway did no have his mother or father listed as his next-of-kin, but rather one Peter Jakes. He had a need to validate this gesture of trust, but at the same time, remained aware that any overt reference to it would cause James to retreat even further. The lad was always at war with himself, wanting so much and unable to accept anything. The scars had been alarming. Peter couldn't even pretend to comprehend such a habit. (For it was clearly a habit and a long-standing one at that.) The idea of turning on yourself and attacking your body was disgusting, if he was completely honest with himself. He did not mean that his nephew disgusted him- the action did. However, he felt himself unable to broach the topic with James. The lad had not chosen to share this information with him. He had only seen the evidence of this activity in a moment when James had been unconscious, unable to defend himself. He had seen it without James' permission. It was too easy to predict how he would react if his uncle sought to talk to him about it. When he and Morse had slept together for the first time, Peter had lain beside him in the narrow bed, and on feeling Morse's hands stroking down his back, he had tensed, knowing the other man could see the pink and white scars from the vicious caning Deare had subjected him to. In spite of Morse's kind reaction (or because of it), Peter had been nearly overwhelmed by a wave of conflicting sensations. And for James, who was such a stranger to his own body in a way Peter had never suffered from, reference to these scars, no matter how well-intended, would likely pitch him further into the crisis he seemed unable to free himself from. \u00a0--------------------------------------------------------------------------Late night phone calls were something Peter had come to dread in recent years. Earlier in his life, in his career, if the phone rang after midnight it usually turned out to be an emergency call-out, or a drunken lover (ex-, or otherwise) who had decided to contact him. Mild annoyances really, in the grand scheme of things. Now though, the shrill tones of a phone shattering his silent surroundings caused him to brace himself for the worst before he picked up the receiver or pressed the answer button on his mobile. Such calls had informed him of his mum's passing, Max's death, then Joanie. These days, his first thought was for his daughters, and his sister. There was no one else left. The past couple of years however, he had begun to expect a late night phone call telling him of something which had happened to his nephew. He could still recall his confusion as he'd reached for the phone, and how he'd tried to understand sentences about James being in hospital, explosions, burns, drugs. His mobile rang incessantly tonight, vibrating furiously at the same time. Peter eyed it blearily, experiencing an irrational desire to chuck the thing out the window. Instead, he picked it up and put it to his ear. It was no use trying to run away from such demands and claims. \"Hello?\" He grumbled into the phone. There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end, followed by a muttered curse.\"...James?\" \"Yes, unfortunately. Look, I apologize, I just saw what time it is and I realise I shouldn't have called. I hope I didn't disturb you too much.\"\"No, James, James, you've woken me up now, c'mon, stay a bit. Is there anything-\" Peter wanted to avoid the phrasing \"wrong\", knowing James would flinch from it. \"...eh, anything happening?\" \"Just a case.\" James fell silent, clearly struggling for words. Peter didn't press him, instead saying, \"Here, give us a chance to get a cigarette lit and then I'll be able to listen.\" As he shook out a cigarette and lit it up, he listened to the irregular breathing on the other end of the line. Needed some time to gather his thoughts, he supposed. Small talk wouldn't be any help. Both he and James had little time for such prattle- although he suspected that even when pressed to supply bits of idle chat if necessary his nephew still wouldn't be much good at it. Peter, on the other hand, was well able to talk meaningless shite with the best of them, when it was needed. It was a skill he learnt as he made his way up the ranks. He was able to do it; he just disliked it. His and James' relationship had never really allowed for much bullshitting. Anytime they talked there was a purpose, whether it was external circumstances or an issue which eventually ended up remaining unacknowledged. But it was there, palpably so, underpinning their every word. Peter couldn't decide whether such a phone call meant James was attempting to create further distance between them or whether it implied the opposite. Perhaps he found it easier to talk on the phone. Having your ear pressed up against this object, unable to see the person you're conversing with- could be that it was not unlike confession for James. Peter exhaled, and as he reached over for an ashtray on his bedside table, he heard the noise of liquid being poured into a glass. He wondered how much James had had to drink already- and, indeed, if his consumption had increased in recent months. Something had altered in him since the Will McEwan and Feardorcha case. \"I have to give evidence in a trial. I found the body.\" James was using his overly even and dead straight voice. Not to mask any drunkenness. This was the tone he used, Peter had come to recognise, when he was worried his emotions would get the better of him and would prevent him from speaking and making himself understood. It was always so vitally important to the lad to express himself in the precisely correct manner he favoured. It had been a couple of years since his and James' first proper talk, sitting outside The Trout, and in spite of themselves, they had come to know each other well. \"Which case?\" He listened as James hastily swallowed from his drink. Whiskey or wine, Peter wondered. \"The Zelinsky case.\" \"I read about that in the paper. Well, to be completely honest, forced myself to read it.\" \"Peter, how did you deal with cases like this? With children? She was only a child, she was so tiny, so light, it was like trying to hold together an egg with a crack running through it. And I have to get up and somehow give cold hard evidence about this. I don't think even God can give me enough strength for this.\"\"You found her, you said?\"\"Yes, and it was all wrong, everything was wrong, her bones were just...\" He broke off; another swig. \"James, listen to me. What you're feeling right now, the horror, the anger, disgust, all of that- that's what makes you a good detective. It won't help much in your career, to be honest with you, but it stands to you in other ways. You can make a choice. You can hold onto that feeling and keep it with you for other cases like this, and there will be other cases like this, prepare yourself for that right now. Or you can stop it, turn it off. Ignore the bullshit people say about it, you can will yourself to turn off your feelings about this. View them as you would any other case you deal with.\"\"You can't, you can't just flick a switch and stifle reactions like that. It's not human.\" \"It's very human. You can get used to anything. That's our strength, and our biggest problem, as human beings. The cases involving children were the ones that always fucked me up James, would take me days to recover, particularly back when I was a Sergeant. I learnt somehow to cut off those feelings you're having at the moment. Made me a worse detective, worse person too probably, but a better officer if you get me. I got promoted, and promoted again and eventually I was in a position on the force where I didn't have much contact with cases anymore, directly. Victims became an abstract.\"\"That's...that's horrific.\" James said hoarsely. \"No, it was self-preservation. I think you understand that all too well. And there's always something ugly about it, about survival. It warps you. You'll be surprised at what you become capable of doing just to get through.\" Peter turned his head, gazing at the drawn curtains and the muted, artificial light from the street invading his bedroom. \"But don't think for a moment that I haven't been disappointed with myself for the choice I made. But I made it, and I have to live with it. Morse was like you, and he kept that sense of...\" Peter faltered for a moment. Why was he telling James all this? Perhaps because when it came down to it, this would be the only advice he would ever give him directly, would ever dare to give him. \"Morse placed demands on those around him, on the world at large, to reach certain standards, and demanded for them to be held accountable when they didn't. You have something similar.\" \"And according to you it's a bit of a handicap for getting on.\" \"Depends on what you see getting on as. I can't seriously imagine you want a position like mine, Chief Superintendent.\"\"Not really, no. But then why did you want it so badly?\"\"Because I wanted to be in a powerful position. That's always come first. Secondly, better for me to have the position than fuck knows who. You've been on the force for a few years now, James. You must've encountered some of the specimens who choose this as their career. I don't do much to help- I'm not that deluded behind my paperwork, but I'm at least a neutral, fair presence, and that's an improvement on what's been there before.\"\"You mean corruption.\"\"That too, and worse. Much worse.\" Peter smoothed his free hand over his hair, tamping it down. His fingers closed around his cigarette packet, the familiar shape and feel of the paper and foil, the rounded tips of the cigarettes themselves grounding him. \"Have you ever heard of Blenheim Vale?\" Even after all this time, those words were tough to pronounce. He never shortened the name, even in his head. He was compelled to this, convinced that leaving out any syllable would be to make light of all that it represented to him and the others who had been there. \"No. What is it?\"\"\"Was a home for wayward boys. Ostensibly held up as a great charity bestowed on those less fortunate. The reality was that it was an old boy's club, and they had the power of a very high up officer indeed behind them. Could make any story disappear, make any child disappear that was a potential threat. It was their playground. There were so many cover-ups.\"\"Did you work on this case?\" Peter gave a mirthless bark of laughter. \"I was there as a kid. Wasn't there for a long time but I swapped one institution for another until I was old enough to leave. But while I was in Blenheim Vale I got the full impact of having to be a pawn in their games.\" The remembered sensation of their interrogation crashed over him. \"What do you mean?\" James' voice had taken on a confused edge, higher, tense. \"They used me. I was their plaything, when they felt like it. They liked young kids, you see, and being in charge of a boy's school, where most of us were orphans or just abandoned, or even petty criminals, there were no families for us to run and tell tales to.\"\nPeter looked down at his cigarette and noted how it had burned itself down to mostly ash, but was still holding itself together somehow, the bright red glow visible underneath, and all too close to his knuckles. He gave that one up, allowing it to crumble into a grey pile in the ashtray, and set about lighting up a new one as he waited for James to respond. What he was expecting from his nephew, he didn't know. Something, anything. He was quite aware that he was goading James, pressing him, and that he was doing this because of the knowledge that he would not react unless backed into a corner. Otherwise they would continue to do this dance, James cracking at irregular intervals, managing to patch himself up enough to appear fine and continue on, only for the damage to run deeper and deeper. Ever since Will McEwan's suicide it was as if the lad was drifting further away, constructing a place not to be reached by anyone, where only his own logic ruled. The Garden and Feardorcha had threatened James' defences in a way that even his crisis of faith hadn't managed to shake. It was likely that precisely because of his renewed faith that everything had become more incomprehensible. Peter was sure that no matter what, James would've developed a powerful attachment to religion; it was just part of what made him who he was. It would be crass and insulting to suggest that the boy had only turned to it as a result of what may or may not have happened in his life. A few years back, however, James could've blamed any uncertainties, or even fears he was having, on the fact that he had lost his faith, temporary though it may have been. Would've been easy to claim that losing your major orientation in life had left you a bit unsure, even frightened. Having to confront Will McEwan, and now Zelinsky, with his God firmly reinstated meant he would be forced to go deeper to find an explanation or understanding as to just what in these cases seemed to threaten the fabric of his being. \"But...\" James began. \"You don't look like it.\"\"I don't look like what?\" Peter left the word unsaid. Victim. No, he fucking did not look like a victim and he never had. What did a victim look like? Scarcely would he even allow himself to think of the word in reference to himself. You either got on, or you died, whether by your own hand, or by enacting a living death through the mouth of a dummy. If you didn't get on with it, it would catch up on you, and swallow you whole. He knew he'd sound a right bastard if he were to ever say any of this out loud, and he knew that yes, there were those who needed these words, this survivor talk, that it helped them to some degree to put the past behind them. He also knew that some others were just not capable of continuing on. Thinking about that always made him twitchy. What was the difference then between him and those who had crumpled, those who had been left not able to function? Why had he managed to scrape through and others hadn't? This placed him so close to them, and it terrified him, the idea that only a thin, thin line had separated him from a similar fate. Being around children was hard for him due to this. He didn't hate them, or have too little time for them. Yet even with his own two daughters, it had only been when they reached their teenage years that he could first allow himself to engage with them. Work had been a good excuse to fall back on, and he simply made sure he wasn't present too much. Being around children, small children, was unbearable- he was so scared for them, and couldn't communicate this to them, much less the reason why he was gripped by this fear. He would see children- at home, brought into the station, messing about on the street- and he wanted to be harsh to them, to teach them not to trust those in power unquestioningly, to learn to rely on themselves. If only someone had done that for him- he had had to learn the hard way.\nChildren made him remember Little Pete, and this brought home in the most awful, visceral way the true nature of what had been done to him in Blenheim Vale. To see how tiny a ten year old was, how skinny and breakable, a mere ragdoll, how open and trusting, to see this was to understand that he had been this same figure, he too had been this child. It turned his stomach when he thought about these children he saw around him being subjected to the same fate as him. Only recently had something even worse developed. He would look at his nephew, and in him, he had to recognise what he had been at that age, how close to being that he had come. To look at James was to bear witness to how that child survived to adulthood. It was to see how a strange contradiction was painfully held in one person- in James, this childhood self was fiercely, fiercely denied but simultaneously was all too evident. Yes, tonight's phone call had only confirmed what Peter could no longer allow himself to doubt, or to dismiss as his own imagination over-reacting. Who had it been? The most obvious choice in James' case was a member of the church, or even another member of the congregation. Someone from the estate he'd lived on for a few years? A teacher? A family member? It had to be considered, for it was a possibility. A random attack? He hadn't the faintest idea. One thing he was certain of- he couldn't help James. He would always be ready to listen to the lad and try and do his best to intervene. How could he attempt to help James beyond that, he who could so little help himself? Sure, he'd got through, climbed the career ladder, had a wife, had two daughters. Yet he was always faintly aware of a lack within himself. This lack had arisen from his continual denial of what had happened. Disconnection to these events led to him being able to perceive them only as a numbness, a gap. For Christ's sake, his own wife had died without ever having a notion of the secrets he held onto. It was too late for him. Even if he decided to address this issue of his past head-on, it would not work, simply because he had become so detached from Little Pete that he could no longer engage with this part of himself. He supposed that was why he hadn't been hugely unsettled by his suspicions about James, or by those moments when their conversations touched lightly and dangerously on this area. He experienced an odd wistfulness for that younger version of himself, the Sergeant, who ricocheted from boozing himself into oblivion before covering up again. That young man had been passionate, fiery. All too often these days he was just tired. Seeking to refocus on James, he pressed the phone against his ear, listening to the laboured breathing on the other end. The lad was struggling with something, but what? He began to speak, his voice barely under control, thick with unshed tears. \"I meant to say- you can tell by looking. You can tell that there's something wrong with them because otherwise it wouldn't have happened to them. And you don't look in anyway wrong.\"\"Doesn't work like that, James. Can happen to anyone. Believe me, I still have a hard time with that idea.\"Henry, Angela, Nicholas, George, Benny, Big Pete, Little Pete- could you tell by looking at them, by a group photo, in black and white? \"James. Take me as your terrible warning. You really don't want to end up like me. Find some way of battling this.\"\"I can't. I can't tell anyone ever. It's too much. I don't want anyone to know.\"\"Doesn't have to be today or tomorrow. But sometimes, before it's too late, before you're as old as I am, tell someone. There's always one person, somewhere, an unlikely one but stronger than you think. And they'll listen, they'll be able to help more than I can.\"\"Not right now. I need to get through this Zelinsky case. After that, I'll see.\" He paused before asking, in a near whisper. \"Did you tell mum about this or-?\"\"Not a word. About me, or about you. Never will. It's your business.\"\"I'm sorry.\"\"What are you apologising for James?\"\"I don't know. For not being just your average nephew? For burdening you with this? For what happened to you. For reminding you.\"\"None of that, I'll have none of that. Don't apologise. Just get through this. Don't let it ruin you.\" When he hung up the phone, the silence engulfed the flat once more. Out of this silence emerged the memory of large blue eyes gazing at him in shock and sympathy, outrage and camaraderie. Morse always did have the most expressive eyes, capable of running the gamut of emotions in a split second. It was in the anger on his behalf that Peter had found support. If he had instead seen pity reflected there, he probably would've hit Morse. That attempt to give him back some power, some agency, giving him a chance to confront Deare, it had just been too much. He hardly ever allowed himself to imagine what ifs, but tonight he did. What if he and Morse had met when he was younger? Would he have been a different man? Would he have stayed longer in Oxford, would he have stayed longer with Morse? A soft snort escaped him. He was forgetting that Morse had had his own demons, memories which stained and shaped his life, and from which he'd never freed himself. The way things had happened between them had been imperfect, to say the least. But those remembered sensations continued to hit him with the force of a sun beam angling through drawn shades. He didn't try to kid himself- in his current state, James wasn't even able for a coming together such as he and Morse had somehow sustained. The lad would probably never recover entirely. But there had to be a better way to live, there had to be hope for alleviating his all too apparent ongoing suffering.\nPeter carefully put the nearly overflowing ashtray on his bedside table, and rolled over on his side, seeking sleep. He hoped that James would find some rest tonight too.\n", "8": "\nChapter Text\nJames stood at the bar, hoping that the combination of too much alcohol and overly-loud dance music would help deaden him not only to his unsavoury surroundings but also to what was in his own head. He had yet to find a method of permanently silencing the unwanted noise within him; yet, the past few years- and in particular, the past few months- had demonstrated to him that copious amounts of alcohol ingested in an indiscriminate manner lent him the distance from his own self that he craved. The cost of this, however, was having to relinquish full control over his body, his memory and his ability to analyze. The pain which followed the morning after was of little consequence to him. Rather, he welcomed it, as it served to forcibly sharpen him, narrowing his world down to the throbbing in his head and the work in front of him.\nThe dance music helped as it was so utterly obnoxious and attention-seeking that each juddering beat made it extremely difficult for him to form complex thoughts. Sometimes the cacophony of the night club was a greater refuge for him than the cloistered stillness of the church. Tonight was such a night. He had already lost count of the drinks he'd consumed, as he had lost count of days passing. This inability to measure time had begun to occur since Crevecoeur had come back into his life. The case was officially over and yet, time seemed to pass as though there was no structure regulating it and James was powerless against this current. He continued to wake and ready himself in time for work, however, everything else ran through his fingers as water. No certainties remained- without warning time would change and he no longer knew whether he was a police officer or a child, whether Lord Mortmaigne was dead or alive, whether it was summer or winter or no time at all. Drink did not clarify any of this for him; it only served to make matters simpler by removing his ability to understand them. With his mind as disengaged and as deadened as was possible, he found himself remaining in this hideous place, watching those around him fumbling unsubtly through some semblance of seduction, aggressively and blatantly grasping each other, their faces as dumb and over-excited as animals. It was too warm, too sticky, he could feel sweat beginning to bead on his body. The smell of this place was too much, it was too close. He wanted to do this to himself though, to rub his face in that which repulsed him. He'd always found other people's scent hard to tolerate. Strong, heavy sweat turned his stomach, always had. He could not remember a time when it had not. He drank again, hoping the alcohol would counter the thick cloud of human excretion hanging in the air. He attempted to look at those around him and judge whether they were attractive to him or not. He wouldn't allow his gaze to follow those men who were older, a good deal older than him, even though they were perhaps the only ones he could even entertain approaching. Never. Never. He sought instead to return the interested glances from younger men, sleek individuals with lizard-like eyes flickering over him, assessing, judging, roving. He drank again. Why did people do this? Why couldn't he do this? He turned his back to them all, supporting himself on the bar instead. If he didn't have to go through the idiotic charade that was taking place on the so-called dance floor he could get through this. He didn't want it- he wanted to want it and wanted to already have it over and done with. He needed to have someone take charge of this, to drag him along like the meaningless current of time did. Invariably, someone came, accepting the challenge of James Hathaway's stony expression, his awkward stance and his silence. He was young and brash, crass almost. James let it wash over him, barely registering the man's moving mouth as anything but another part of the noise around him. When the man indicated that they should remove themselves from this place to somewhere else James simply followed. Easy, easy, easy. He could do this, as easily as Scarlett had done it to him, as Feardorcha had. His body lay limp in the passenger seat, as limp as his mind. He had no desire or need, his only need was to have that same desire that everyone else seemed to take for granted. Even with Feardorcha it had not been desire or attraction which had drawn him in, it was the memory of Will. Unbidden, the memory of Will swam to the surface, the only coherent thought in his booze-addled, exhausted mind. After the fire, even after talking to his uncle, James had resolved not to grieve Will. Allowing himself this would be to give himself permission to eventually forget Will, or to take only pleasure from his memory. Will had come to him for help and advice; James had spoken words which had poisoned his friend's life. It was only right for the memory of Will to hurt, scratching at his skin, little hooks reminding him of how low he could be at heart, little hooks pinching and disfiguring him, anchoring him to his past. Often, he understood Will's image as representing his failure to overcome his own history. God had given him a challenge, a chance at redemption to make both his and Will's life better, and he had been unable to measure up to it. So, Will haunted him, accompanied him, and James sought it out actively, tortured himself with it. Even when they were inside the man's apartment and as he poured out further drinks for them, still James believed he would be able to go through with this. Yet when they made their way towards the bedroom, a dread overcame him, and his stomach roiled. Panic threatened to engulf him. He saw no way out of this situation, a way out that didn't end with him pinned underneath this other man. Instead he managed to gather his thoughts together and went down on his knees, stopping the man's progress to the bed. This he could do, indeed had done times beyond number. It was a way of maintaining some distance whilst giving the other person what they wanted. This allowed for him to remain clothed and keep most of his body away from the unwanted probings and graspings of wandering hands. No opportunity was available for sweat to mingle, or indeed, other bodily fluids. Subjecting himself to potential hair-grabbing (difficult enough to gain a secure hold with his head shorn as closely as it was) or having his head forced too hard and held down were the only drawbacks of this situation. However having initiated this act, the man seemed content to let James continue in taking the lead and simply stood there, happy to be done to. He was good at this, and fought his urge to flee, knowing that the better he performed the quicker this would all be over. A rhythm emerged and the repetitions of these mechanical acts helped James to disengage, to disappear until he was scarcely aware of what he was doing and yet was able to continue doing it. He retreated not to some imagined place, but rather found a non-place where he could simply not be, and where nothing else was, not even God. His mouth hurt, and he desperately wanted to wipe the spit dribbling along his chin but didn't dare to move his hands and instead kept going, pushing himself to maintain his action, promising himself a long, long shower as soon as he could extricate himself from this situation. Come mixed with the saliva and James pressed his fingers to his lips, swallowing it down, holding himself still as the man held onto him for support. He didn't remember how he had got out of the apartment but now he found himself hurrying down the road, trying not to break into a flat out run, for that would certainly attract unwanted attention to him. Sucking in deep breaths through his mouth, seeking to avoid the smell clinging to him, he strode along as if he knew where he was. The address the man had given the taxi driver eluded him and so he kept going, following the road, which eventually led him back to Oxford town. A taxi would have brought him back to his apartment much faster but he couldn't stomach the thought of being in a confined space with a stranger. He wanted to be invisible for a while, to try and scrub this entire evening off of himself somehow. He thought briefly of his uncle and dismissed the idea again instantly. He never wanted anyone to know about this night. In time, hopefully he too would forget it had happened or he'd at least be able to pretend so. ------------------------------------------------------------------Behind his desk, James surreptitiously shook another two paracetamol into his palm and sneaked them into his mouth without Lewis noticing. He likely needn't have bothered with being so careful- the Inspector had his back turned to him, and was poring over a rather thick file. For an average sized office the distance between them seemed cavernous. This gap had opened up in the aftermath of the Feardorcha case and then Crevecoeur had served to widen this breach irreparably, it would seem. They continued to work together, and worked together very well indeed, but Lewis had noticeably retreated from him. Initially it was an extension of his being furious and exasperated with his Sergeant. Yet now, compounded by what had happened with Scarlett and everything else that had been left unsaid and unbroached about that particular case, their relationship had returned to a purely professional one. Only now in its absence did James experience how heavily he relied on his boss's gentle kindness, his affability, and his strength. It was as if the evening sun had gone in. There was no sense in worrying over it- he had done it to himself. Each display of concern or inquiry James had met with silence, blankness, cryptic answers, followed by simply shutting down. He had said good evening and walked away. You reap what you sow. He'd adapted to Lewis' new attitude and sought to meet it appropriately and carry on. Certainly the after effects of his escapade last night was not aiding him in this endeavour. His temples throbbed, the skin spanning his skull feeling as if it were one size too small for him. Focusing on the work at hand was proving to be challenging indeed, as the words scuttled away from him, not revealing their meaning and intent to him. Perhaps if he could have another cigarette, another cup of coffee? Or if he could just walked in solitude and not be so sharply aware of the division between him and his DI. The pain in his head was overwhelming; James put his elbows on his desk and rested his head in his hands, shielding his closed eyes from the daylight. Bloody fool, he mouthed to himself. Can't even do your job well now, or even competently. He pressed his fingertips to the bridge of his nose, seeking somehow to relieve the pressure building behind his eyes. He ached everywhere, deep down in his bones, he ached all over. Thoughts of the previous night's activities came to him, unbidden. Attempting to banish them he tried to light upon something else to fill his mind but once again, any conscious control and choice was wrested from him as Uncle Peter's words came back to him, jumbled in with an incoherent narrative involving Feardorcha, Will, Scarlett, himself. He bit down fiercely on the soft flesh on the inside of his hand, desperately trying to restore himself to the present moment but it had no effect. This pain simply became part of the hurt coursing through his body. He swallowed thickly, fearing he would vomit. Unable to fight against his body anymore, it broke out of his throat, but instead of spewing, a sob escaped his mouth. There was silence for a moment, and he fought in vain once again, his frame shaking violently with the effort. \"James, James lad, what...\"He couldn't move, there was no strength or power in his limbs. Head hanging, keening cries tore through him, he couldn't get enough air, his shoulders heaved, he became increasingly light-headed and he slumped forward, forehead pressed against his paperwork. Dimly aware of his surroundings, he registered movement in the room, he heard a door being closed and locked. He gave himself over fully to this monster, this unholy beast which had seized his body. Now that Lewis had left the room, had left him alone, hopefully he could void this poison from himself and regain some semblance of composure. However, he did not expect to feel someone drawing closer to him, placing solid arms around his shoulders and holding on, gently working against any of James' residual resistance and pulling him closer, holding him to his chest. Lewis said nothing and James was incapable of giving voice to anything except for these inarticulate, seemingly endless cries.Fading away from himself he lost track of time once more, and when he came back to himself he could not tell how long this fit had gone on for. His throat was raw, his eyes swollen and hot but the pain in his head and behind his eyes had been greatly eased.\nLewis kept him in this protective hold and somehow James had folded up his body and he felt a child, with his face pressed into the older man's chest. He couldn't even recall the last time anyone had offered him such simple comfort. Rather, he could but he wished not to think of Feardorcha just now. It was at the same time wildly disconcerting to be in such a position, and James extricated himself from Lewis. He let him go but kept a warm hand on his shoulder. James took a few deep steadying breaths, wondering what on earth to say or even how to proceed after what had just happened. \"Thank you, Sir.\" His voice was scratchy in his throat but under control. \"I also apologise for inflicting that on you.\" \"Ach.\" Lewis made a face, dismissing it. \"Do ye want to take the day off, head home?\"\"No Sir. I'd rather stay here.\"\"Thought as much. I also don't really think your heading home to an empty flat is a great idea.\" He paused, looking at James carefully. \"Is there anything I can do?\"\"No, not at the moment.\" \"Is this anything to do with, well, with-\"James stopped him before he could say the name of the place. \"Yes, it is Sir. I apologise for it effecting my work, and you, as it has.\" Lewis made to speak again but James continued. \"One day, I hope I can tell you about it. I think I'd like to be able to tell you. But I can't just yet.\"\"James, take all the time you need. I'll be here when that day comes.\"\n", "9": "\nChapter Text\nThe church was still, filled only by the beams of deep yellow light coming through the high windows. James wasn't sure how long he'd been here- yet, this uncertainty about time was not a case of gaps or missing moments. It was more akin to slipping into a near meditative state. He'd come here straight after work, seeking out the ancient stones, warm and sandy in appearance, flanked by thick branches. A strange day- how else to describe it? James expected to currently be experiencing a sickening regret, reproaching himself for this utter loss of control and the consequences of this for him and for his Inspector. And yet, he didn't. He could not tell if what he felt was relief. No words of prayer ran through his mind; he sat, head bowed, reflecting on the day's occurrences, and even, tentatively, approaching the events of the previous night. Though it was still not entirely easy he found himself able to attempt to understand and analyse what had happened, and what his motivations had been. Defiance? Proving God knows what to God knows who? The outburst itself had not necessarily brought him to this state, or had given relief. It had been so all-consuming that he could not even now remember how it had felt to be like that- his body had taken over, his mind subsumed by it. Lewis' touch had been nice, his grip was strong, certain, telling James he was going to hold him back from the threatening abyss. It had not been arousing; that was not it at all.  He had wondered previously if he harboured such sentiments about Lewis, or if he could make himself do so, or if he he even wished that he did. He wasn't attracted to Lewis, but perhaps it was more that he would be attracted to someone like Lewis. A smile touched his mouth- well, if he'd been upset by the gulf which had opened up between them he had certainly pole-vaulted over that. He thought of what he'd said to Lewis, that one day he would explain to him about what was going on, and even now, after the storm, he found that this was a promise he intended to keep. At an earlier time the idea of so many people knowing about, well, about all of it- for James was still uncertain as to what the scope of all this was, as it certainly didn't end with Crevecoeur- would have brought on that all-too-familiar feeling of nausea. Now, however, he could almost see a place in the future where having Uncle Peter, Lewis, and well, God knowing about it would be, not necessarily fine, but rather it would be a state of affairs that would make sense, would be helpful, even. What an odd group they made, him, Peter and Lewis. Peter and his Inspector couldn't be more different if they tried to be. But yet they were connected, to him, to Inspector Morse. Uncle Peter was right, he understood that now. He couldn't help him, not with certain aspects of this. Perhaps Lewis could one day assist him with that, could be relied upon to provide support which James could never expect of his Uncle. One day. Not yet. He had to sort it out with God first. He was still growing used to having that presence available to him once more after losing the connection, after being so uncertain and so terrified for being uncertain. He did not want to be rid of his faith, he had no desire to cast off his belief. Would that simple rejection were the solution to the ongoing question of his relationship to God. No, the two of them had to work it out together unfortunately. Still, it was good to be able to reach out his hand and find God there, ready to listen, to be questioned and railed against but never to be disdained utterly. For the first time in quite some time he was glad to have possession of this belief instead of perceiving it to be hampering him or to be contributing to his confusion. \u00a0------------------------------------------------------------Peter's face betrayed little surprise when he found his nephew outside the apartment. James didn't miss the swift appraisal his uncle subjected his frame to. He surreptitiously sought to glance at Peter the same way- his grey hair was immaculate as ever, his clothes however, were slightly too loose on him, weight loss evident. Who looked after Peter, he wondered. Did his daughters come to check on him at all?  He knew better than to ask, to show any such concern. Still, it sounded as if he'd picked up the 'flu, a hacking cough seizing him at regular intervals. Or perhaps the smokes were getting to him?Peter hadn't asked why he was here, nor had he made any reference to the last phone-call they'd shared. If pushed to say why indeed he had come here James would've explained it as a need to see his uncle, to meet with him more normally, to prove that they could do that still and not always end up shouting slurs or having late night confessionals. \"It'd be easier if you lived in Oxford, I must say.\" James drawled, folding himself into the nearest available chair. \"Could pop in regularly and visit you.\" He said it in his usual tones, touched with sarcasm but he did mean it. Peter was retired, surely there was no reason to stay in London? Was it so very difficult to come back to the town of his youth? Someone could check in on him, make sure he was in better shape than he was in currently. Peter gave him a funny look before replying. \"How close do your parents live to you? How often do you go and see them?\"James inclined his head as if to say \"Fair enough\". They sat over coffee, James detailing the latest case he and Lewis had been working on, Peter giving his opinion on the strange circumstances of the lecturer's death. A lull fell in the conversation and James asked \"Do you think people are basically good?\"\"James, I didn't realise we would be discussing morality and philosophy tonight.\" \"I didn't realise we'd ever left the subjects.\" He smirked. Peter gave him a long-suffering look. \"No, no, truly, I've been wondering for a while not what you thought, as a police officer.\"\"Is this good as opposed to anything else? Are we including the idea of evil in this as well, or is it just a question of basic goodness?\" \"Well, evil is another question entirely, but yes, let's include evil in this idea.\" Another reason why he had come to visit his uncle- there weren't many other people, if any at all, with whom he could have such conversations. He enjoyed the rhythm of their talks, the challenge of it. \"What's brought this on? Are you still thinking about Zelinsky?\"\"Partially, I suppose.\" He didn't need to say anything further. Of course he still thought about Zelinsky and Peter had to be aware of that. \"I don't think people are basically good, or bad. People are basically self-centred, hard-wired to do their best to ensure their own survival, and once that condition has been met their main concern is seeking that which is pleasurable to them. People don't do things based on morals, they act based on desires, and fears too, and then justify it to themselves.\" Peter glanced over at James. \"Ah. Should've guessed that wouldn't sit well with you. I'll stick by it though because if anything that's what I've taken away from my time as a copper. I forgot that you believe in souls and confession and all that.\" \"You don't think we've had any higher feeling bestowed upon us?\"\"Yes. But only some of us live by it. A few of us rise up above the selfishness of existence and listen to that feeling on a sporadic basis. Those are the moments when people are 'good'. But I don't believe we are good at our core.\"\"But if you believe that people aren't basically good then do you believe the opposite, that no-one is basically bad, or evil?\"Peter took a breath in before replying. \"Yes, that's just what I think.\"\"How? How can you say that?\" James asked more forcefully than he had intended. \"You're the one who believes in God and absolution. According to your holy book, if someone is contrite then God forgives them. Surely that implies that no-one is evil if we are all redeemable and all we have to do is ask?\" Peter extracted a cigarette from the packet lying near him. \"It took me a long time but eventually I had to admit to myself that there is not a huge difference between me and those men at Blenheim Vale.\" He lit the cigarette; the light flickering around his face made him appear even older than he was, looking even haggard. Perhaps I have done this to him, James thought; my presence and my story has done this to him, brought far too much back from the past. \"Peter, what can you mean by that?\" And yet he pressed on with his questions- because he simply had to, it was who he was, he had to know, had to interrogate. \"Those men used their position to satisfy their- their needs. When I was a Sergeant I sold inside information about cases to the papers because my most urgent need was money.\" His hand remained lightly curled, held in front of his face, the cigarette burning. His gaze was unfocused. In spite of the ease with which he spoke, James sensed that this argument, though accepted by his uncle and rehearsed a thousand times, was still one he struggled with. \"I never wanted to be poor again. Being poor meant being powerless. So I abused my position and my power for personal gain. The only difference between me and the men at Blenheim Vale is that of degree.\" \"You put what you did on a par with...with...\" James gestured helplessly. \"Yes. It helps. I don't know if you can understand that?\"James found himself biting his thumb and removed the digit from his mouth. \"At the moment, no.\"\"Thinking of them like that makes them less terrifying to me. When I was younger I made myself forget, that was how I dealt with Blenheim Vale. That didn't last of course, so I needed to do something else. I had to do what Morse tried to give me- to have some sort of agency. If I think of those men as weak people led around by their perverted desires then I can place myself on an even footing with them. But to think of them as evil, as monsters, that makes them more than human, more powerful than I can ever be, and it makes me a child again. To a small child, they were monsters, horrible figures, massive in size, over-pow-\" Peter fell silent. \"It's not that I'm trying to minimise what they did.\" He resumed. \"I still wish they could've been punished for all they did. For me, I will always judge them guilty, no matter what Jesus thinks. But I feel stronger in myself if I think of them just as men. Otherwise I would have to entertain the idea that evil picked me. Instead, I was just a child who couldn't defend himself and who happened to be in the wrong place and met the wrong people. If I accept that they were evil, then I have to see myself as having attracted evil. So instead I rob them of their monstrosity.\"James thought of how jarring it had been to see Lord Mortmaigne, how he had become an elderly man. It had seemed wrong to him- he didn't deserve to ever become a mild-looking old man, his appearance needed to match the sensations and fragments of memory James allowed himself to have. It was beyond his comprehension to stand before Lord Mortmaigne, to stand there a tall and well-dressed man. It panicked him, that people would never believe he had once been subject to what had happened in the summerhouse, and that this shuffling figure would not be recognised for the tormentor and abuser he had been, someone who had once been able to overpower him. James closed his eyes. He had to stop there. Another time. Another time. It was too much just now. \"James?\"\"I'm sorry, Uncle Peter. I'm simply not ready to entertain such an idea yet. For me, he's still a monster.\" And I, he silently added, am still a child.\n"}}, "4646244": {"Bookmarks:": "4", "Chapters:": "1/1", "Words:": "8752", "Characters:": ["Robert Lewis", "James Hathaway", "Laura Hobson (mentioned)"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Friends With Benefits", "Rating:": ["Explicit"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Robert Lewis"], "Published:": "2015-08-24", "Category:": ["M/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Kudos:": "76", "Summary": "\nThe movie ends.

He doesn\u2019t feel squiffy or befuddled, but what else would explain that, on his first free Friday evening in three, long, hectic weeks, he\u2019s sitting on the couch with James, watching a silly film? A silly romantic comedy, at that.James had been flipping through channels during a break in the football match and stopped, presumably to gawp at the stunningly beautiful actress wearing very little clothing. And daft as it is, they\u2019d never even checked back for a score on the match. Instead, they\u2019ve watched almost all the film, laughing at the improbable situations and turns of plot and never once at themselves. Maybe it's just that he's aled up, as his granddad would have said, but at the moment, there\u2019s no place Robbie\u2019d rather be on a Friday night than drinking with James and listening to his running commentary on a silly film. He\u2019s not sure what that says about the state of his life.  This time six months ago, it would have been him and Laura. It\u2019s shameful to admit, but...he suspects that he wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed himself half as much. They would have been drinking wine instead of trying one of the newer bottled beers, and they probably would have never bothered to watch something like this. If they had, he\u2019s sure Laura, who prefers silence from the audience while she\u2019s watching telly, would have neither provided nor appreciated James\u2019s acerbic comments. Robbie sometimes regrets that things didn\u2019t work out with Laura. He misses her sometimes. But, mostly, it\u2019s just a relief to be on his own. It\u2019s lonelier, but it\u2019s easier at the same time, and they\u2019re both more satisfied. And they sure as hell like each other better, now that they\u2019re slowly coming back around to that place where they were good as friends. He takes another drink of his beer and taps his fingers to the beat of the song playing in the film. And chuckles to himself as he wonders if the day might come when he and Laura could be friends with benefits. That might be...interesting. It would certainly be less lonely than a cold bed and his own hand. But does it ever really work in real life? Can two people, especially two people who already have a history, really manage to make the physical side of things work without allowing emotional expectations to creep in? He doubts it, and apparently, Hollywood agrees.On the telly, the couple kisses, happily ever after. The music swells and credits roll. \n\nJames sighs as if he\u2019s sorry to see the end of it. He points the remote at the screen and lowers the volume to almost nothing. And, as if he\u2019s reading Robbie\u2019s mind, he asks. \u201cSo...are you and Laura friends with benefits?\u201d His tone has changed, from acidic and droll to almost studiedly casual, so Robbie knows it\u2019s not a wind-up. James is genuinely interested. Despite what he\u2019s just been thinking, Robbie answers seriously. \u201cNah, lad. Best for us to just try to be friends, I think.\u201d James gives a little grimace, perhaps in sympathy. He\u2019s sprawled on the couch like he hasn\u2019t a bone in his lanky body, big head lolled back like it\u2019s too heavy for his neck, and he nods without lifting it. And he keeps on nodding, mouth turned down at the corners. It looks like he\u2019s got a rhythm going to some beat Robbie can\u2019t hear. \u2018Too much beer for him, too, then\u2019, Robbie thinks, although the sure-fire evidence that James has had a bit too much\u2014the drooping eyelids and slightly slurred vowels\u2014isn\u2019t there. Robbie\u2019s not really drunk enough for his tongue to be so loose, but once James asks, once the ball is rolling in his mind, Robbie can\u2019t seem to stop himself. He twists a bit so that he can see James\u2019s face clearly and asks, \u201cHave you ever had a friend with benefits, then?\u201dEven after all their years as partners and friends, James can still be tight and closed off about personal details, but he doesn\u2019t seem to mind the intimacy of this question. He shakes his head by simply rolling it back and forth on the back of the couch, his neck still boneless and lax. Back and forth. Back and forth, like a patient on a hypnotist\u2019s couch. It makes Robbie a bit dizzy. \u201cNo,\u201d James says, \u201cI\u2019d need a friend first.\u201d His voice isn\u2019t maudlin, or slurred with drink, or filled with pity for himself. Just...heartbreakingly down to earth. Like he\u2019s stating a simple fact. At least, a simple fact as he sees it. Robbie\u2019s heart twinges, as it always does, at the difference between the way James sees himself and the way Robbie sees him. And he protests, \u201cWell, I\u2019m your friend.\u201d James goes still, and he looks at Robbie without lifting his head from the couch, just twisting his long, elegant neck. And his lovely, changeable\u2014sometimes blue, sometimes green, sometimes an extraordinary combination of both\u2014eyes flash with some emotion Robbie can\u2019t read. James\u2019s gaze moves over him with the weight of a caress, down his body and back up again to his mouth. The pink tip of James\u2019s tongue slides along his bottom lip, leaving it shiny and wet. And James smiles at him, lazy and speculative. Robbie sits up a little straighter. He\u2019s not so drunk that he doesn\u2019t realize how the words that just spilled out of his mouth must have sounded. He\u2019s not so pissed that he doesn\u2019t understand how they could be misconstrued. And James has misconstrued what Robbie said, hasn\u2019t he? There\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s what that flirtatious, heated gaze means. But, then, there\u2019s a little quirk, quickly controlled, at the corner of James\u2019s mouth. And Robbie relaxes back against the couch, smiling and shaking his head. James got him with that one, didn\u2019t he? He does, most every time, with his teasing. Always making Robbie blink before he remembers that James has always gone on like that. Always pretend-flirted with coy gazes and playful smiles and his gently mocking phone-sex voice. \u2018It\u2019s a good thing we found each other then, Sir.\u2019 \u2018I think you\u2019d better explain, darling.\u2019 \u2018I couldn\u2019t figure out how to break up with you.\u2019  But this time...there\u2019s no teasing sarcasm after that little quirk of a smile. James just keeps looking at him. Staring at Robbie like he\u2019s waiting for something. Robbie concentrates, trying to focus the hazy edges of his brain. Trying to figure out whether he\u2019s missed something. Because something about this, about the way James is looking at him, feels different from that pretend-flirting. This feels real. James\u2019s smile is more predatory than sarcastic, and his eyes are sparkling with intensity. And his tongue trails a line of shine along up his upper lip to match the one on his lower lip. And, no, Robbie realizes, it\u2019s not a pretence at all! It\u2019s not a teasing game. James is staring at him as if he\u2019d like to devour him. How long since anybody has looked at him like that?A sizzle that\u2019s a bit like touching super-heated metal with a wet fingertip simmers along Robbie\u2019s nerves. And he wants, with a sudden ache that pierces through to his bones. His fingers clench with anticipation. Longing heats him from the inside out, flushing across his skin like flowing sunlight. He wants...without knowing precisely what he wants, and the shock of realizing it, the shock of admitting it, is astounding. It must show on his face, his surprise, the sudden flare of desire. It must be evident in his sudden, sharp intake of breath. Because James bursts into motion and sits forward. Deposits his beer bottle on the side table. And then, slowing again, giving Robbie plenty of time to protest, James turns, slides back, leans down. Slowly. So slowly, so carefully, he puts his face in Robbie\u2019s lap and nuzzles him through his trousers. Robbie\u2019s shocked enough, pissed enough, that he doesn\u2019t react, not even when he sees his friend\u2019s head in his lap.  But he\u2019s not so drunk he doesn\u2019t know he should react, even if time has suddenly gone weird, and he\u2019s moving and thinking as if his brain is ten seconds behind everything that\u2019s happening. He knows he should reach down and thump James on the back of his big blond head. Give him a shove. Laugh and make some rude comment. Make it all a big joke. Before the slow hum of arousal that\u2019s stirring in his blood becomes a shout. Before he\u2019s too hard to pretend this isn\u2019t what he wants. Because he might not have known a moment ago, but he knows now. This is what he wants. Exactly what he wants. James\u2019s passion and daring. Robbie wants someone to want him like this. He wants James to want him like this, with his cheeky, bold hunger. A slow, sultry arousal curls up and out of his gut, skating along the edges of his bones, waking skin and nerves. And doesn\u2019t his breath sound odd? Slow and even, but laboured and loud in the quiet room.  James breathes audibly, too, huffing hot air through the layers of Robbie\u2019s trousers and pants. Blood, slow and thick, shifts in Robbie\u2019s veins in rhythm to the slow, grinding throb of his heartbeat. His cock swells, responding to the feel of James\u2019s mouth, to the warm, humid breath sifting through the layers of fabric. He raises his hand. There\u2019s still time to push James away. To stop the slide of James\u2019s hand up his thigh. To cover his zip so that he can\u2019t feel James\u2019s cloying, hot breath, curling around him. Everything is moving so slowly, there\u2019s still time. He\u2019s getting hard, but there\u2019s still time for sanity. His hand hovers in midair while he sifts through his thoughts, trying to choose between common sense and insanity. Like lines on an off-kilter map, the choices overlap, twist, fork, the paths between what he should do and what he wants to do splitting off in opposite directions. James\u2019s teeth fracture any chance Robbie had of taking the sane path. Not James\u2019s breath, swirling hot and sultry around him. Not the grip of James\u2019s fingers, sliding up his thigh, curling around his hip, thumb digging in. James\u2019s teeth. Teeth scraping across his jeans, following the curve of his erection. Teeth biting down, just past the edge of gentle, on the head of his cock. Robbie\u2019s breath slams back into his lungs like he\u2019s been slapped, and arousal surges through him. No sultry swelling, no slow, sexy throb of heartbeat and pulse now. This is as jagged and hot as an electrical charge. As sharp and piercing as incisors and canines. It\u2019s terrifying and thrilling. Pleasure washes through him and wipes out any chance he had of being smart, of being wise. Of anything more than the most primal thought. Every muscle in his body seizes and his hand clamps down on the back of James\u2019s head. Robbie groans, shoulders pressing back into the couch as he rolls his hips, pressing up into that sharp,  dangerous pressure. Wordlessly begging for more. His other hand comes up to cup the top of James\u2019s head. As if his body shoved into James\u2019s face, his hands holding James\u2019s head in position, the sounds scraping out of his throat, aren\u2019t answer enough, James rasps onto his cock, \u201cDo you want me to?\u201d Tilting his head so those fiery eyes glitter up at him, full of heat and mischief. Daring him. Wanting him. Demanding that he acknowledge his own desire. Robbie knows what his answer should be. But he\u2019s too far gone to resist the challenge, the passion, in those eyes. It\u2019s daft. Foolhardy. And he can\u2019t remember the last time he wanted something so badly. He grates out, \u201cYes,\u201d rasping and gruff, and lifts even higher, tilting his hips, begging for James to keep touching him with his beautiful mouth, his hot breath. His sharp white teeth. James smiles up at him, catlike and evil, and unzips him. Drags his cock out through his flies and swallows him down. No finesse, no gentle build-up. Just a greedy gulp that slides the tip of his cock along the roof of James\u2019s mouth, into the rippling confines of James\u2019s throat. Robbie\u2019s hips jerk forward and his head snaps back. And, Christ!, it\u2019s all he can do not to shout.  He\u2019s had blowjobs before. Spectacular ones. But no one\u2019s ever taken him all the way down like that with one greedy, sliding gulp. Stars explode behind his eyelids and his heart balloons like it\u2019s been filled to bursting, then settles to a punishing, pounding rhythm. Pleasure like lightning spangles out across his hips and up his back. Robbie curses and has to force himself not to shove up. Not to thrust his cock even deeper into the wet, sucking heat. Everything tightens, thighs, fingers, balls, muscles contracting. He\u2019s going to come. Just that fast. Just from that one greedy, nasty, wet slurp. As if James realizes how close he is, he backs off quickly. Mouth sliding away with a lazy twist of tongue. James slips his fingers inside Robbie\u2019s clothing and tugs at his balls, stroking, caressing, easing him back from the edge of orgasm much more gently than he shoved Robbie towards it. The hard, tight burn eases, recedes to a glowing ache. Becomes a fire that needs to be stoked before it can flame. Robbie groans in protest and pushes his knees wider apart. Wanting...more. Everything. Wanting that intense sensation back, the breathtaking, screaming pleasure of being sucked all the way down like that. But James only settles to stroking and teasing the length of him with his tongue and rough, callused fingertips. Slowing Robbie down, starting the climb all over again. James presses sucking kisses along the underside of his shaft. Blows puffs of air over the saliva-slickened skin. The warmth flashing to cold sends shivers up and down Robbie\u2019s spine. James rubs just the front of his teeth along the curve of Robbie\u2019s cock, then nips him with only the soft touch of his lips. Gentle. Playful. No teeth. No pain. Only the remembered threat of sharpness. Robbie gasps, heat racing over his body, and freezes. He knows James would never hurt him. He knows. But...the risk is there. The possibility is there. It makes his heart thud, sweat break out in the small of his back. He holds his breath, quivering, fingers flexing on James's head as he waits for what comes next. Fearful, anticipating... Wanting a danger he didn\u2019t even know he craved.And James laughs. Soft and low. Like he knows that Robbie\u2019s hovering between pleasure and fear. Shocked to be aroused by it. James nips again with his lips, then soothes the spot with a touch of tongue so light it\u2019s like a brush of butterfly wings on Robbie\u2019s skin. And then swallows him down again, rough and perfect. Robbie has to remind himself to breathe. Tension building again, slower at first, but then speeding again as mixed sensation\u2014hint of sharpness that never comes, fluttering tongue, rough one moment, slick and soft the next\u2014scatters across his skin like fiery glitter. Silver, spangling heat arcs over his whole body as James finds the sweet spot on his cock with quick, delicate flicks of his tongue. Robbie tightens his fingers, moulding to the pleasing curve of James\u2019s skull, as he tries to hold James\u2019s head in place, guide him. He begs in a rough, shattered tone, \u201cThere. Right there! James, for god\u2019s sake.\u201d James hums laughter down the length of his cock. Swallows the length of him down again. Wanton. Lewd. Moaning around his cock as if he likes what he\u2019s doing as much as Robbie likes him doing it. James\u2019s mouth slides off him, tongue dances over him, teasing. Flicking. Licking. Pressing. Doing what Robbie wanted, then dancing away. Robbie\u2019s never been with anyone who could do this. Keep him balanced, quivering, on a knife edge between fast and slow, rough and gentle, and never quite enough of either. And with a rush of lust that makes his face flush even hotter, Robbie wants to see James doing all that to him. He shifts, tilting his body and pushing at James\u2019s head. And James knows. The way he\u2019s always anticipated what Robbie wants.  James shifts, turning his shoulders so that Robbie can see him run his tongue from the base all the way up to the tip of his cock. James suckles him, tugs gently at his foreskin, then dips inside to circle just the tip of Robbie's cock, tongue extended so that Robbie can see what he\u2019s doing. James watches him as Robbie watches. Takes the thick length into his mouth. Cheeks hollowing. Slowly. Slowly. Vulgar and sensual and scorching. Lips sinking down Robbie\u2019s cock. And then slowly, agonizingly, pulls away. Lets him go with a lewd pop. James does that slippery, circling move with his tongue again at the tip of Robbie\u2019s cock. He flicks his tongue and air dances on Robbie\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a sexy, nasty, entrancing performance, all for Robbie\u2019s benefit. And the whole time, James\u2019s gaze is on him, eyes narrowed and wicked. And it\u2019s too much, the heat and challenge in those bright eyes. There\u2019s no way Robbie can pull it back now, the rush of orgasm, because everything James is doing, with tongue and fingers and breath, with his sinfully glittering gaze, is magical. Fire and ice and shining, sweet heat. Robbie gasps as every muscle in his body contracts like a switch has been thrown. Every nerve ending lights up with pleasure. He has time to groan a warning. \u201cJames...\u201d But instead of pulling away, as Robbie expected, James shifts back to his original position and  swallows him again. The ridged, hot, slick roof of his mouth slides across the tip of Robbie's cock, tongue dancing and curling along the underside. James hums a hungry, greedy sound, and swallows around him, making his intention, his desire, clear. Robbie groans, \u201cOh, god...\u201d and explodes. Burning, electrifying, pulsing sensation. Good, so good. Washing over him. Good. Through him. Good, good, good. His thighs tremble with the tension, and his balls draw up so tight it hurts. The small of his back twinges a warning as he twists, lifting his hips higher. Heat engulfs him as he comes, holding James\u2019s head and thrusting roughly into James\u2019s mouth. James moves with him, accommodating his thrusts, and moans his approval. Rippling, swallowing sensations as James drinks him down. And that sends another rush of pleasure crashing through Robbie. Ecstasy rips up his spine and his body contracts again, harder, muscles that are already tight and knotted bunching even tighter. He has to jerk his hands away from James\u2019s head to keep from fucking James\u2019s mouth even harder. He shudders, breath bottomed out in his lungs. Gasping, but there\u2019s no air getting in. Fire blazing  along his nerves. It\u2019s so good it\u2019s almost too good. So good it hurts. So good he\u2019s going to disappear. Go up in smoke. And just when he thinks he can\u2019t take any more, the sensations ease. Drop off. He feels like he\u2019s climbed and climbed and then been flung, screaming, down a steep slope, and now he\u2019s hit the bottom and levelled out. Moving slower and slower. Rolling to a slow, throbbing stop. His muscles un-knot, one by one. Lengthen. And he slumps back onto the couch, limp and wasted, shivering with aftershocks. James sucks at him gently. Soothing him with lips and tongue. Cleaning him gently with little cat-like licks and soft kisses. Lapping at him until it\u2019s too much, and he has to put his hand on James\u2019s neck and squeeze gently to let him know to stop. James pulls back and rests his head on Robbie\u2019s belly. Both of them, gasping in unison. Hot gusts of air caress his softened cock as James gets his breath back.Robbie strokes the soft, bristly curve of James\u2019s skull. It\u2019s something he\u2019s always wanted to do, touch James\u2019s hair. Run his palm against the grain and feel that stubbly rasp of short, short hair. It\u2019s softer than he thought it would be. If it wasn\u2019t so short, he imagines James\u2019s hair would feel like silk flowing between his fingers. He sighs. James sighs with him, rolling his head under the caress of Robbie\u2019s fingers. And Robbie\u2019s suddenly back in the present. Suddenly aware of where he is. Of what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s just let a man go down on him. Just had a friend\u2019s mouth on his cock. James\u2019s mouth. He just came in his friend\u2019s mouth. Shoved him down and held him while he pumped his mouth full... Heat flushes his face. Shock cramps his belly. His fingers spasm on James\u2019s head. James shifts, sliding back to sit up. James\u2019s chest rises and falls as he breathes, quick and shallow. His lips are parted, flushed from friction and use. Wet with saliva and semen. His pupils are contracted to pinpricks, all stunning blue and green, like he\u2019s been out in bright sunlight. He swallows, tongue darting out to touch his bottom lip... And he\u2019s gorgeous. Robbie\u2019s never seen him more beautiful than he is right now. Sex-rumpled and flushed, lips red and swollen from the way Robbie\u2019s used him. James swallowing. James\u2019s tongue moving on him... Robbie\u2019s face gets hotter, circles burning on his cheekbones. James leans back, gaze locked on Robbie\u2019s face. Reaches down to adjust himself in his trousers. And, oh... Oh.  Of course. James is hard. His erection pressing up, obvious in his tight jeans. Robbie can tell from the way James\u2019s hand lingers that he\u2019s aching. Can tell from the way James\u2019s gaze is locked on him what he\u2019s wanting. That he\u2019s waiting. James pushes his knees wide apart. Inviting... Wets his lips again. Enticing... Waiting. His gaze holds Robbie\u2019s prisoner. Desire that should be slaked and sleeping leaps in Robbie. That pre-orgasm drumbeat starts up in his chest again. His breath stutters in rhythm with his thoughts, uncertainty and doubt fluttering against his skull. He\u2019s never done this. Touched a man like this. But his body is ahead of his brain. Again. He reaches out, not quite believing he\u2019s doing it, not quite ready to do it, but moving anyway. He puts his hand on James\u2019s thigh. James\u2019s eyes slide closed, and he breathes out a sigh of relief. And it\u2019s easier now, with James\u2019s eyes closed. Easier without the burning scrutiny. The muscle under Robbie\u2019s palm contracts, the hard curve inviting him to slide his hand further. He slides his hand under James\u2019s hand. Cups the bulge in James\u2019s jeans. And that\u2019s...Robbie huffs out a breath...impressive. James\u2019s skin is radiating heat, even through his clothing. And James\u2019s cock is rock hard and has to be even longer than his. Robbie suddenly, improbably, wants to see. Wants to touch with his bare hands, not through layers of denim and cotton. James must be reading his mind, because he slides his hand back under Robbie\u2019s and makes quick work of his button and zip. Impatiently shoves his jeans open and down. Tugs the hem of his t-shirt up above his navel. No pants. James isn\u2019t wearing pants. Robbie swallows, a little tingle of near arousal slithering down his spine. It\u2019s sexy, thinking that James has been beside him all evening, no pants on beneath his tight jeans. How often has James done this through the years, walked down the street with him, sat beside him, at work, eating dinner, watching telly, with his cock bare, rubbing against the underside of his zip? If Robbie had known...would he have thought about doing this with James before now? Would it have made him hard? He shivers. Shivers again as James\u2019s hands slide away, and his naked cock springs up against Robbie\u2019s naked palm. Robbie sucks in air through his teeth. His mind skitters sideways. There\u2019s a hard, hot cock in his hand. Not his own. Another man\u2019s cock in his hand. James\u2019s cock in his hand. It\u2019s the only one, except for his own, that he\u2019s ever held. His fingers curl around it automatically. Squeeze and slide along the length. His hand knows what to do, even if his brain is careening wildly inside his skull. And he was right. James\u2019s cock is longer than his. Leaner and paler, with a head like a dark pink plum. Flushed with blood. Shiny wet and glistening with precome. It\u2019s gorgeous. James is gorgeous, sprawled back in the corner of the couch, the muscles in his flat, hard stomach rippling with each breath, flush spreading down from under the edge of his t-shirt and painting the sharp edges of his hipbones. Robbie strokes him, testing the weight and heft of the rigid shaft, the smooth, hot skin. It feels...different, somehow. The same, but different from his own. James groans. Pleasure and entreaty. Lifting his hips, the way Robbie lifted his, in invitation, encouraging Robbie to continue.  Robbie\u2019s tongue darts out, wetting his lips as he contemplates...doing more than just touching another man\u2019s cock. His mind might be coming around to touching James this way, but he\u2019s not sure about doing more. But it\u2019s only fair, isn\u2019t it? Considering what James just did for him... He leans down, tentative. Gathering his courage. James stops him with a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d His  voice is husky and hopeful, his touch hot and trembling. \u201cYour hand\u2019s good.\u201d Robbie looks at the cock in his fist and realizes he does want to. His mind is pulsing with a mix of uncertainty and nervousness, but he\u2019s excited, too. Quivering with anticipation. He wants to. He just doesn\u2019t have a clue how. But...he\u2019s a good detective, right? He can figure this out. He knows what he likes to have done to him. And he\u2019s just had a damn good lesson in how to do it right. Surely he can follow James\u2019s example...He bends down, awkward and unsure, bracing his weight on one elbow, and tastes. Just a tentative lick at the tip of James\u2019s beautiful cock. Shock sizzles down his spine. James tastes good. Salty and almost sweet. He leans closer and tries to copy that circling movement that James\u2019s was doing with his tongue. Remembering the way it made him curl his toes and arch his back. And he likes the heat, the smooth, silky roundness of the tip of James\u2019s cock beneath his tongue. He likes the way a shiver passes through James. The way he moans. A soft, throaty, sinful sound. He can do this. If it will make James moan, make his beautiful voice curl, low and rasping, the way his breath curled around Robbie\u2019s cock, then he can do this and more. Will do it, just to hear that sound again. Robbie\u2019s shocked at how eager he is, at how much he likes it, as he uses his lips and his tongue. Pressing kisses the way James did. Following with his tongue. Licking across the heat and hardness, searching for that spot on James\u2019s cock, the one that will make him moan. Robbie finds it, that sweet spot, lower on the shaft than his, and James hisses, arches up. Fingers clenching into fists as he presses them into the couch cushions.Shocking, how much Robbie likes what he\u2019s doing. How he\u2019s shaking with excitement. Elation rushes through him as he closes his mouth on the tip of James\u2019s cock, and James whispers a long, drawn-out, \u201cYes.\u201d Robbie dares to look up. James is sitting up high, no longer slumped. His back is arched, shoulders pressed into the back of the couch. And his gaze is locked on Robbie. Watching Robbie\u2019s mouth move on him. His fingers open slowly, unclenching. He lifts one hand to Robbie\u2019s shoulder and his fingers work convulsively, nails scraping at Robbie\u2019s shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he says, his voice hoarse. Robbie understands, now, why a man would do this. Take another man\u2019s cock into his mouth. Caress him and whip him and goad him with lips and tongue. There\u2019s power and strength in it, the giving of pleasure this way. It\u2019s exhilarating to taste James. To make him shiver and moan. There\u2019s heady pleasure in knowing that he can make James sound like that, make him fall apart. He tilts his head back down and takes James in his mouth. James gasps and threads his fingers through Robbie\u2019s hair. Robbie shudders at the sensation, at the pressure, at what he knows is coming. James is going to use him, the way he used James. \u2018It\u2019s only fair...\u2019 a little voice whispers in his mind. James\u2019s hands open and close on his scalp, press, gently at first, then roughly. Guiding his mouth. Begging with fingertips. Do that. Move this way. Do that again.  But James doesn\u2019t push too hard. James\u2019s hands aren\u2019t nearly as rough on him as his were on James. James is just demanding enough to send a thrill through him. Just forceful enough to make him wish James would be a little rougher. Robbie shivers as he imagines James using him a little harder. But it\u2019s good that James doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s not as expert as James. Not yet. Robbie doesn\u2019t dare use the threat of teeth, even carefully shielded, the way James did. He doesn\u2019t dare attempt the little nips with his lips. And he can\u2019t take the length of James\u2019s cock down his throat. Not yet. But he remembers a girlfriend, decades ago, who couldn\u2019t swallow his cock very far down, and the way she compensated for his length and girth with her hand. And James likes that. Robbie\u2019s hand, circling his cock at the base, giving short, half strokes while he uses his tongue, circling and teasing, the way James did to him. It makes James shudder and moan and arch his long spine. Gasp, voice husky and wrecked, \u201cOh, god,\u201d and \u201cRobbie,\u201d and \u201cPlease. Again. Like that. Again.\u201d Other words that Robbie can\u2019t understand. Latin or Italian or maybe French, maybe just nonsense, garbled with pleasure. But he doesn\u2019t have to comprehend the words to know what they mean. To know that he\u2019s pleasing James. To know that he\u2019s winding him, tighter and tighter, bringing him closer to orgasm. James likes it even better when he strokes, rough and tight, while he teases the sensitive spot on the shaft with his tongue. He urges, \u201cHarder! God, Robbie, harder!\u201d And then, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 Yes. That\u2019s... Oh...\u201d Under his hand, James\u2019s thigh bunches, goes rock hard. And his trembling and moaning stutter to a stop. James\u2019s hands tighten on Robbie\u2019s skull, and he warns, \u201cRobbie! I\u2019m...\u201d James\u2019s cock jerks in his hand. A strong, muscular twitch. And before Robbie can decide whether he wants to pull away, James groans and spills over his fingers and tongue. The taste is bitter and altogether enticing when his mind tells him it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s thick and salty, hinting at a musky, funky sweetness, and disgustingly slick, all at the same time. And Robbie slides his mouth over as much of James as he can, and he sucks and swallows. James groans his name and his fingers tighten painfully in Robbie\u2019s hair. It's enthralling, experiencing James\u2019s orgasm. Hearing James say his name that way. Feeling James arch and twist, shove himself towards Robbie\u2019s mouth. Robbie\u2019s not as good at swallowing as James was, and semen spills out of the sides of his mouth, down over his fingers. Wetting them. Slicking the movement of his hand on James\u2019s shaft, and James shudders. Gasps as if he likes knowing that Robbie\u2019s strokes are suddenly slick and easy  because of his own semen. The texture is disgusting, but the taste isn't bad, and the idea, that he\u2019s sucking a man\u2019s cock and swallowing his come, is surprisingly, shockingly exciting. Electrifying. James\u2019s obvious pleasure, his body stuttering and rocking as he shudders through an intense orgasm, is exhilarating. Addictive. James groans one last time, and then his fingers relax and his body slumps back on the couch. Robbie starts to pull away, but remembers the soft, humming pleasure of James\u2019s tongue on him as he was coming down from his orgasm, and he teases gently, carefully, at James\u2019s softening cock. Robbie\u2019s better than James was at reading body language, though. He senses the moment his caresses go from pleasurable to too much, and he stops before James has to push him away. Rests his head on James\u2019s lean belly and tries to get his breath back. He\u2019s surprised to find that he\u2019s gasping. That his heart is thundering. His lips feel bruised and sensitive. He\u2019s hyperaware of the heat of James\u2019s skin against his face, the thump of James\u2019s heartbeat against his ear, the rasp of James\u2019s breath, slowly returning to normal. Of James\u2019s hands, cupping his skull gently. Of James\u2019s fingers, moving, massaging his scalp, stroking the back of his neck, his shoulders. It feels good. Nice. But it\u2019s not enough to keep him from feeling the ache in his jaws. And so much more. Aware of what he\u2019s just done. Of what they\u2019ve just done. Of the taste of James in his mouth. Of slickness smeared across his cheek and down his chin. Between his fingers. It\u2019s easy to stay there with his head resting on James, even though his back is protesting the way his spine is twisted, and the slickness on his face and fingers is quickly cooling to sticky and itchy. Because as long as he stays where he is, James will keep rubbing his shoulders with those long, soothing strokes. And he won\u2019t have to face James. He won't have to figure out how he\u2019s supposed to react. How he feels about what they just did. How he feels about how much he enjoyed it. He won\u2019t have to figure out what he\u2019s supposed to say now. Do now. Should he sit up and be casual? Laugh it off? Pretend he\u2019s drunker than he is? Because he doesn\u2019t feel drunk right now on anything other than what they\u2019ve just done. Maybe...maybe the first step would be to sit up. To let go. He\u2019s still slumped against James with James\u2019s softened, warm, slightly sticky cock lying nestled in his equally sticky hand. Robbie twitches, pulls his hand away. And James surges into movement. Helping Robbie to sit up with a push on his shoulder. Tugging  his jeans up over his narrow hips, holding the edges closed. Standing and walking away, mumbling that he needs to clean up. Robbie watches James\u2019s retreating back, disappointed for no reason he can fathom. But what did he expect? That they\u2019d cuddle after, like new lovers? Put their heads together for pillow talk like an old married couple? But that\u2019s what Robbie knows. Kisses and cuddling. Sweet nonsense whispered against fragrant skin. That\u2019s what he accustomed to, after sex. Is that why he\u2019s feeling let down? Because that\u2019s daft. It\u2019s easier this way, right? James walking away gives him a minute to breathe. To put himself back together. Figure things out. Robbie stands and starts to rearrange his trousers and realizes that if he touches himself, he\u2019s going to smear the remains of what they\u2019ve just done all over his clothing. He flushes hot with embarrassment as he goes into the kitchen and washes his hands and his face. He can hear the water running in the bathroom. James probably doing the same thing, washing Robbie off his hands, washing his semen off his belly where Robbie\u2019s inexperience let it spill and streak. The idea causes a gnawing sensation in his belly, almost like he\u2019s hungry. His shirt feels like it\u2019s twisted around his ribs, and he straightens it, smoothes it down into his trousers. His cock is sensitive, like his tongue, achy like his jaws. His face burns even hotter and his hands shake as he tucks and straightens and zips up. Robbie gets them both a fresh, cold beer from the fridge. Backtracks to pour the old, warm ones down the drain and throw the bottles into the trash. He\u2019s shocked to find that they\u2019ve both had only three beers each, plus what they\u2019d drunk from the partial bottles he just poured out. So they weren\u2019t as pissed as he thought. Maybe...what happened can\u2019t be blamed on lowered inhibitions? Almost four bottles of beer, consumed over the whole evening, with takeaway, is not enough beer to allow him to do what he just did. Not enough beer for him to be able to lay the blame on the doorstep of too much drink. What the hell is he going to say to James now? He takes a couple of big swigs of his fresh beer, but it doesn\u2019t wash the taste of James from his mouth. As he drops back down into his spot on the couch, he realizes he doesn\u2019t particularly want it to. Delayed embarrassment and shaking hands aside, he doesn\u2019t really want to drop into a pit of regret. And he doesn\u2019t want to pretend that nothing happened. Or berate himself for foolish behaviour. It was different and strange, but he liked the way James tasted. The way James moved under his hands and his mouth. He liked being able to make James gasp with pleasure. It\u2019s even more of a shock than what they\u2019ve just done, to realize that he doesn\u2019t want to let go of the way touching James made him feel. To realize that he\u2019d like to have James\u2019s mouth on him again. The weight of James\u2019s hands on him again. James\u2019s gaze, burning him. Daring him.  He hopes... What? That James feels the same way? That they can do it again? Does he want to do it again? Should he be even considering it?James comes back into the room before he can figure any of it out. Robbie\u2019s sitting on the edge of the couch. Thinking. Thinking so hard it feels like his forehead is creased with it. And he doesn\u2019t know what to say, or the answers to any of the questions he\u2019s been asking himself, and even if he did, he\u2019s not sure he would know how to tell James. Except...looking at James, hesitating there at the end of the couch, he knows one thing with strength and certainty. This doesn\u2019t feel wrong. Foolhardy, maybe. Even a little dangerous, reckless in the best sort of way. But touching James, being touched by James, will never feel wrong. Feeling James come apart with pleasure under his hands will never feel wrong. And with that acceptance comes the certainty that, no matter what, it\u2019ll be okay. He and James will always find a way to be okay. Robbie points to the beer he\u2019s set on the table. \u201cGot you a fresh one.\u201d And he relaxes back on the couch. Discovers that, underneath his nervousness, there\u2019s a bone-deep, delicious relaxation. He drops his head back on the couch. The tension drains out of him. James quirks an eyebrow at him. Unsure. Questioning. Without raising his head, Robbie pats the spot on the couch beside him. And that seems to do the trick. James drops down beside him with an \u2018Oof!\u2019, like he\u2019s boneless and tired, too. He picks up the cold beer and takes a drink from it. Rests it on his knee. From the corners of his eyes, Robbie watches the way James\u2019s throat moves as he swallows. His gaze traces the lovely, elegant curve of James\u2019s neck and throat. James slumps, dropping his head back onto the couch, mimicking Robbie\u2019s boneless sprawl. His knee and his elbow bump up against Robbie. His elbow shifts, almost a caress, then moves away, but his knee stays. They sit there in silence, knees touching. Both staring at the ceiling. Robbie wonders what James is thinking, but he feels too shy to ask. Which seems silly, considering what they\u2019ve just done. He shuffles through all the things he could say. Tries to decide whether he should say something wry about what they\u2019ve done. Or maybe he should start a new topic of conversation and ignore what happened. Or say nothing. Reach for the remote and see if there\u2019s anything interesting on the telly. But 'wry' comments are more James\u2019s department, and nothing comes to mind. And the latter choices seem sort of like an elephant-in-the-room thing. He can\u2019t ignore the fact that he just gave his best friend a blowjob. His first one ever. He can\u2019t pretend that he\u2019s ready to stop thinking about the way James\u2019s mouth felt on him. He shivers a little at the memory. At the idea of doing it again. And so the first thing that pops out of his mouth is tinged with admiration and a bit more flippant than he intended. \u201cThat was bloody amazing. Where did you learn to do that?\u201d There\u2019s a slight pause, like James is a bit surprised, too. Like maybe he was expecting something else. \u201cCambridge,\u201d he answers, dry and maybe a bit sarcastic. \u201cWhere did you?\u201d Robbie hesitates, blinded by an image of James\u2014on his knees in a library, shelves of books receding away into the distance, with a cock in his mouth, some faceless young man\u2019s hand splayed across his head. James\u2019s head is bobbing, his cheeks hollowed. His mouth is a breathtaking pink O, moving, sliding\u2026 Because James didn\u2019t learn to do that, that well, without practice, did he? Competing stabs of jealousy and desire spear Robbie\u2019s gut. He has to force the image away so he can concentrate on how he\u2019s going to answer James\u2019s question. Should he give some glib, sarky response in return, or should he tell the truth? If he tells the truth, will it be a big thing? Will James accept it and laugh about it? Regardless, Robbie doesn\u2019t want to lie. He speaks without looking at James. \u201cLearned it from you.\u201d James sits straight up and stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Voice filled with disbelief. \u201cI copied what you did to me. Threw in a bit of me own...innovation, so to speak. And a bit of technique from a girl I knew, back when I was a lad. But, mostly, I just followed your lead.\u201d \u201cAre you telling me...? You don\u2019t mean\u2014! You\u2019ve never...?\u201d Robbie can\u2019t tell which comes closer to making a perfect, shocked \u2018O\u2019 shape, reminiscent of the fantasy image he\u2019s just shaken off, James\u2019s mouth or his bluegreen eyes. Robbie shrugs. \u201cNope. I\u2019d never.\u201d He gives a little half-smile. His face feels hot. He wants to ask how he did. Whether it was good. But that\u2019s just daft vanity, isn\u2019t it, considering the evidence of James\u2019s orgasm. The way James had sounded. \u201cNever done anything with a bloke, have I?\u201d Robbie flushes as he thinks of James\u2019s husky voice, the pressure of James\u2019s hands on his head, the way his body had arched. The heat of him. Robbie touches his tongue to the corner of his mouth before he can stop himself. Remembering the feel of James, coming under his hands, spurting in his mouth. The taste of him. James stares at him, eyes still wide and round, mouth gaped. But his gaze follows the flick of Robbie\u2019s tongue. And his own tongue mirrors it. And Robbie realizes if he wants this to be light and easy, laughable, he needs to take the lead. He needs to set the tone. He bumps James with his knee and gives him a lopsided grin. \u201cBut I\u2019m a fast learner, yeah?\u201d He watches the succession of expressions flit across James\u2019s face. He knows James is running through the options...shock, acceptance, laughter, heat...just like he did, deciding whether to make a big thing of it. Or let it go. And maybe James is remembering how Robbie felt and tasted, too. James gives a little shudder. Then peers at him. Reads him. Like he always does. He flops back down on the couch. \u201cDamn, Robbie. You could\u2019ve just said.\u201d He stares at the ceiling again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d \u201cWanted to,\u201d Robbie admits, some of the heat in his face creeping downward. Curving down his jaw onto his throat. Slipping down until the back of his neck feels flushed. James\u2019s hand slides over. Rests gently on his thigh. His palm is warm. After a minute or so, he clears his throat.  \u201cSo...how was it?\u201d Since truth worked so well before, Robbie says, \u201cSalty. Messy. Kind of slick and disgusting, really. But...exciting.\u201d James gives a quirky little smile and nods without lifting his head. \u201cYeah, I remember that reaction.\u201d \u201cI could get used to it, me,\u201d Robbie admits shyly. James\u2019s fingers tighten on his leg. Squeeze. His palm slides up and down a little. Almost a caress.  \u201cI\u2019d have never guessed you hadn\u2019t done anything before. You seemed so...into it,\u201d he says, teasing and a bit flirtatious. Robbie flushes even hotter, but he can\u2019t deny it. He grins. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine lad to be throwing stones.\u201d And James laughs. Low and throaty. After a couple of minutes of silence, Robbie covers James\u2019s hand with his. James\u2019s hand is cool on top, and his knuckles slowly warm against Robbie\u2019s palm. \u201cSo...\u201d James says thoughtfully, tapping his fingers on Robbie\u2019s thigh, \u201c...maybe there are other things you\u2019d like to learn?\u201d A shivery thrill of sensation tugs at Robbie\u2019s bellybutton. Quivers its way down into his groin. It\u2019s been a long time, years, since he was quick off the block for a second go-round, but that sensation hints that he might respond faster than he usually does. The idea sends a silvery tingle over his skin. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes. \u201cBe a shame to waste all that higher education you\u2019ve accumulated...\u201d James shivers, the sensation passing to Robbie via their hands. James shifts a bit so his shoulder is against Robbie\u2019s. Robbie smiles. Sighs at the warmth flowing off James. At how comforting and familiar it is. James shifts a bit closer. Rests his head on the couch so that his temple is almost touching Robbie\u2019s. They\u2019re silent again for a long while. Robbie thinks back to what started all this, watching the film and their questions afterward, and he chuckles. James turns his face towards him, not lifting his head from the back of the couch. \u201cWhat?\u201d James is so close Robbie can feel warm breath across his cheek. \u201cFriends with benefits,\u201d Robbie says. Laughter threatens to bubble up into his voice. James\u2019s smile is something to behold. A thing of beauty. It crinkles the corners of his eyes and lifts the corners of his normally straight mouth. It lights up his face. It lights up Robbie\u2019s heart. James closes the slight distance between them and touches his mouth to Robbie\u2019s. After what they\u2019ve both just done with their lips, the kiss is surprisingly innocent. Gentle and tender. James shifts, tucking the beer bottle into the cushions of the couch so that it will stay upright, so that his hand is free to cup Robbie\u2019s cheek. To slide up into his hair. James\u2019s hand and the tips of his fingers are cold and damp from the bottle. Robbie mimics him, cupping James\u2019s skull in his palm. Pulling James closer as he kisses him. And kisses him. Lost in the touch and the feel of James\u2019s soft lips moving on his. Roughness of evening beard rasping against his chin. Silky stubble whispering across his palm. The contrasting scent of him, sweet and clean as the air after rain, but with a hint of beer and cigarettes, smoky and dangerous, underneath. Kissing James tenderly is every bit as exciting as taking James\u2019s cock in his mouth and making him moan. It\u2019s different...warm and golden...but just as good. And so sweet. And then James\u2019s tongue swipes across his mouth, teasing him into parting his lips, and the sweetness burns away. Flares up like paper touched by a flame. Ashes whisked away by a swift gust of arousal. Robbie gasps and James\u2019s tongue slips between his lips, touches his tongue. He tastes beer and salt. The musky, salty scent of himself on James\u2019s breath. The sensation is gold shot through with silver.James groans. \u201cGod, Robbie, I can taste myself on your tongue.\u201d They shudder in unison, fingers clenching on each other\u2019s heads. Robbie feels like he\u2019s drowning. Swirling and toppling, end over end. Swept away and struggling with what he feels. Because this isn\u2019t just sex, is it? It\u2019s sex. Oh, it\u2019s definitely sex, but it\u2019s more, too, this whirring and throbbing in his heart. James draws back. Breathing hard. His eyes narrowed and flashing with heat. And something else Robbie can\u2019t read. \u201cWant to take this somewhere more comfortable?\u201d His voice is low and husky, smouldering. Robbie hesitates. Because he wants James, naked and moaning, in his bed. He wants James to teach him all the things he learned at Cambridge. He wants them to learn new things together. But he wants more, and he\u2019s only just realizing it. And this is all moving so fast, there\u2019s no time to adjust. No time to settle the fluttering in his gut. James strokes his neck, fingers lingering over the artery below his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says hesitantly, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Robbie catches his hand. Kisses the calloused tips of James\u2019s fingers. Is rewarded with a flush of satisfaction when James sighs. \u201cNo... I mean, yes. I do want to, me. But...not just that.\u201dJames misunderstands. He tilts his head, nips at Robbie\u2019s jaw. At his lower lip. \u201cWhat then? We can do whatever you want.\u201d And the husky dark promise in his voice takes Robbie\u2019s breath away. The promise of those sharp teeth take his mind away. James plunders his mouth, kissing him and pressing him back into the cushions. Hands roaming down his chest. Back up across his nipples. Teeth worrying at his throat, fingers following behind, soothing the nips and sucking bites, pushing his collar open to expose fresh skin to the edges of teeth. And Robbie groans and tips his head further back. He may have only fooled himself into thinking he was drunk before, but he\u2019s drunk now. Drunk and dizzy with James\u2019s touches and caresses and how thoroughly he seems to know what Robbie wants. He has to shove himself up through the fog of growing arousal. Because this is important. This is more than friends with benefits, and he needs to make sure James understands. That James agrees. He pushes on James shoulders to move him back a bit. To get away from his intoxicating kisses. His dangerous teeth. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d His voice comes out a rasp, and he has to clear his throat. Focus. \u201cMaybe you could spend the night?\u201d James nods. Traces his fingers tracing over Robbie\u2019s lips. Watches his face carefully. \u201cAnd maybe...we could spend the day together? Tomorrow, I mean.\u201d Robbie holds his breath, not sure James will get the reference. It was, after all, just dialogue in a silly film, though it was the part that rang the most true for him. But he doesn\u2019t even know how much attention James was paying. \u201cSaturday?\u201d Robbie nods. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you want to spend Saturday with me?\u201d Robbie nods again, breath still caught in a hard knot in his chest. After a moment, James smiles. It\u2019s like a bright light just came on in the room. Like the sun just crested the horizon. \u201cI\u2019d like to spend Saturday with you, too. All day.\u201d Robbie\u2019s breath releases, and he waits for the cymbal crash of heartbeat, the thundering of pulse that should answer James\u2019s declaration. But what settles over him, through him, is a profound sense of peace. A smooth, warm sense of comfort and quiet. And bubbling underneath, the slow burn of arousal, simmering anticipation for the Friday nights and the Saturdays to come. He smiles and leans towards James for another kiss. ###\n\n"}}, "4640403": {"Chapters:": "1/1", "Words:": "1594", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Jean Innocent"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Mouth to Mouth Resusciation", "Rating:": ["Not Rated"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Jean Innocent"], "Published:": "2015-08-23", "Category:": ["F/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Hits:": "146", "Kudos:": "5", "Summary": "\nA kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.

It\u2019s not that he hated the woman, quite the contrary, if anything he liked her a little too much, certainly more than a Detective Sergeant should for his Chief Super. It had been a little awkward at first, each trying to get use to the others way of working a case. There had been arguments, the occasional hand gesture when the other wasn\u2019t looking but eventually they found one anothers rhythm. Jean had gone out to get them both a coffee when James phone vibrated on his desk, looking at the screen to see Robbie\u2019s name pop up.\n\u201cSir\u2026I wasn\u2019t expecting to hear from you today, shouldn\u2019t you be in bed?\u201d\n\u201cAve done nothing but sleep for the last three days, I wanted to check on you\u2026how are things going with Innocent?\u201d\n\u201cOh you know, well she\u2019s not you Sir.\u201d\n\u201cWell who is, come on lad\u2026you know what I\u2019m getting at here.\u201d Robbie sniffed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been okay, she\u2019s actually pretty good. I don\u2019t know why she spends so much time behind that desk, she should be out there with us\u2026she seems to be enjoying herself.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re coping okay?\u201d\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s not as though I\u2019m going to go telling her am I.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should, come on lad\u2026you\u2019ve had feelings for that woman for long enough, now I don\u2019t claim to understand it myself but you\u2019re both single now and well maybe it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s only been divorced five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cLong enough lad, you\u2019ve been on your own too long and I\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know it\u2019s time I had someone to share my life with.\u201d\n\u201cListen you have the one you want, you just need to tell the lass.\u201d\n\u201cIf I tell her it might mess everything up, our working relationship\u2026she could have me transferred out of here as soon as, if she wanted.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft; Jean Innocent isn\u2019t the type of woman to run away from any problem. She\u2019ll deal with it in a mature fashion and so will you, tell her already\u2026I\u2019m off to bed, try and kill this flu once and for all.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Sir, sleep well.\u201d\nJames hung up when he heard the line go dead; he looked up when a Starbucks appeared in front of him to see Jean smiling down at him.\n\u201cEverything alright Hathaway?\u201d\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, that was DI Lewis on the phone\u2026just checking in.\u201d\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\u201cStill full of the flu, I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be back the rest of the week.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026right then. I hope you don\u2019t mind putting up with me for a little longer then.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all ma\u2019am.\u201d\nJean watched closely as James eyes lingered on her a little longer than expected, a genuine smile on his face.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not much fun working with your Chief Super all day, everyday.\n\u201cNo honestly, it\u2019s been a nice change. It must get boring for you sitting behind a desk all day, mountains of paperwork to get through.\u201d\n\u201cI admit it\u2019s been a rather nice change.\u201d\n\u201cFor both of us.\u201d\nJean felt like her stomach was doing somersaults as James smiled at her once more.\n\u201cRight then, well I suppose we should get back to work.\u201d Jean said, trying to sound professional.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe week was nearly at an end; Robbie was already to return to work. James felt a small tinge of sadness at not working this closely with Jean anymore so he made the most of the time they had left. So many times during the week he\u2019d tried to ask her out, to try and tell her how he felt about her but something or someone always interrupted the moment.\n\u201cI think this is the place.\u201d Jean said as they entered the pub.\nThey had spent the last 24 hours tracking down their suspect who was wanted in connection with the murder of a philosophy student. The small trace of DNA under the young women\u2019s fingernails belonged to Adam Gates who worked as an assistant to Professor Simmons.\n\u201cCan you see him?\u201d Jean asked.\n\u201cWell I\u2026.hang on, over there\u2026end of the bar.\u201d\nJean and James walked over slowly to the man who was completely unaware of their presence, to preoccupied with the beer in his hand.\n\u201cAdam Gates?\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell wants to know?\u201d\n\u201cDS Hathaway and this is Chief Superintendent Innocent.\u201d\n\u201cSuperintendent, wow\u2026think I might join the force if they all look like you.\u201d He sneered as he eyed Jean.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to trace you for the last few days Mr Gates.\u201d\n\u201cBeen busy gorgeous, course if you want to talk to me alone, I\u2019m sure I can find us a quiet little spot that we\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMr Gates, come with us please.\u201d James said, his hand pulling up Gates.\n\u201cWhat the hell, you can\u2019t grab me like that\u2026who the hell do you think you are.\u201d\n\u201cThe police Mr Gates, come on.\u201d\nThey just made it to the door when Gates yanked his arm free, pushing James hard, James falling on the table behind him as Gates rushed out of the pub.\n\u201cJesus, James are you alright.\u201d\n\u201cFine ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m on him.\u201d\nBefore James could say anything Jean was running out the door after Gates, the suspect jumped into his car and started the engine before speeding off, Jean getting in their car and quickly following him at top speed. James saw her drive off as he run outside, worry filling him as his only concern was for her safety. He rushed back inside demanding the owner\u2019s car keys before following Jean and the suspect. He saw their car in front of him, Jean catching up with Gates. Just as they turned the bend in the road, all James could see was Jean\u2019s car going straight on instead of around. His heart thumped loudly as he saw the car driving straight into the water.\n\u201cOh my god\u2026Jean.\u201d\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nJames put his foot down as he drove down the gravel path and came to a halt. He rushed towards the end of the embankment as he saw the car disappearing under water. He quickly removed his jacket and tie and threw off his shoes before diving in to the water. The first thing he felt was the coldness as he dived in, trying hard to keep his eyes open as he swan deeper, he could see the car and Jean struggling to get out. He sawn around to the driver\u2019s side, trying to pull the door open but the suction was just too hard. He watched as Jean tried to breath, and then looked on in horror as she suddenly went limp, her eyes closing. Panic filled him as he swam around looking for something, anything to help open the door. He spotted heavy rocked near the bottom as he went to try and retrieve one. He tried so hard to keep himself focused but it was getting difficult. He was finding it herder to breathe as he grabbed the rock and swam back to Jean. He bashed the rock against the window again and again, taking several blows before the window finally smashed; he moved and positioned himself over Jean as he undid her seatbelt before wrapping his arm around her waist, slowly pulling her out. He held on tightly to her as he got them both to the surface, James gasping for breath when the air finally hit them. He looked at Jean who was still unconscious. He swam quickly to the edge, pulling Jean up and he placed her gently on her back, brushing her hair away from her face.\n\u201cCome on Jean; don\u2019t do this to me\u2026not now.\u201d\nHe leaned over her and began mouth to mouth, breathing in to her mouth before applying compressions to her chest.\n\u201cOne\u2026two\u2026three\u2026four\u2026five, Jean come on, breathe.\u201d\nHe repeated his actions at least six times.\n\u201cOne\u2026.two\u2026three\u2026four\u2026five. Come on Jean, breathe for me. I love you dammit, I\u2019m not losing you now, stay with me.\u201d\nHe did compressions another three times before Jean began to cough, water coming from her mouth. James turned her on her side and she regained her steady breathing. Slowly he helped her sit up, his arm around her shoulder as he held her close to his chest.\n\u201cOh thank god\u2026thank god you\u2019re alright.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026.what happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou nearly died, that\u2019s what happened. Don\u2019t ever scare me like that again.\u201d\nJean pulled back and looked up when the sound of sirens began to approach them, she watched James closely, a small smile on her face.\n\u201cYou saved my life.\u201d\n\u201cJust doing my job ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d\n\u201cYou heard that?\u201d\n\u201cI heard that.\u201d\n\u201cI know this isn\u2019t the right time and we have a killer to catch but I\u2026\u201d\nJames was silenced immediately when Jean wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him close to her as she kissed him.\n\u201cThis is a little bit of a surprise, but a nice surprise. We\u2019ll talk later okay, right now as you said; we have a killer to catch.\u201d\nJames nodded before standing up and helping Jean to her feet, ready to give orders to the approaching uniformed officers.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n-Fin"}}, "4635024": {"Chapters:": "1/1", "Words:": "13118", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Jean Innocent"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Insider Trading", "Rating:": ["Mature"], "Bookmarks:": "1", "Published:": "2015-08-23", "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Categories:": ["F/M", "M/M"], "Kudos:": "29", "Summary": "\nTo get what you want, you have to know what you want.

And for a moment, he and Other James traded places, and Robbie and Other James kissed.And the next night Robbie went to bed with Jean, and he and Actual James never mentioned it again.Except sometimes James wonders if they are talking about it, if they\u2019re talking about it constantly, and if they haven\u2019t stopped talking about it since the night it happened. It\u2019s all in the things they don\u2019t say. It\u2019s in the silence between, \u201cLong day,\u201d and \u201cUp for a pint?\u201d It\u2019s in the way they say, \u201cYou alright?\u201d and they\u2019re not just asking about the miseries of the latest case. It\u2019s even in the way they groan, \u201cFucking Peterson\u2019s nicked our excess budget again,\u201d \u2013 although perhaps then it\u2019s as simple as Peterson being a prick.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in the way James has finally got up the courage to leave more than just a spare toothbrush at Robbie\u2019s, and Robbie\u2019s never said a word about the accruing collection of toiletries, clothes and other personal effects.It\u2019s in the way Robbie sits just a bit closer to him now than he did before, close enough that their shoulders knock together companionably when they laugh, and their knees touch in a way that\u2019s a bit more than companionable.It\u2019s in the little touches that were never there before. The glance of hands against hands, or across backs, or the way Robbie\u2019s taken to brushing his fingers across the back of James\u2019 neck. Robbie has to see what it does to him \u2013 James is goosebumps all over every time \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t stop.It\u2019s in the way some nights James will look up and catch Robbie staring at his lips like they\u2019re the most fascinating thing he\u2019s ever seen.And more than all that, it\u2019s in one very obvious and very much never-talked-about absence. The absence of Jean.All of which, taken together, seem to make up a hundred different daily conversations about the Kiss that Just Happened and seem to suggest that maybe it wasn\u2019t something that Just Happened after all. Maybe it was something that had been happening for awhile, and maybe it\u2019s something that could keep happening if James wants.He definitely wants.Only there\u2019s something he needs to get straightened out first, and damned if he knows how to bring it up. He worries over the problem for days, but in the end it comes out at the most inopportune of moments: over the breakfast table when the coffee is still too hot to drink, and they\u2019re running a sleep debt of at least a hundred hours each, and they\u2019re both shivering because autumn has turned unexpectedly crisp.\u201cHaven\u2019t seen much of Jean lately.\u201dThe remark hangs in the air like a wobbly stalactite. For a moment, James wonders if it\u2019s going to come crashing down and shatter over them both. There\u2019s a lot of fall-out hanging somewhere above all their heads, that\u2019s for sure.But then Robbie looks up over the top of his paper, pins James with an inscrutable look, and says, \u201cGuess not.\u201dImpossible to know what he\u2019s thinking. Impossible to know how he feels about it.James sighs, but silently, and only to himself, because he\u2019s not passive aggressive, no matter what Fiona used to say.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHave you two\u2026\u201d he trails off. Broken up? Called it off? Taken a break? It\u2019s been so long since James was in a situation like this himself (alright, he\u2019s never been in a situation like this) that he doesn\u2019t have the correct vocabulary to hand. Perhaps he should do some research.Robbie shrugs. He looks uncomfortable. And he won\u2019t quite meet James\u2019s eyes, which is a warning sign in and of itself.\u201cWasn\u2019t quite right for her, I think,\u201d Robbie mumbles. He\u2019s still staring at the paper, but his eyes aren\u2019t moving and he hasn\u2019t turned a page in minutes. He\u2019s not reading a word. James resents the petty deception, and he\u2019d like to find a way to force Robbie to look up and look at him and actually talk to him about this mess \u2013 but he\u2019s not sure he has the right to any answers about Jean. Perhaps more to the point, he\u2019s not sure he has the right questions.\u201cNot quite what she wanted,\u201d Robbie clarifies into the silence.James doubts that. He\u2019d seen the way Jean looked at Robbie \u2013 like a spider eying a particularly delicious morsel of embalmed prey \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t think she was anywhere near finished devouring him when she scuttled off to another part of her web.Or to put it in less loaded terms \u2013 because Robbie really wouldn\u2019t like it if he knew James was comparing his (possibly ex?) lover to a black widow \u2013 Jean tended to smile when she looked at Robbie. She doesn\u2019t smile much on any given day, or at anyone really. But she definitely smiled at Robbie. That, more than anything, makes James pretty damn sure it\u2019s nowhere near as simple as her not wanting him.But he knows there was one part of Robbie\u2019s life she didn\u2019t much want, so he says now, \u201cYou mean me. I\u2019m in the way. Fuck, I\u2019m sorry. I can \u2013 I can talk to her, or I can clear off for a bit, or \u2013 \u201dThat makes Robbie look up. The look on his face \u2013 so surprised, so appalled, so simultaneously irritated and fond \u2013 sweeps aside anything James might have been going to say.\u201cHere now,\u201d Robbie says, with surprising firmness. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. I meant \u2013 look lad, we\u2019re just a bit much for her, that\u2019s all.\u201d He pauses and gives James a significant look. \u201cBut that\u2019s how it is, isn\u2019t it? You and me? We\u2019re not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\u201dWe\u2019re. As in, we. As in, us.James thinks he should have quite a lot to say to that, but somehow he can\u2019t seem to push any words at all past the cannon ball lodged in his throat.He understands what Robbie\u2019s getting at, of course. He\u2019s saying that him and James are a partnership already, that Jean has to take them or leave them as they are, and if she\u2019s chosen to leave them \u2013 well, that\u2019s her choice, and there\u2019s not a damn thing either of them can do about it. Which is all well and good and probably even true, but James can\u2019t shake the uncomfortable feeling that Robbie has chosen him over Jean. The thought plants a bezoar of guilt-anxiety deep in the pit of his stomach.He hopes that\u2019s not how it was. He never wanted that. God, he hopes he hadn\u2019t, anyway.Robbie is watching him closely, as if he can read every one of James\u2019s unspoken thoughts. He folds the paper carefully, too carefully, and then reaches across the table, giving James every opportunity to back away. But he doesn\u2019t. He watches Robbie\u2019s fingers as they stretch out and slowly, ever so deliberately, enfold his hand in the gentlest of caresses.It\u2019s the same gesture he made all those months ago at the hospital, and then James took it for what it was: a desperate attempt to hold onto something Robbie thought he was losing, and didn\u2019t know how to keep except by grabbing hold and not letting go. But this time it\u2019s something else entirely. This time, James thinks, it\u2019s a statement of intent.He ought to lodge a protest somewhere. He should say something about compromise and sacrifice and teamwork. He should say something about stepping aside, and doing what\u2019s best for everyone, and not being selfish. But if there\u2019s one thing James has learned about himself in the last few months, it\u2019s that he can be just a little bit selfish sometimes, and while he\u2019s not proud of it, he\u2019s also no longer entirely sure why he shouldn\u2019t be.So he doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead he squeezes Robbie\u2019s hand tight and wonders if there\u2019s some way he can communicate everything he\u2019s thinking through fingerspelling. Perhaps they can both learn braille, since these days they only seem to say anything through touch.And through all the thoughtful hysteria, there\u2019s one sudden, surprise discovery.He\u2019s smiling.There are two constants\u00a0that\u00a0govern\u00a0James Hathaway\u2019s existence: he\u2019s certain of God (hesitantly, unwillingly, he wishes he wasn\u2019t), and he\u2019s certain of Robbie Lewis.The first constant has been tested over and over again, shaken and finally found stronger for the doubting.He\u2019s never had cause to doubt the second. Not until now.But ever since the morning Robbie walked into their office with everything he and Jean had been up to the night before painted baldly across his face, there hasn\u2019t been one waking moment where James has felt on solid ground. Everything has had to be re-evaluated: Robbie\u2019s dead-end flirtation with Laura Hobson, his grief for his wife, his absolute principled adherence to the Right Thing, and more than all that his presence as the one constant in James\u2019 life.All the given values of Robbie Lewis have become variables. Not that Robbie is an equation, even if sometimes James thinks relationships are like geometry (too many angles, and constantly changing shapes). Maybe they\u2019re like Venn Diagrams \u2013 it\u2019s as good a way as any to think about all the places people intersect and all the places they\u2019re unknowable.\u00a0 But James has never been much good at maths. Certainly in all his calculations, he never anticipated Jean Innocent. And since she came into the equation,\u00a0everything is unstable, everything is reforming, and all he\u2019s learned is that he can\u2019t imagine any diagram of his life that doesn\u2019t have Robbie Lewis at the centre of it.Most days he\u2019s reasonably sure Robbie feels the same.That's the kind of certainty that takes a beating\u00a0when he overhears the latest bit of break room banter.\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon\u2019s going on? She\u2019s been a right cow all week.\u201d\u201cAsk Lewis,\u201d someone says, and there\u2019s cat-calls and general laughter. James steps closer, drawn almost against his will by the sound of Lewis\u2019s name.\u201cDidn\u2019t waste much time, did he. The ink can\u2019t have been dry on her divorce papers.\u201d\u201cIf that. Bet he was in there before.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t blame the bloke, though, can you. Woman like that!\u201d\u201cReckon she gives the orders in the bedroom?\u201d\u201cChrist, don\u2019t go there, mate! That\u2019s our CS!\u201d\u201cYeah, all right, keep your shirt on. I\u2019m just saying I bet they\u2019re kinky old sods.\u201dHe\u2019s heard enough. James steps forward and the room falls silent so fast it\u2019s like someone\u2019s flicked the off switch. James doesn\u2019t know what kind of expression is on his face but it must be something awful, because Sergeant Crouch looks like he\u2019s about to piss himself. Later James will take some grim satisfaction in that.Now, unexpectedly, it\u2019s another voice that comes to the rescue. \u201cLeave off, chaps. Don\u2019t you all have work to do? And Abrams \u2013 Peterson\u2019s looking for you.\u201dIt\u2019s PC Howe, who\u2019s appeared like a miracle somewhere behind James\u2019 left shoulder, face hard and eyes glittering like an angel of vengeance. He\u2019s only a constable, but his voice shimmers with the authority of Innocent herself and the crowd of gossiping officers disperses so fast you\u2019d think someone had sprayed tear gas into their midst.Involuntarily James remembers the night he turned up at the station with that bugger of a suspect who turned out to have killed Abbot and the rest. He\u2019d been bleeding above his eye, and worn thin from weeks of existing on nothing but caffeine and nicotine, and thinking more about Robbie than about the bloody serial killer he had in cuffs. He must have looked a fright. But Howe had said nothing. He\u2019d booked the bastard, and caught James when he fell, and somehow even managed to bully him into an ambulance.Howe had been there, too, when Robbie and Jean had showed up at the hospital together. Now James narrows his eyes, and wonders if Howe\u2019s little act is really guilt for letting slip a few details he shouldn\u2019t. But Howe looks at him, blinks, and his eyes are wide and clear as a freshwater stream.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word.\u201dAnd he gives James a look so frankly knowing his insides run cold. James isn\u2019t capable of putting together anything like a reasonable response right now. So he just nods, once, in thanks. Howe seems to get it all the same.\u201cUseless sods,\u201d Howe continues cheerfully, flicking his eyes expressively after Hooper and the rest. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d have something better to do with their time.\u201dJames doesn\u2019t make friends easily \u2013 honestly, sometimes he thinks Lewis is the only officer on the force who doesn\u2019t call him a stuck-up knob behind his back \u2013 but he takes a second look at Peter Howe right now and decides he quite likes what he sees.\u201cThanks, Constable,\u201d he says, and makes a note of who to bring on next time they need manpower on a complicated case. Something juicy. Something that might give Howe a leg-up next time there\u2019s a vacancy for someone to make it out of uniform.\u201cNo one\u2019s business what happens outside the nick, is it,\u201d Howe says, and gives James just the smallest of smiles.Perhaps not. Particularly when it\u2019s not happening anymore.James wonders for all of about half a second if he should tell Robbie that his little affair (if not its conclusion) is common knowledge around the nick. Someone really ought to tell Jean, although James certainly isn\u2019t putting his hand up for that task. Their CS has never really appreciated the principle of not shooting the messenger.\u00a0\u00a0But he tries to think of any way of framing that conversation that won\u2019t led to him being shot down in flames, and his mind comes up blank. Anyway, it\u2019s over now, isn\u2019t it. The gossip will die down when there\u2019s nothing to feed it.Except there is, of course. There\u2019s budget meetings, and staff assignments, and all the hundreds of daily interactions between the three of them that James had barely noticed until they became an exercise in government-approved torture.\u201cAny update on the strangler?\u201d Jean asks at the close of a personnel review that he shouldn\u2019t even have attended \u2013 sergeants aren\u2019t required, but he knows why Jean requested his presence. She doesn\u2019t want to be alone with Robbie and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine, except for all the ways that it\u2019s really not. Actually, James thinks it\u2019s fucked up that she\u2019d rather deal with the two of them than with Robbie alone. He doesn\u2019t like to speculate on what she must think of him \u2013 doubtless it\u2019s not at all complimentary \u2013 but he thinks it\u2019s a bloody good thing he has no interest in promotion because there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019ll ever put him forward for it now.Robbie doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s like he hasn\u2019t even heard her. Robbie\u2019s been distracted all week \u2013 a right mess around Jean, not that James can blame him \u2013 and it\u2019s left to James to say,\u201cFourth victim this morning, Ma\u2019am, and no connection to the other two as far as we can see. We\u2019re waiting on the autopsy report.\u201dShe frowns, blinks, focuses her eyes on him and says, \u201cSorry?\u201dShe hasn\u2019t heard him either.James bites his lip and wonders if they should take themselves off this case. None of them are concentrating, and that\u2019s bad enough in the normal way of things, but there are quite literally lives on the line here. Their second serial killer this year, and that\u2019s two too many. They all need to be at their sharpest, and right now none of them have been less clear-headed.It\u2019s another reason coppers shouldn\u2019t get involved, he supposes. There\u2019s no such thing as a low stakes affair.He repeats himself dutifully and she nods, looking like it takes real effort to concentrate. James can\u2019t help but think how tired she looks. Her eyes are shadowed and as bloodshot as they were in the week she and Andrew filed for divorce. It\u2019s particularly noticeable now because she\u2019s been looking so much more cheerful in recent months.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d she says. \u201cKeep me updated.\u201dJames looks between Jean\u2019s pinched, miserable face and Robbie\u2019s frowning eyes and thinks, with just a hint of self-pity, guess that\u2019s my job.But despite the gossip and the tension and the heavy certainty that at least some of this mess is his fault,\u00a0James is happier than he can ever remember being.\u00a0It\u2019s no new discovery that guilt and happiness can co-exist, if not peacefully, then remarkably easily. Guilt is a near constant of James\u2019 existence, and he has precious few happy memories that aren\u2019t spiked with it. Perhaps that\u2019s why even when James is happy \u2013 truly, deeply, tail-curlingly happy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t much show. That\u2019s how he knows this kind of guilty happiness is something different from anything he\u2019s ever experienced before. Sometimes he\u2019ll be doing data entry, or totalling expenses \u2013 the interminable grind of the job that he resents almost as much as the constant assault of human misery \u2013 and he\u2019ll catch his lips curving into a hesitant this-can\u2019t-be-happening-to-me smile.On the surface, little about his life has changed. He and Robbie got to work, and they come home, and they still talk about the job and don\u2019t talk about what they\u2019re doing. The only noticeable difference is that now James crashes out in the bed instead of on the couch. It\u2019s a lot easier on his back \u2013 so much easier that it damn near compensates for the awkwardness of lying where his CS had lain just a few weeks before. At first James thinks the pillows still smell like her. He brings his own laundry detergent round to Robbie\u2019s flat and runs the linens through the washer twice.But if everything looks like business-as-usual, underneath there\u2019s a subtle revolution taking place inside them both. James can see it every day in the way Robbie looks at him and talks to him, the way he feels calmer and more at peace as the days go on, the way Robbie says, \u201cwould you pass us the stapler, pet?\u201d and then looks a bit self-conscious about the endearment. James doesn\u2019t mind. He doesn\u2019t mind it at all, even if they probably should be a bit more circumspect around the nick.\u00a0\u00a0They sleep together, but they don\u2019t sleep together.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s so chaste James sometimes wonders if he\u2019s completely misread the situation, but just when he\u2019s starting to wonder \u2013 starting to doubt \u2013 because it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s added up two and two and got seventeen \u2013 he\u2019ll catch Robbie gazing at his lips. Studying them. Studying all of him. And the look on his face is anything but platonic.The ball is in James\u2019 court. That\u2019s clear. Robbie has kissed him, and held his hand, and somehow in the silence promises were exchanged and commitments were made. There are expectations now, and it\u2019s up to James to make the next move.He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s holding him back, except maybe the way every day he has to watch Robbie and their CS do their damn best to look anywhere but at each other. They\u2019re polite \u2013 so polite it sets James\u2019 teeth on edge \u2013 but Jean\u2019s eyes are hooded and she\u2019s screaming hell with the rank and file. As for Robbie \u2013 well, Robbie\u2019s the same gentle man he always is. But sometimes James looks at his partner and thinks his eyes are crinkled with a sorrow that wasn\u2019t there before. He\u2019s a bit quieter, now. A bit older. And sometimes Jean will walk past their office and Robbie will look up from his desk, his eyes following her every step, and for a moment the look on his face will be almost wistful.So while in the night James curls himself contentedly around Robbie\u2019s solid warmth, during the day he continues to wonder if he should take himself out of this situation, or even if he can. They tried that already, didn\u2019t they, and it ended up with James in hospital and Robbie white-faced and shaking and a serial killer nearly gone free. James would really rather not repeat the experiment.This is the solution all their agonising has come to. James and Robbie, partners in and out of the nick, and the pair of them reporting to CS Innocent. They\u2019re back where they started, really, and it\u2019s not at all how James expected this whole mess to end. It would all be perfect, if not for the secret suspicion that maybe this is what a selfish part of him was aiming at all along.He\u2019s not sure it\u2019s worked out quite the way he wanted.The latest budget review \u2013 long, interminable meeting where Peterson peacocks and Grainger mumbles excuses and Jean manages everything with a quiet efficiency that James can\u2019t help but admire \u2013 is drawing to a close when DI Laxton pipes up to say,\u201cCan anyone spare a constable or two? I\u2019ve got a lead on the drug dealing up at Headington Girls. I could use a few extra bodies this week.\u201dThere\u2019s an awkward silence as the collected DIs look anywhere but at each other.\u00a0\u00a0 No one is prepared to give up one of their team.\u201cHow about DC Lockhart?\u201d Jean suggests into the hostile silence. \u201cYou can spare her, can\u2019t you, Robbie?\u201dNo, they bloody well can\u2019t. She knows it, too. They\u2019re on the strangler case \u2013 four dead and no leads and the media breathing down their necks. No one else in the nick would touch this case with a ten-foot pole. They need every available body they can get, and since when did teenage coke habits take priority over murder?\u201cOf course, Ma\u2019am,\u201d Robbie murmurs deferentially, and steps heavily on James\u2019 toe when he draws a sharp, indignant breath. \u201cI\u2019ll send her your way this afternoon, Helen.\u201dJames opens his mouth to protest, because someone has to be doing what\u2019s best for the case here, even if Robbie and Jean are too busy playing chicken with each other to care. But then he catches sight of Innocent\u2019s face. She\u2019s frowning.This isn\u2019t what she wanted, he realises. She wanted Robbie to fight. She wanted him to argue back, so she could insist, so she could revel in the bloodlust of battle and the joy of victory. She wanted to humiliate him publicly the way she feels he humiliated her at home.Or perhaps (although James thinks this is statistically less likely), she wanted him to protest so that she could play the understanding boss, give a performance of magnanimity and offer indisputable proof of her own unshakeable professionalism.Whatever game she\u2019s playing, she\u2019s lost, and she\u2019s not happy about it. She dismisses them all with a slam of her book on the table.\u201cSorry, Robbie,\u201d Laxton murmurs afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to take one of yours. I know you\u2019re on a bastard of a case at the moment.\u201dRobbie shrugs.\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any leads anyway. It\u2019ll just be a few extra late nights for us, won\u2019t it, Hathaway?\u201dJames does his very best not to scowl and doesn\u2019t quite manage it. He thinks that whatever game this is, right now they\u2019re all playing to lose.Robbie is quiet that night. Quieter than usual, that is. He\u2019s never been much of a talker, really, but lately the silences between them hang so heavy it makes James want to scream.It was never this quiet when Jean was around, James remembers in spite of himself. She seemed to fill all the cracks between them with mindless chatter that was irritating, but he sees now served an important purpose all of its own. It distracted attention away from all the things none of them were prepared to say.The thing is, James is usually the one who gets stuck in his head. Robbie knows how to deal with him when he\u2019s like that, but Robbie gets himself into a state like this so rarely that James has no idea how to return the favour.Jean would know, James thinks with a pang. For a moment \u2013 just a moment, mind \u2013 he almost wishes her back.But she\u2019s not back, and it\u2019s down to him, and he and Robbie have always communicated better in the spaces between words. So he doesn\u2019t try her trick of brow-beating him into compliance. Instead he says, \u201cCome to bed?\u201dAnd Robbie looks up, hearing something new in the tentative enquiry.He nods and stands up, and James takes all his courage in his hands, steps close and kisses him.It\u2019s awkward at first \u2013 he\u2019s taken Robbie by surprise, that\u2019s clear, and they knock noses and teeth, and Robbie clearly isn\u2019t used to kissing someone taller than him \u2013 but then James turns his head and Robbie clasps his neck and suddenly it\u2019s so, so good.Afterwards, when they\u2019re lying in bed still fully clothed, because Robbie said \u201cI think that\u2019s enough to be getting on with for now, lad,\u201d and James quite agrees, Robbie says, \u201cGet what you were aiming at, then?\u201dHe knows, then. He knows James was worrying about him, and had feared that this new thing between them was so fragile it might break if he didn\u2019t reach out and try to make it stronger, and that James had felt scared and helpless and hadn\u2019t known what else to try. Of course he does. Doubtless it was that same desperate impulse that first led Robbie to thrust their lips together all those weeks ago.But there\u2019s more in the question than just a kiss, and James frowns to himself, says, \u201cMaybe. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dRobbie and Jean take to avoiding each other entirely. James would say they were both behaving like children, if it wasn\u2019t obvious that what\u2019s going on is anything but childish. When they have to interact, they studiously avoid looking at each other, as if no one will notice the misery on either of their faces if they don\u2019t make eye contact.Which is how James finds himself delivering the latest expense report at the end of the month. Bloody stupid, really, the way they still do these in hard copy. If they\u2019d gone completely electronic, he and Jean wouldn\u2019t be standing here now blinking at each other in awkward silence.God, what do you even say, when you\u2019re looking at the woman who was your lover\u2019s lover until a month ago?\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I wanted,\u201d he tells her quietly.She gives him a look like he\u2019s being absolutely bleeding daft and he\u2019s damn lucky he\u2019s got a job in Oxford because no other CS in the country would put up with him.\u201cI know that.\u201dIt\u2019s evident she does, too. She seems to know that with more certainty than he does. James stares at her, stumped. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say.\u201cGive me an update on the strangler,\u201d she says. He looks at her and tries to convey how sorry he is and how messed up it all is and how much he wishes they could all go back to the way things were before. Though which before he doesn\u2019t even know. Before James-and-Robbie? Before Robbie-and-Jean? He can\u2019t wish her back in a miserable, loveless marriage, nor can he wish himself out of Robbie\u2019s arms.But her eyes are hard and impassive and James can\u2019t find any hint in there of the giggling woman with the sad eyes with whom he spent weeks and weeks co-existing in wary neutrality. She\u2019s all Superintendent Innocent, here; Jean isn\u2019t anywhere in sight.So, \u201cAnother body at Carlisle College,\u201d he tells her. \u201cRobbie\u2019s at the autopsy now. Looks to be the same as the others.\u201dShe nods, and says, \u201cAlright, well, keep me updated. Press conference at 4.\u201dIt\u2019s a clear dismissal. He can\u2019t ignore an order from a senior officer, even if just once he would really, really like to. There\u2019s a lot they need to say, he thinks. And though lord knows none of them are much with words, he thinks he and Jean might be able to take a crack at smoothing this over if they can just sit down and hash it out between them without Robbie\u2019s well-meaning if inarticulate interference.But she\u2019s staring at him with a blankness he thinks a bloody iceberg would envy and he\u2019s got no choice.\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he says, and for the first time ever that sounds more wrong than \u2018Jean\u2019.\u00a0The press conference is a disaster. Robbie\u2019s usually a pro at these \u2013 his wry sense of humour goes down a treat with the hordes who have a vicious interest in true crime, his rough Northern firmness warns the vultures away if they get too close to something sensitive, and Robbie and that bloke from the Oxford Times get on like a house on fire so the paper is usually amenable to slipping in the bits the police want the public to know.But this one is a mess from start to finish. Robbie is doing just fine for all of two minutes, and then Jean slips through the door at the back. Instantly he\u2019s distracted \u2013 obviously distracted \u2013 and his usual good humour is nowhere in sight. He reports the details of the latest death with a grimness that puts everyone on edge, and he doesn\u2019t even bother pretending to\u00a0address the questions that police procedure forbids him from answering. His evasions are bleedingly obvious, and it couldn\u2019t be clearer that they don\u2019t have a single buggering clue to go on.5 dead and the police are all at sea. That\u2019s the definition of bad press.Robbie doesn\u2019t even seem to notice how badly he\u2019s handling it, and that\u2019s a whole other worry in and of itself. Afterwards, James just has time to murmur, \u201cUmm\u2026not ideal, sir,\u201d before Jean is on them like the fiercest of the Furies.Not Jean, James reminds himself irritably. CS Innocent. Their Super. Even Ma\u2019am would be better. She\u2019s not Jean anymore \u2013 wasn\u2019t ever Jean to him \u2013 and he can\u2019t think why his mind is insisting on intimacy now when any intimacy, real or feigned, is over.\u201cWhat in the bleeding heck was that, Lewis?\u201d she demands. \u201cAre you trying to get the press offside?\u201dA small fleck of spittle bubbles up around the corner of her lips. James is curiously fascinated by it. Although maybe that\u2019s just because it\u2019s easier to look at her lips \u2013 pulled taught in the thinnest line he\u2019s ever seen \u2013 that to meet her eyes, all blood-shot whites and blue-ringed in a way that fairly trumpets unhappiness.\u201cSorry?\u201d Robbie blinks and stares at her in confusion.Wrong response.\u201cThat little performance of incompetence,\u201d she spits. \u201cI\u2019m asking for an explanation.\u201dRobbie flushes, a slow deep scarlet that spreads up from his collar to his cheeks all the way to his hairline. It\u2019s painful to watch.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult case, Ma\u2019am,\u201d James offers diffidently.She flashes him a look that contains knives.Right. He\u2019s to keep out of this one, then.The tongue-lashing goes on and on until the DCs in the corner are actually wincing. Robbie just stands there and takes it, looking as if he\u2019s carved out of stone, and his non-reaction seems to enflame her more than anything he might say in response.\u201c\u2026you just have to bloody well do things your way, don\u2019t you, Robbie, and who cares about procedure or working with a goddamn team \u2013 it\u2019s all unilateral decisions and you and James acting like a bloody unit of one as if there isn\u2019t \u2013 \u201d\u201cYou\u2019d know something about unilateral decisions,\u201d Robbie interrupts, his voice very quiet and pointed sharp as a dagger. \u201cMe and James, we\u2019re partners, but it\u2019s not a closed circuit.\u201dShe goes white then red so fast it\u2019s like someone\u2019s wiped a paint brush across her face. For a moment they just stare at each other, then,\u201cYou\u2019re off this case,\u201d she tells them. \u201cBoth of you,\u201d and she whirls away, frustrated anger in everything from the frizz of her hair to the tap of her heels.More than anger, James thinks. Misery.\u00a0\u201cI hear the super gave you two a right roasting,\u201d Laura says off-hand when he arrives at the scene.James freezes, bites his lip and looks around nervously. Robbie\u2019s out of earshot, thank God.\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, and lets out a long sigh. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d At least he doesn\u2019t have to pretend with Laura, or at least not much.\u201cRumour is love\u2019s tender dream has gone sour,\u201d she continues, her voice casual and her eyes anything but. She\u2019s watching him closely. Too closely. \u201cYou know anything about that?\u201dHe swallows.\u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dShe just looks at him. She knows. He knows that she knows. She knows that he knows that she knows.It\u2019s enough to make his head spin.He wonders for a moment how she feels about all this. It\u2019s been obvious for years that she holds a torch for Robbie Lewis, and until a few months ago James would have sworn Robbie felt the same. Actually, he thinks part of Robbie might still feel the same, and that this might all be nothing more than a speed bump on the road towards the inevitable Lewis-Hobson nuptials. Although adding a fourth person into this mix seems like a recipe for true limb-exploding, eyeball-popping disaster. It\u2019s already too combustible.And the thing about Laura \u2013 the thing that\u2019s probably saved her from getting dragged down into this mess with the rest of them \u2013 is that she doesn\u2019t need anyone. She wants someone in her life, James doesn\u2019t doubt it, and she might even want Robbie, but she doesn\u2019t have that all-consuming, soul-destroying, self-destructive need that seems to drive both him and Jean headlong towards the things that are worst for them. She\u2019s not even like Robbie, bless him, who needs to be needed and so somehow has found himself giving and giving to two lost souls who\u2019ve never learned to disentangle love from respect, friendship from desire.Perhaps it\u2019s not so surprising things have turned out the way they have. Perhaps they\u2019re all doomed to wanting and needing too many things, and having to settle for either what they want or what they need but never both at once.He can\u2019t say any of that to Laura. So instead he tells her, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to deal with Peterson from now on. She\u2019s taken us off the Strangler case.\u201dAnd those laser blue eyes \u2013 the eyes that see much more than they should, and have the power to strip you bare with a glance \u2013 soften slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s the right choice,\u201d she says quietly, and he knows she\u2019s not talking about the duty roster. Both their eyes drift towards Robbie, who\u2019s treating the nearest DC to a positively vile tongue-lashing. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way.\u201dBut long after Laura has gone back to examining the body, James continues to watch his boss. Robbie is hectoring the crowd of DCs in a way he\u2019d lay into another DI for doing, and his shoulders are hunched, and his eyes just a bit sadder than they used to be. James suspects that maybe this time Laura isn\u2019t seeing things quite clearly, for all her twenty-twenty vision. Because it may have been the right decision, but James finds it pretty hard to believe that anything is better than it was before.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that everything seems to change pace after that.It\u2019s suddenly no secret round the nick that the Lewis-Innocent romance has gone sour, and the whole force are buckling beneath the weight of Innocent\u2019s unreasonable, ireful demands. James doesn\u2019t know if the knowing smirks or the resentful glares are more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 At least Robbie is so preoccupied he doesn\u2019t notice.It\u2019s James who ends up endlessly rising to the bait. PC Howe isn\u2019t always on hand to dispel a tense situation, and James\u2019 too-sharp tongue kills off rumours \u2013 in his hearing at least \u2013 but at the cost of at least two DCs who now refuse to work with him, and a handful of others who go white when he approaches. Robbie doesn\u2019t notice that either, or if he does, he says nothing.\u201cYou could probably ease up, Sarge,\u201d Julie tells him quietly one day after he\u2019s taken care to precisely articulate to Sergeant Crouch all the reasons why he is defective not merely as a police officer, but as a man. \u201cThey don\u2019t mean any harm. It\u2019s not like anyone respects Lewis or Innocent the less for it.\u201dShe gives him an uncertain look, and James sees it then \u2013 the \u2018why do you care?\u2019 in her eyes. Everyone\u2019s probably wondering that. James doesn\u2019t have an answer for them. Feeling protective of Robbie is nothing new, and doubtless only to be expected with the way things are between them now, but he feels strangely protective of Jean too, and there\u2019s no logical reason for that at all.\u201cIt\u2019s unprofessional,\u201d he tells her shortly.She gives him a look, as if to say that what Robbie and Jean had been up to was mighty unprofessional, and the way they\u2019re handling it now isn\u2019t exactly proper, either. He scowls and does his absolute best not to think about the kinds of things that will be said if anyone ever discovers the part he\u2019s played and continues to play in this mess. He\u2019s not entirely successful. \u00a0\u00a0And while they\u2019re fighting battles in and out of the nick, there are more subtle negotiations going on at home. James knows that when things started up between Robbie and Jean, the pair of them fell into bed with nary a thought for tomorrow or all the days afterwards. There was no discussion of the future, no discussion of consequences, and now all three of them are paying for it.But perhaps Robbie has learned caution, because things with James are advancing along quite a different road. Everything is slow and precise \u2013 no words spoken, but every act laden with weight and care. Cleared out drawers and hanging space, Robbie\u2019s switch from buying a half to a full pint of milk, even the way he sets his alarm early on a Sunday morning and doesn\u2019t grumble when James slides out of bed early for mass, all these things say, you have a place in my life, this is not temporary.\u00a0 This is not news to James, who never for one moment thought this thing they were or weren\u2019t doing was casual. But the little acts touch something deep inside him all the same. He feels calmer than he ever did, more at peace with the world and with himself.This kind of careful, meaningful non-conversation sets the pace in everything. So hand-holding has given way to kissing, which has slowly evolved into necking on the sofa, which has become hands fumbling with buttons to caress naked skin. They\u2019re taking it slow as teenagers on the verge of new discovery, and sometimes that\u2019s how it feels to James \u2013 like he\u2019s discovering sex for the very first time. It\u2019s certainly unbeaten ground for both of them, and James remembers all too well that late night conversation when Robbie had said, I\u2019m not sure I can be the way you need.\u00a0 He\u2019s been trying to be ever since. This both touches and terrifies James, who is only too aware\u00a0that there are conversations they really need to be having and things that can\u2019t be communicated through touch alone. Conversations about boundaries and limits, likes and dislikes, even (though please God no) past experiences.James is only too aware that Robbie is trying to give him everything he thinks James needs, which is what makes this whole situation so beautifully ironic. Because that night, James had said this is what I need, meaning closeness and affection and partnership, but not sex. Never sex. And when Robbie had pressed him, he\u2019d said, I wouldn\u2019t say no, because it was easy to be glib when anything more wasn\u2019t on the table. It\u2019s hard to know what to say now it seems like something more might be.\u00a0 He needs Robbie to understand that it isn\u2019t necessary \u2013 not in the way that just being together, and knowing absolutely and without doubt the centrality of his own place in Robbie\u2019s life is necessary \u2013 and that neither of them have to want or need anything more than what they have.But when the conversation finally comes up \u2013 when touch finally gives way to words \u2013 that\u2019s not exactly how it plays out.The latest let\u2019s-unearth-a-star reality show is tinkling in the background. Neither James nor Robbie are watching it. Who really watches pre-pubescents trying to land a recording deal when there\u2019s a warm body and gentle kisses within easy reach? So while some child who sounds like Mariah Carey and looks like a Velazquez painting shrieks onscreen, they fall into a slow and languorous exploration of each other \u2013 long, wet kisses and the laving of tongues feeling out the intricacies of each others\u2019 mouths. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve fallen from a long day into a long embrace, but it feels different tonight. More intimate. More expectant.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Robbie says, and trails off without ever telling James what he is. The gentle nip of his teeth at James\u2019 collarbone says everything.\u201cSo\u2019re you,\u201d James murmurs and presses his lips to that pulsating vein in Robbie\u2019s throat.He lets himself be dragged along by the current of desire, and it\u2019s so powerful he doesn\u2019t even notice how far he is from shore until Robbie\u2019s fingers are no longer playing his nipples or splayed across his belly. Hands on bare skin have become hands on his jeans, fingers reaching for his fly. Robbie\u2019s teeth nick James\u2019 bottom lip. Gentle kisses have turned into something hot and fast and needy and Robbie\u2019s hands are greedy, laying claim to every part of him. And it\u2019s too much, too much, and James both wants to press so close they\u2019re one skin and scramble away so far and so fast there\u2019s all the deserts in Africa between them.\u201cOh God, Robbie, stop. Sorry, we have to stop.\u201dHe does, of course. He pulls back so fast it\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t get whiplash. He lifts his hands from James\u2019 body and they hover in the air uncertainly for a moment, before coming to rest ever so hesitantly on James\u2019 knees.\u201cYou alright?\u201d Robbie says after a moment. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to push you.\u201dJames closes his eyes. It\u2019s now or never, isn\u2019t it. They can go on \u2013 he can reach out to draw Robbie close again and lose himself in momentary immolation and hope that while they\u2019re pressing closer, another part of one or both of them isn\u2019t retreating faster than the march of the Ten Thousand \u2013 or he can try to initiate a conversation about this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looks at Robbie\u2019s crinkled blue eyes and quietly concerned expression and knows he doesn\u2019t have a choice. There are things that have to be said. It\u2019s so important Robbie understands that sex isn\u2019t what he\u2019s looking for here. It\u2019s never what he\u2019s looking for.\u00a0\u00a0But that\u2019s not how it comes out. Instead, he opens his mouth and what comes out is, \u201cI don\u2019t much like sex.\u201dFuck. His stupid mouth insists on going on auto-pilot at the worst of all possible times.\u201cNever have,\u201d he continues,\u00a0as if\u00a0his brain has decided that now he\u2019s put his foot in it, he may as well tread so thoroughly in the mess that everything is soiled.Robbie\u2019s gobsmacked expression is so comical James feels the sudden, unexpected, urge to laugh. He probably would indulge in a giggle if it wasn\u2019t all so damn important.Well, now that he\u2019s started on this road to Tartarus, he may as well see it through to its miserable conclusion. Even though he\u2019s had this conversation at least a dozen times before and no one ever understands.\u00a0 They should have talked about this earlier; they should have talked about a lot of things earlier.\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t mind it,\u201d he says, because if it\u2019s important that Robbie understand it\u2019s not necessary for him \u2013 never has been \u2013 it\u2019s equally important Robbie understand that he\u2019s not saying no. \u201cSometimes I even quite enjoy it. But usually, um, well, I\u2019m not often in the mood.\u201dRobbie looks at him very seriously, and doesn\u2019t say anything. And although the silence makes him uncomfortable, James is also curiously grateful for it, because it\u2019s so much better than most people\u2019s reactions \u2013 horror, or pity, or you\u2019ll like it with me. Better even than the silence is the way Robbie doesn\u2019t try to disentangle himself from James. It\u2019s as if he understands instinctively, without words, that just because James isn\u2019t always sure about sex doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t want kisses and embraces and all the other bi-products of affection.\u201cBut there\u2019ve been people, haven\u2019t there? I thought you had someone a couple of months ago,\u201d Robbie says finally, not disbelieving, or accusing, just sort of interested.James colours, and regrets that stupid fling with Robyn from accounting more than ever.Robyn, with her long chestnut mane and her huge blue eyes that would have reminded him of Robbie\u2019s if they\u2019d glinted with even an ounce of Robbie\u2019s intelligence. Robyn, with the name and the eyes that were almost right, but instead were unbearable in all the ways they were wrong.James shrugs. \u201cIt was an experiment,\u201d he says shortly. He\u2019s not going to say more \u2013 he\u2019s not the sort who kisses and tells \u2013 and Robyn deserves better than that, anyway. He feels bad enough as it is about using her in an attempt to even the scales, to create another point in that terrible triangle they\u2019d lived in for weeks. A doomed attempt, as it turned out.\u201cAlright,\u201d Robbie says evenly, and because his eyes aren\u2019t really like Robyn\u2019s at all, they seem to see everything James is and isn\u2019t saying. He\u2019s always been too bloody sharp for his own good.\u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in sex,\u201d Robbie says, then, \u201cwith me,\u201d he clarifies, as if that needs clarification.James wonders if he\u2019s imagining it, or if Robbie looks just the tiniest bit disappointed.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be interested,\u201d he says, stung.He really hadn\u2019t, either, not until recently. Looking back he sees where all the escalating kisses and touches have been leading. Robbie\u2019s been girding himself for this, quietly testing himself, seeing what he can and can\u2019t give, so that when they got to this point Robbie would be sure he could say yes completely and wholeheartedly. He hasn\u2019t wanted to embarrass James by rejecting him in the middle of the act.Instead it\u2019s James who\u2019s rejecting him. James, who hasn\u2019t given this half the thought Robbie has, even though it must matter to him at least four times as much. He knows he\u2019s an awkward sod at the best of times, but Christ, sometimes he can be a thoughtless prat too.Robbie shifts awkwardly and doesn\u2019t look at him as he says, \u201cyeah, well, didn\u2019t think it was on offer, until recently.\u201d Then his eyes widen, as if he\u2019s appalled by what he\u2019s just said. \u201cNot that I mean it is now,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not saying that \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to assume \u2013 and we\u2019re okay as we are, you know \u2013 we can go on \u2013 or \u2013\u201d he breaks off, frowns to himself, and it would be bloody adorable if it didn\u2019t matter so goddamn much.\u201cSorry,\u201d Robbie says finally, when he\u2019s got himself a bit more together. \u201cI\u2019m making a right old mess of this. Look, the last thing I want to do is pressure you. I\u2019m happy with us just the way we are.\u201dAnd now James really can\u2019t help laughing. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s so sweet, it\u2019s so absolutely, completely, 100% Robbie, and James wonders for a moment why he\u2019d ever worried this man might react any differently.\u201cIt\u2019s on offer,\u201d James tells him seriously when he\u2019s got his fit of nervous giggles under control. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on offer.\u201dRobbie regards him uncertainly, hesitation in every line of his body. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want.\u201dJames suspects that saying something like, I want to make you happy, would be entirely the wrong response here and might result in Robbie not coming anywhere near his bed ever. So instead he says, \u201cI know,\u201d which he does, and \u201cI want to,\u201d which is probably true.Then, and because they say all good relationships are founded on honesty, \u201cAlthough in the interests of full disclosure, you should know I\u2019ve never done this before. With a bloke, I mean. So honestly I\u2019m not sure whether\u2026\u201d he trails off. He doesn\u2019t need to say anymore; that\u2019s enough, more than enough, surely.Robbie\u2019s eyes widen infinitesimally. Interesting. So he hadn\u2019t expected that. But then he shakes his head, taking it in his stride as easily as he\u2019s taken everything else James has thrown his way over the last few months.\u201cWell, me neither,\u201d he says easily. \u201cBut I reckon we can figure it out.\u201dThey can, and they do, and after the first few awkward encounters \u2013 all fumbling fingers and no one quite sure where to put their knees \u2013 James decides that not minding sex has become quite liking sex. Sometimes. With Robbie. Not all the time, but now and then \u2013 well, actually, now and then it\u2019s bloody brilliant.It turns out it makes quite a difference to him whether he\u2019s with a man or a woman. It also turns out that it makes no difference to Robbie. They\u2019re both a bit surprised by these discoveries.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s just the same to you,\u201d he says, late at night in the dark, when they\u2019re together and sated and he\u2019s trailing patterns with his fingers on Robbie\u2019s skin.Robbie doesn\u2019t move a muscle, and yet James could swear he can feel him shrug beneath his fingers.\u201cNot the same,\u201d Robbie says easily. \u201cBut just as good.\u201dFor a moment \u2013 just a moment \u2013 James almost mentions Jean. But he doesn\u2019t. They haven\u2019t talked about her since that strange not-conversation over breakfast weeks ago, and the last thing he wants to do is bring her spectre into their bed. Even if it\u2019s the bedroom \u2013 actually the very same bed \u2013 Robbie was sharing with her just a few months ago. Besides, no good can come of James constantly comparing himself to her and wondering how far he falls short. Apples and oranges, Robbie would say. He\u2019s probably right.\u201cWhere\u2019s your mind gone?\u201d Robbie\u2019s voice rumbles beside him, and then there\u2019s lips on his throat and hands on his thighs, tongue trailing down his body, warm mouth right there where he\u2019s most sensitive \u2013 and there\u2019s just time to marvel at how easily Robbie has taken to this, taken to it with the same easy confidence he shows in everything, even though it has to be eons apart from anything he\u2019s ever even imagined \u2013 before there\u2019s no more room for thought. Not tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Only no matter how sincerely Robbie protests that it\u2019s all the same and just as good and he\u2019s happy, no really, he is, even this radical change hasn\u2019t erased the shadows around his eyes. James isn\u2019t so na\u00efve that he\u2019d thought sex might fix all their problems. But maybe just a tiny part of him had thought \u2013 or had hoped \u2013Well, perhaps a bit of him had been that na\u00efve.He knows even less about the human heart than he does about geometry, that\u2019s clear, but even he can\u2019t miss the obvious conclusion. They\u2019re having sex, and Robbie clearly enjoys it, and is clearly happy with him, and yet his eyes still trail after Jean with that sad, wistful sort of look. So it was never sex, or the lack thereof, that was the issue. It isn\u2019t James-and-Robbie that\u2019s the problem. That works. That\u2019s always worked.It\u2019s the lack of Jean.And James is hard pressed not to think that that\u2019s entirely his fault.James thinks sometimes that it would all be a lot easier if he didn\u2019t care about Jean.He never intended to. He\u2019d been quite happy with the way they\u2019d moved in and out of each other\u2019s lives orbiting Robbie, like two moons casting shadows on each other, but never quite on a collision course, always just managing to avoid a supernova explosion.He\u2019d liked that balance of non-interaction. It had worked for them.But somehow, without noticing it, Jean had got under his skin, in all her curious blend of strength and fragility, in the way she could flay you alive with a half-dozen precisely chosen words and all the time look at you with eyes that radiated melancholy. The Jean Innocent who curled up on Robbie\u2019s couch and gave sardonic commentary on the football, or threw popcorn at Robbie and giggled when he told her to \u2018have a bit of respect for the game\u2019, was demonstrably not the same Jean Innocent who struck terror into the heart of the most hardened DCI and, despite himself, James had become intrigued by the discrepancy. He found himself watching the paradox that was their CS with closer and closer attention and he hasn\u2019t been able to stop, although he\u2019s seen no evidence of that warm-hearted woman with the sardonic sense of humour in recent weeks.She\u2019s been on an absolute tear lately. Every other report is sent back for corrections or rewriting, cases are always \u2018too slow\u2019 and \u2018too expensive\u2019 and even when James manages to wrap up a break-and-enter in less than three hours, she turns up her nose at him. He\u2019d take it personally, if she wasn\u2019t dragging everyone from DCI down to the most junior constable over the coals. Actually, James thinks he\u2019s getting off lightly compared to most. She doesn\u2019t look at him much, talks to him less, but now and then he\u2019ll catch her eye and there\u2019ll be something almost apologetic there. Although what she has to apologise for, he hasn\u2019t the faintest. If he were in her position \u2013 well, when he was in her position \u2013 he\u2019d been downright ferocious.It\u2019s blindingly obvious that it\u2019s all driven by some nexus of misery over the divorce and misery-guilt-shame over Robbie, and James hates to see it. More than that, he hates not knowing how she is and not having the right to ask. He wonders how her divorce is going, and whether she\u2019s had to meet with Andrew again, whether she\u2019s finally agreed to pay for maintenance, whether her son has called recently. He shouldn\u2019t care about any of these things. But he does. And not just because it\u2019s clear Robbie cares, and wants answers, and won\u2019t ask.Which is what leads him into one crucial, unforgivable error.He\u2019s giving her a summary on the latest rash of break-and-enters down in Iffley Village and she\u2019s nodding, not really listening, looking tired and listless. On the desk in front of her is a letter with a very recognisable letterhead. It\u2019s from her lawyers. James has seen it often enough to know. So when he\u2019s made his case for a warrant, and she\u2019s blinked and nodded and clearly hasn\u2019t heard a word because the old Jean Innocent would never have given him a warrant on such flimsy evidence, he nods at the letter and says,\u201cAny closer to settlement?\u201dThat gets her attention.She frowns at him, and for a moment he thinks she\u2019s going to snap back with something sharp that means \u2018none of your business\u2019 but is considerably longer and more cutting. But then she slumps down in her chair and says miserably, \u201cWe have to be. Both our assets are frozen until we can come to an agreement, and Andrew\u2019s hardly got any income while he\u2019s on research leave.\u201dAnd she\u2019ll keep him like that until he\u2019s so short on cash he has to settle. For a moment, James is reminded what a terrifying woman their CS really is, and how dangerous she is to cross. Then he thinks about the man he\u2019d met that night at the Sheldonian, with his soft features and his smug smile and his words carefully chosen to wound, and thinks he\u2019s not sure how much he cares.\u201cGood,\u201d he says, with so much vicious satisfaction that she looks up at him with raised eyebrows and a soft, pleased smile on her face.James tugs at his collar nervously, suddenly aware that she\u2019s looking at him with more warmth than she has in weeks, and her smile is taking him back to cosy evenings on Robbie\u2019s couch and a tentative truce that had occasionally \u2013 more than occasionally \u2013 been more than a ceasefire. Sometimes it had actually been fun. He\u2019d certainly enjoyed taking her arse of a husband down a peg or two.And then her eyes go cold and her eyebrows shoot up to her hairline. She\u2019s staring at his throat, and James realises that he\u2019s accidentally exposed the tiny bruise Robbie left at the base of his throat.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s done it accidentally.\u00a0\u00a0He opens his mouth to say \u2013 to say \u2013 God, what can he say? Sorry? Or I didn\u2019t mean to show you that? Or, do you really think I\u2019m so cruel? Or even, this can\u2019t surprise you.And all of those things are wrong, and none of them will help, and they stare at each other and neither of them have any idea what the other is thinking. That\u2019s always been the problem, hasn\u2019t it. They don\u2019t understand each other and never have.\u201cHow are you getting on with Inspector Lewis?\u201d she says suddenly, her face a mask of polite professionalism and her eyes glinting like shards of glass in among bitter old coffee grounds.He stares at her, thoroughly thrown by the question, and almost says, you mean in bed? before realising that\u2019s the last thing she would ever be asking him, under any circumstances, and particularly not here. Although what she means by the question is a bit of a mystery.\u201cUm, fine, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he says cautiously. \u201cSame as always.\u201dHer eyes narrow. She doesn\u2019t like the lie any more than he likes telling it, but then, what\u2019s he supposed to say here? She\u2019s not seriously expecting him to declare a conflict of interest here and now? It would be too absurd, and too painful for them both. \u00a0\u201cI note Lewis is giving you a lot more responsibility of late,\u201d she says coolly, and James is suddenly on edge without knowing why. \u201cYou\u2019re handling his briefings,\u201d \u2013 only because Robbie\u2019s keeping a wide berth of her sharp tongue \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re managing cases,\u201d \u2013 he has to, when she keeps nabbing their DCs and they\u2019ve got four open cases on the go \u2013 \u201cand you\u2019re attending personnel and budget reviews,\u201d \u2013 at her insistence. \u201cIt seems to me, Sergeant, that you\u2019re performing all the offices of a Detective Inspector, and should be recognised and renumerated as such.\u201dFor a long moment, he doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s saying. The words simply do not compute. And then comprehension comes in one terrible rush.\u201cWhat? Oh no, I \u2013 \u201d\u201cI\u2019ve recommended you for promotion in the next round,\u201d she barrels straight over the top of him. \u201cTell Lewis I\u2019ll need a reference from him on my desk by the end of the week.\u201dHe stares at her, speechless, and she gazes straight back, clear-eyed and implacable.\u201cNo,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t applied for promotion. I\u2019m happy where I am. I don\u2019t want \u2013 \u201d\u201cYou were taken on by the Fast Track scheme and it\u2019s my duty as your senior officer to encourage you to reach your full potential. It\u2019s Lewis\u2019s too, not that I\u2019ve seen any evidence that he thinks about your professional development.\u201dColour rushes to James\u2019 cheeks \u2013 he opens his mouth, about to say something in defence of Robbie \u2013 possibly something so unforgivable it gets him fired instead of promoted \u2013 and her eyes stop him in his tracks. Huge hazel holes of unforgiving misery sucking him into their merciless depths.There has to be something he can say here \u2013 some way he can make her understand that this job wouldn\u2019t be worth it for him if it wasn\u2019t for Robbie \u2013 and surely she gets that, she\u2019s seen enough of how they work in and out of the nick. No matter how hurt she is, she can\u2019t resent him for taking what she didn\u2019t want.She can. She does.\u201cI never wanted this,\u201d tumbles out of his lips. \u201cYou know that. This was your choice.\u201dHe looks at her helplessly and she gazes right back, cool and corrosive as a glacier in his path. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in what you wanted,\u201d she says, which is a damned lie if ever James heard one. If anything, James thinks the problem is that she\u2019s cared too much about what everyone else wanted and not enough about what she wanted or needed for herself.\u201cThat\u2019s all, Sergeant.\u201dHis shoulders sag in defeat. He feels his own complete inadequacy more than ever.\u00a0 He has to stop talking through silences - just once he has to find the right words to say - to say - but then\u00a0it's impossible to know what to say when you don't even know what you want.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s staring at him with that blank look,\u00a0and she's like\u00a0an\u00a0iceberg in the water\u00a0when there's\u00a0dangerous currents swirling and you're far too far from shore.\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he murmurs, and goes before he can say something that doesn\u2019t just get him promoted but gets him bloody well transferred to the other side of the country. She\u2019d do it, too, if he gave her a reason. He doesn\u2019t doubt that for a minute.She\u2019s a terrifying woman, he thinks again, and hates that in amongst the fury and the righteous indignation, he can\u2019t extinguish a tiny flame of involuntary admiration.Robbie doesn\u2019t react with anything like the chagrin James is counting on.\u201cShe\u2019s probably right,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not doing things by the book.\u201dThat\u2019s not why she\u2019s doing it, though. They both know that.\u201cGood of her to keep us out of trouble,\u201d Robbie continues philosophically, and James raises one disbelieving eyebrow.\u201cShe misses you,\u201d James tells him quietly, and doesn\u2019t miss the brief flash of pain in Robbie\u2019s eyes.\u201cHer decision,\u201d Robbie mumbles.But the more James thinks about it, the more he\u2019s not so sure it was. Not entirely. Jean might have chosen to leave them, but they\u2019d made their choice too. They\u2019d chosen to let her go. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t expected that. Together all of them had chosen to let someone else decide their mutual fate, and by this string of non-decisions they\u2019ve ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes.Well, almost the worst. Jean could have been fired, Robbie demoted and James penalised. Maybe Robbie\u2019s right. It is good of her to boot him up the professional ladder instead of subjecting them both to disciplinary proceedings.\u201cYou\u2019re to write me a reference,\u201d James tells him quietly.The corner of Robbie\u2019s mouth lifts in a quiet half-smile. \u201cThat so? Well, they\u2019d better be prepared for a bleeding essay. I\u2019ll need half a book to sing your praises.\u201dIt\u2019s said with studious lightness, but the look on Robbie\u2019s face is soft and steady, and James\u2019 eyes are suddenly wet with grief and joy all at once. It\u2019s a rare day when Robbie pays him a compliment, and all the more precious for it.\u201cAnd the other half to list my flaws, no doubt,\u201d James manages when he\u2019s got his throat working again.Robbie grins at him with a glint of mischief in his eyes. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say you\u2019re much good at taking orders. I won\u2019t lie about that one.\u201dThat\u2019s a come-on if ever James heard one. He smirks, moves closer, suggests, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll give me a chance to prove myself, sir.\u00a0 I ought to show you how obedient I can be, with the proper motivation.\u201dRobbie arches one eyebrow, warm and amused and gloriously, solidly, his. For a moment the joy of it damn near takes James\u2019 breath away.\u201cC\u2019mon now,\u201d Robbie tells him, and reaches for him with hot, hungry fingers. \u201cI never wanted a sergeant who followed the rules.\u201dAnd so the reference is written, and the paperwork goes in, and Jean scowls at them both as if she\u2019s lost another battle. But they\u2019re all losing, James thinks. They\u2019re losing every single goddamned day, and he doesn\u2019t have a clue what to do about it.\u00a0 He wonders when things got this fucked up, and how it is that he\u2019s managed to get exactly what he wants, and yet still feel like he\u2019s missing out on something vital.\u201cYou miss her,\u201d he says quietly, late one night when the TV is off and the lights are dim and surely Robbie is about to suggest it\u2019s time for bed.But this is not a bedroom conversation. James needs his clothes on for this. He needs at least one layer to hide behind.\u201cWouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Robbie says finally and, James thinks, not entirely truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her, I guess.\u201dJames bites his lip and thinks perhaps that\u2019s more telling than anything. That\u2019s how this whole mess started, didn\u2019t it? With Jean unhappy, and Robbie desperate to help any way he could, and then with James unhappy and Robbie torn between his sense of responsibility to them both.Perhaps getting what they want has never been an option. Perhaps this has never been about wanting at all, only about needing. James and Jean need Robbie, and Robbie needs to be needed. What a twisted triangle they make.\u201cYou miss her,\u201d he says again and despite his best intentions, it comes out like an accusation.\u201cAh now, lad, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d Robbie says instantly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change anything here.\u201dOf course it does. They both know it.\u201cI know I\u2019m not always very good at talking about things,\u201d Robbie mumbles, \u201cbut I do \u2013 I mean - \u201dRobbie falters and stares down at where his fingers are resting on the arm of the chair. He\u2019s so still, James marvels, always still and solid and steady. Never fidgeting, never shifting, never dodging the bullet when something has to be done or things finally need to be said. Always meeting every demand placed on him. It\u2019s time James carried a bit of the weight.\u201cI know,\u201d James tells him. \u201cMe too.\u201dRobbie looks up, grins half-shyly, says, \u201cYeah?\u201d and then, \u201cLook, let me say it all the same. I may not manage it again before we\u2019re both in nursing homes.\u201dHe pauses, grits his teeth, and then \u2013 every word being pulled out of him as agonisingly as if a surgeon were unravelling his intestines \u2013 \u201c\u2019m not good with words, lad, but I do love you.\u201dEach word hits James cold and sharp and sweet as snowflakes settling on his skin.It\u2019s not anything he hasn\u2019t already known \u2013 it\u2019s been there all along, in everything Robbie says and everything he does \u2013 and yet hearing the words changes everything. For the first time in what feels like years his feet stop tapping and his fingers uncurl and every nervous fidgety part of him seems to still beneath the blanket of this beautiful certainty.\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says, his mouth on automatic. It\u2019s so unthinkingly, unquestioningly true that he doesn\u2019t have to pause for even a second to think do I want this? Or, is this okay?And into the stillness of this perfect certainty floods a range of newly understood possibilities. Suddenly, instantly, everything is clear as the winter nights, and he\u2019s able to say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to miss her. It would be okay if you wanted her back.\u201dRobbie opens his mouth \u2013 makes to protest \u2013 but the guilty look in his eyes tells James they\u2019re on the right track now, and they\u2019re finally talking about the thing they\u2019ve been studiously not-discussing for weeks.\u201cYour heart isn\u2019t like a loaf of bread, Robbie. If you give some to Jean, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to give me a smaller piece.\u201dHe understands that now, understands it better than he thinks Robbie or Jean ever have. They\u2019ve both seen love go wrong, both experienced all the bitterness and misery and complexity of loss. Doubtless they think he\u2019s na\u00efve, but James thinks his naivety might just be an asset here. It lets him see things clearly in a way they so obviously can\u2019t.\u201cI only want us all to be happy.\u201dThat\u2019s the sum of all his wants and needs. That\u2019s the sum of everything they\u2019ve been saying and haven\u2019t been saying. It\u2019s the only possible answer to this equation that won\u2019t resolve.\u201cI know, lad,\u201d Robbie says quietly. \u201cBut you and I are happy, aren\u2019t we? Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201dJames frowns into the stillness and thinks that it both is and it isn\u2019t. It is, because it\u2019s all the selfish part of him wants or has ever wanted \u2013 for Robbie to be happy, and to be happy with him. But it hasn\u2019t worked out like that. Somehow all their happiness is bound up not just in each other but in a third person. They\u2019re bound together, all three of them, and he\u2019s not sure two can ever be entirely happy while the third is so obviously miserable.But Robbie\u2019s face is set, and it\u2019s clear he won\u2019t welcome any more discussion of this. Not tonight, anyway.\u201cAll right,\u201d James capitulates. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201dSo they do, I love you, ringing in both their ears. Sometimes, James thinks, there are things that have to be said out loud, no matter how hard or how painful. Some decisions need words.It\u2019s easy to realise \u2013 quietly, in the dead of the night \u2013 that one plus one does not quite equal two, and there\u2019s a value still missing, and that value might be Jean. It\u2019s much harder to vocalise that knowledge in any way Robbie or Jean might accept.And so the weeks go on and the wind turns icy and the days get shorter and still, somehow, James hasn\u2019t found a way to get Jean to look at them as anything more than her most troublesome pair of detectives and a monumental error in her otherwise impeccable judgement.Christmas decorations go up on Cornmarket, and carollers make the rounds of Cowley, and Robbie has a surprise insight that takes them on a midnight chase through Summertown to nab the infamous strangler in the act of throttling his latest victim with a line of Christmas lights. Peterson is politely furious that they\u2019ve solved his case, Robbie is smugly content, and Jean gives them a rare but very genuine smile.It\u2019s the season of goodwill and forgiveness and all that nonsense, and the wayward Catholic in James feels like the time is ripe for some sort of reconciliation. If only he can figure out a way to communicate to both Robbie and Jean the solution he\u2019s devised.The station Christmas party falls on the first Friday in December, and for half a minute James actually thinks about cornering Jean when she\u2019s had one too many eggnogs and laying out what he\u2019s been thinking. But he takes one look at her strained smile as she trades barbed compliments with DI Grainger and thinks better of that plan. James disapproves of these Bacchanalian revels that are more pagan than Christian and tend to encourage thoroughly unprofessional behaviour, but Jean\u2019s tight smile suggests there\u2019s at least one person who takes a far grimmer view of the festivities. No doubt these events are hell on the bottom line and, unless everyone behaves with the utmost decorum (and they never do), create a whole lot of personnel problems for her in the new year.So he steers clear of Jean, who\u2019s smiling like she\u2019s just entered the seventh circle of hell and is preparing to charm the devil, and of Robbie, who\u2019s frowning in sympathetic misery. He flirts with Julie and jokes with Gurdip and keeps a safe distance between himself and Sergeant Crouch until Hooper\u2019s smirk catches his attention. Crouch and Hooper and a few other DCs are exchanging amused, not-very-nice smiles and glancing meaningfully at their CS. James follows their eyes and then has to hold back a small smile of his own. Jean is standing beneath a sprig of mistletoe, and she hasn\u2019t noticed.He wonders vaguely who came up with the decidedly not-very-bright idea of putting mistletoe up at the office Christmas party. It\u2019s not going to do workplace relations any good to have half the force planting kisses on the handful of young and good-looking new recruits. But he doesn\u2019t have to look far to find the culprit. Gurdip is also staring at Jean, looking decidedly nonplussed by this turn of events. Of course. The bloke\u2019s an incurable romantic, and still waiting for his chance to make a move on Julie. James wonders if Gurdip knows Julie\u2019s engaged now, and if someone should tell him. James certainly won\u2019t; he\u2019s caused enough heartbreak this year, thank you very much.But Jean is still standing there, still unawares, and now the looks are spreading. People are looking at Robbie, too, and none too surreptitiously, but he\u2019s deep in conversation with Laura and quite oblivious. James wonders what\u2019s worse \u2013 the fact that the whole force is only too aware of what\u2019s gone on between them, or the fact that Robbie and Jean believe they\u2019ve been the height of discretion. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that Jean is still standing there and no one is stepping forwards. James may not know much about etiquette or gallantry, but he knows better than to leave a beautiful woman alone under mistletoe.So he gives Hooper just one warning look, steels himself, walks forward and says gravely, \u201cHappy Christmas, Ma\u2019am.\u201d And before she can summon up the breath to reply \u2013 in fact, she\u2019s barely raised her chin to look at him \u2013 he leans down and plants the lightest of kisses on her lips. He notices abstractedly that her lips are very soft, and also that he has to bend down a considerable way to kiss her. She\u2019s like a force of nature, most days. She fills any room she enters with her particular brand of astringent good will. No wonder, then, that he\u2019s never noticed how small she actually is. He wonders now how Robbie could bear it; the kiss is murder on his back.There\u2019s wolf whistles from Hooper and the lads, someone\u2019s egging him on, \u201cAttaboy, Hathaway!\u201d, but he\u2019s more concerned by the way her whole body has started vibrating with tension. There\u2019s a decent chance she\u2019s going to slap him, he thinks suddenly, and doesn\u2019t like to think about the kind of stories that\u2019ll start spreading around the nick. He wonders if Robbie\u2019s watching them, and what he thinks of this development. If he understands the point James is making.\u201cYou could start coming round again,\u201d he whispers very quickly and very quietly into her ear.He pulls back and looks at her meaningfully. \u201cYou make better tea,\u201d he says. He wishes that he was capable of saying anything directly and sincerely. This constant dry understatement gets wearing. But there\u2019s precious few people he knows how to be open with (only one, really), and he and Jean Innocent have never learned how to talk without irony. So he says, \u201cDoesn\u2019t taste quite the same when Robbie makes it,\u201d in as casual a tone as he can muster, and hopes she understands that he means, He misses you. I like you around too.\u201cOh,\u201d she says, so quietly he hears the shape of her lips and not the sound of her voice. Then, \u201cwhat?\u201dAt least it\u2019s bewilderment rather than anger that\u2019s animating her features.\u201cMistletoe,\u201d he says, and glances upwards meaningfully. She looks up too, goes quite red, and says in a very different tone of voice, \u201cWell that\u2019s unprofessional. See that that\u2019s taken down, Sergeant. Immediately.\u201dBut her smile says something very different from her brusque tone. He thinks maybe for the first time they\u2019re starting to understand each other.That night, very late, there\u2019s a knock at the door. James lopes off to answer it and isn\u2019t in the least bit surprised to find their CS tapping a nervous rhythm with her foot on the doorstep.\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d she says abruptly, no greetings, just straight into it, \u201cwe\u2019ve got four ways to resolve this situation.\u201dFour. Lord, it\u2019s taken this long for James to come up with one. Jean Innocent has probably always been an overachiever.He smiles at her, and steps back, letting the light from the living room spill out onto the doorstep.\u201cCome in,\u201d he tells her, while somewhere inside Robbie says, \u201cIs that Jean? What\u2019s she doing standing out in the cold?\u201dJames and Jean\u00a0exchange the smallest of secret, amused half-smiles. They\u2019re ready to talk about it now. Maybe Robbie is too.And as he closes the door behind her, somewhere not too far off a jaunty Christmas carol starts to play.Two constants govern James Hathaway\u2019s existence: he\u2019s certain of God (unwillingly, infuriatingly, still with many unanswered questions), and he\u2019s certain of Robbie Lewis (entirely, undoubtingly, without any questions at all).Both have been tested in fire and shine the brighter for it. His relationship with God may be an ongoing process of trial and error \u2013 more a harrowing ordeal than peaceful communion \u2013 but James doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever have cause to doubt Robbie again.Lately, there\u2019s a third, inconstant truth James has come to live by: he\u2019s not certain about Jean Innocent. He respects her, he likes her, and life is certainly easier with her around. He\u2019s starting to think he might even care about her. But it\u2019s new, and it\u2019s fragile, and he doubts he\u2019ll ever have the kind of rock solid faith in her that he has in Robbie, or that he wishes he could have in God.But that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the nub of all these inconstant truths, really. There are some things James knows, some things he doesn\u2019t, and some things he just has to take on faith.He thinks he\u2019s learning to be okay with that."}}, "4635444": {"Bookmarks:": "1", "Chapters:": "1/1", "Words:": "3211", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Close Quarters", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Robert Lewis"], "Published:": "2015-08-23", "Category:": ["M/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Hits:": "583", "Kudos:": "59", "Summary": "\n\n\u201cVery funny, sergeant,\u201d Lewis growls. \u201cSo what options do I have?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPrecisely one, by my calculation.\u201d James reaches inside his jacket pocket and pulls out his own room-key. \u201cWe can share.

With the smoke held between his lips, he looks down at the screen. Lewis. Probably just checking where he needs to be in the morning, and more than likely making sure that James brings him a coffee and something tasty from the breakfast buffet.\n\u201cMissing me already, sir? It\u2019s only been an hour or so since you dropped me off.\u201d And it\u2019s late, too; after eleven o\u2019clock. With an early start tomorrow, he\u2019d have expected his boss to be in bed.\n\u201cFunny. I\u2019m on me way back to you. Can\u2019t stay at Lyn\u2019s after all.\u201d James frowns; Lewis had contacted his daughter as soon as Innocent told them they were going on a course in Manchester. Lyn, apparently, had been delighted at the prospect of her father visiting, and had only expressed regret that she didn\u2019t also have room for James. With the new baby, things are apparently a bit chaotic chez Lyn and partner.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHe can hear the resignation in Lewis\u2019s voice as he speaks \u2014 on his Bluetooth as he\u2019s driving; James can hear the echo. \u201cJack\u2019s just getting over a cold. It\u2019s nothing serious \u2014 I told Lyn if I\u2019d had a quid for every cold she or Mark had when they were bairns I\u2019d\u2019ve been able to retire years ago. But apparently he\u2019s had several over the winter and the last one turned into an ear infection. So, anyway, I coughed five minutes after walkin\u2019 in, and she asked if I could stay somewhere else. Doesn\u2019t want to risk me bein\u2019 around Jack if I\u2019m coming down with something.\u201d\n\u201cOver-protective mum? But she\u2019s a nurse, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShould know better? Yeah, but you can\u2019t tell her. Anyway, look, I need you to get me a room, okay? I\u2019ll be there in about ten minutes.\u201d\nJames agrees, and Lewis ends the call almost before he\u2019s had time to say goodbye.\n\nHe\u2019s waiting in the car park when Lewis drives in. His boss gets out and rounds the car to the boot to grab his overnight bag before James can say anything.\n\u201cGot me room sorted?\u201d Lewis asks as James walks over.\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d And Lewis is definitely not going to be happy. His boss is already tired; they\u2019d had a long day at the office, followed by the drive up to Manchester in rush-hour traffic, Lewis driving while James phoned in reports to Innocent and instructions to the DCs in their absence. Lewis had intended to have a cuppa with his daughter and her partner and then go straight to bed. \nIn the light over the building entrance, James sees Lewis scowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re fully booked, sir. No rooms to spare. I did take the liberty of phoning around to a couple of nearby hotels, but it\u2019s the start of Fresher\u2019s Week at the universities, so apparently they\u2019re full with parents seeing off their little darlings\u2014\u201d\n\u201cVery funny, sergeant,\u201d Lewis growls. \u201cSo what options do I have?\u201d \n\u201cPrecisely one, by my calculation.\u201d James reaches inside his jacket pocket and pulls out his own room-key. \u201cWe can share. Well, alternatively, one of us sleeps in your car, but I don\u2019t recommend that. It\u2019s going to be a cold night.\u201d\n\u201cShare?\u201d Lewis doesn\u2019t sound as grateful as James thinks he might have had reason to expect. \u201cWhat are the rooms like here, then?\u201d\nJames keeps his expression as steady as he can. \u201cIt\u2019s a police training centre, sir. About as luxurious as you would expect.\u201d\n\u201cBloody buggering hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in, sir.\u201d \nJames stands back to allow Lewis to enter his bedroom \u2014 now their shared bedroom. And Lewis\u2019s reaction is complete silence.\nWell, it\u2019s understandable. The room is not much more than a quarter the size of their shared office, with a standard double bed \u2014 and they\u2019re fortunate it\u2019s not a single \u2014 and a small desk and single chair. It\u2019s an upright office chair, which James has already decided is not at all suitable for sleeping. There\u2019s adequate floor space to sleep on, certainly, but the receptionist went off-duty before he\u2019d finished phoning round the hotels, and the night porter he spoke to claims not to know where to look for spare bedding.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lewis says after the silence has stretched for close to a minute. It\u2019s spoken with the air of a man who\u2019s reached the end of his patience. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be a restless sleeper, Hathaway.\u201d\n\u201cI will endeavour not to be so, sir.\u201d \nIn mutual silence, they prepare for bed, taking turns in the bathroom. When James emerges, in the T-shirt and shorts he\u2019d brought for sleeping, Lewis is already in bed. \u201cI could sleep on top of the covers, sir,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThe room\u2019s warm enough\u2014\u201d\nThere\u2019s an abrupt click, one they both recognise as the central heating switching itself off. \nLewis throws back the blanket on the other side of the bed. \u201cJust get yourself in and turn the light off, James. An\u2019 remind me to phone round the hotels again first thing.\u201d\n\u201cSir.\u201d\n\nIn the event, it\u2019s not James who\u2019s the restless sleeper. \nLewis tosses and turns and thrashes about so much that James suspects he\u2019ll end up with bruises all over his calves and shins, not to mention an aching back. His boss does appear to be asleep, but it can\u2019t possibly be a restful sleep. The only small mercy, for which James is profoundly grateful, is that Lewis isn\u2019t talking in his sleep. It would be unbearable, for many reasons, were James to have proof \u2014 rather than just his suspicions \u2014 that Lewis is dreaming about his wife. There are selfish reasons, of course, but also because of the overwhelming sense of inadequacy that grips him whenever Lewis\u2019s grief rises sharply to the fore again. \nLewis turns over again, this time knocking his arm against James\u2019s shoulder. At this rate, neither of them\u2019s going to get a good night\u2019s sleep, which won\u2019t bode well for the training session. Or, more importantly, for Lewis\u2019s state of mind tomorrow. He\u2019ll be grumpy and bloody-minded, leaving James to do damage limitation without access to his usual means of improving his boss\u2019s mood. The coffee at this training centre, from what he\u2019s seen so far, is not what James would consider drinkable, and the breaks are too short to find alternative sources of refreshment. It\u2019ll be evening before he can take Lewis to a decent pub for a relaxing drink and meal.\nWhen Lewis rolls over yet again, James takes a deep breath and takes action. He turns over, facing his boss\u2019s back, and slides up close to Lewis until he can wrap his arm around his boss\u2019s chest. \nIt\u2019s the closest he\u2019s ever likely to come to embracing Lewis. That\u2019s not why he\u2019s doing it, of course \u2014 or so he tells himself. If the reassurance of touch and a familiar presence close to Lewis will help to settle him and calm the restlessness he seems unable to escape from, then it\u2019s the right thing for James to do. As long as Lewis sees it that way whenever he realises what\u2019s happening, of course, and doesn\u2019t see it as a gross intrusion. \n He waits, heart pounding \u2014 he\u2019s taking a hell of a liberty, after all \u2014 but Lewis sighs softly, brings his hand up to rest over James\u2019s, and settles into the most relaxed sleeping position he\u2019s adopted since they went to bed.\nJames closes his eyes again and, miraculously, sleeps.\n\nWhen he wakes, the side of his neck is being nuzzled.\nThey\u2019ve shifted position in the night. Lewis is now behind him, pressed up against him and with his arm wrapped securely around James. \nIt\u2019s any number of dreams come true, but it also has the potential to turn into his worst nightmare, depending on Lewis\u2019s reaction when he wakes and realises what he\u2019s doing. \nJames opens one eye and focuses blurrily on the clock radio next to the bed. Quarter to seven. Lewis had asked him to set it for quarter past last night, to give them time to be down by shortly after eight for the introductory session, held over breakfast. \n\u201cCan\u2019t bloody let us eat in peace, can they? Got to be blathering at us over our Weetabix,\u201d Lewis had grumbled, and James hadn\u2019t disagreed.\nSo: another half-hour of this perfect torture, with the risk of discovery at any moment, or...\nJames slides very carefully out of bed, making every effort not to wake Lewis. His boss mumbles a soft protest, but just buries his head in the pillow and resumes sleeping. James picks up his clothes and pads softly into the bathroom to get dressed. He\u2019ll shower when he gets back; for now, he has another mission in mind.\nIt\u2019s just after twenty past seven when he lets himself back into the room. Lewis is sitting on the bed, mostly dressed, shirt on but without a tie. \u201cThere you are. Must\u2019ve smoked half a pack, time you were gone.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d Bugger, bugger, bugger... not before James got out of bed, please.\n\u201cHeard you close the door behind you. Thought I\u2019d speed things up by taking me shower while you were gone.\u201d Lewis frowns then, his gaze focusing on the oddly-shaped bag James is balancing in one hand. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got there?\u201d\n\u201cBreakfast. From the Costa five minutes\u2019 drive from here.\u201d He unpacks the bag; tea and Lewis\u2019s favourite cinnamon roll, and a double-strength Americano with an almond croissant for himself. \u201cThis way, you\u2019re not getting talked at over breakfast.\u201d\nLewis stands and comes to take his breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019re a good bloke, James. Far better than I deserve after bein\u2019 such a miserable sod last night.\u201d He takes a bite of his roll. \u201cDunno what I\u2019ll do whenever you decide to move on to Inspector.\u201d\nJames focuses on adding sugar to his coffee. \u201cI doubt that will happen before you retire, sir.\u201d If ever.\nAs he glances upwards while still apparently focused on his task, he sees Lewis watching him. But his boss only nods in acknowledgement of his answer. \u201cWell, anyway,\u201d Lewis adds after a moment, \u201cyou\u2019d best get ready.\u201d He inclines his head towards the bathroom. James takes the opportunity to gather up his clean clothes. As he\u2019s about to close the ensuite door, Lewis adds, \u201cThanks for sharin\u2019 your bed last night, too, man. That was right good of you. Hope I didn\u2019t keep you awake?\u201d\n\u201cSlept like a baby, sir,\u201d James replies quickly, and immediately closes the door before Lewis can see his face.\nShit. As soon as he\u2019s dressed, he\u2019ll have to check uk.hotels.com and find Lewis somewhere for tonight. He can\u2019t go through last night again. He just can\u2019t.\n\nBut finding time to book Lewis a room isn\u2019t as easy as he\u2019d anticipated. He\u2019s just loaded the website on his phone in the dining-room when the room falls silent \u2014 and stays silent. He glances up \u2014 to find everyone\u2019s gaze on him.\n\u201cAs per the written instructions sent to all of you beforehand, all phones and other electronic devices are to be switched off and out of sight for the duration of the course,\u201d a too-hearty voice announces from the head of the table.\n\u201cOh, god, it\u2019s Peterson\u2019s clone,\u201d Lewis mutters, and James has to stifle a snort of laughter. Obediently, however, he puts his phone away. Morning break, he resolves.\nMorning break, though, it turns out, is not so much a break as it is a different form of pedagogy. Training participants are to collect their drinks and then sit at pre-assigned groups in the break-room to brainstorm problems with current methodologies of suspect-interviewing. And the pre-assignments are designed to ensure that no participant is sitting with someone from the same force. Lewis catches James\u2019s eye, expression resigned, as he takes his seat at a table across the room from James. \nThey\u2019re at least given a proper break at lunchtime, but Lewis commandeers him and insists they take their sandwiches outside, so Lewis can vent his frustration about the idiots he\u2019s been teamed up with for most of the morning, who wouldn\u2019t know an interview strategy if it slapped them in the face. James takes the opportunity to gain some relief by sharing his own feelings about the morning\u2019s activities, and before he knows it their break is over and he\u2019s had no opportunity to sort out his boss\u2019s accommodation.\nThe afternoon session is much more interesting, and James gets completely caught up in discussion of new techniques, so much so that he\u2019s still debating advantages over dinner, much to his boss\u2019s amusement. \nIt\u2019s not until they\u2019re in the bar a couple of hours later, finishing their second pints, that his omission occurs to him. \u201cSir! I meant to book you a hotel room.\u201d\nLewis frowns. \u201cSaid I\u2019d do it, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Relieved, James relaxes. \u201cYou found somewhere? Do you want to get your things from my room in a bit, and I\u2019ll phone you a taxi?\u201d\n\u201cAh. About that.\u201d Lewis\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually book anywhere. Forgot.\u201d\nBugger. His boss certainly isn\u2019t going to fancy a second night sharing with James. And a second night is far too risky from James\u2019 perspective. He got away with it last night \u2014 Lewis clearly had no idea that James held him all night, apart from when Lewis held him, and nor does he know that James liked it and wants more \u2014 but he knows his boss well enough to know that his chances of getting away with it a second night are slim.\n\u201cI\u2019ll look online now for you, sir.\u201d Immediately, he has his phone out and is looking up the hotel website.\n\u201cActually...\u201d His boss\u2019s tone makes James look up slowly. \u201cWas thinking. I mean, if it\u2019s not too much of an imposition \u2014 last night was fine, wasn\u2019t it? I could just\u2014\u201d Lewis rubs his eyebrow. \u201cShare your room again, eh?\u201d\nOhgodno. He forces a relaxed smile. \u201cOf course, sir. Not an imposition at all, if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be comfortable.\u201d\nLewis shrugs, draining his pint. \u201cSlept better last night than I have in weeks. An\u2019 normally I toss and turn for hours in a strange bed. Was worried last night I\u2019d keep you awake.\u201d\nJames drains his own glass. \u201cNot a bit of it, sir. Well, shall we?\u201d Standing, he takes a deep breath and straightens his shoulders. Into the valley of death rides one James Hathaway, and there\u2019s every chance he\u2019ll be felled by morning, unless he\u2019s very, very careful \u2014 and very, very lucky.\n\n\u201cJames?\u201d\nLewis\u2019s voice is low and intimate in the darkness, and James can\u2019t suppress a shiver. \u201cSir?\u201d\n\"Being a bit stand-offish, aren't you?\nJames\u2019s heart slams up into his throat. \u201cSir...?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean last night...\u201d Lewis pauses, and the confident amusement in his voice is making a prickly sweat crawl up James\u2019s arms. \u201cYou seemed happy to... cuddle.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d Abruptly, he breaks off. That\u2019s not condemnation or anger in Lewis\u2019s voice. And if his boss really had a problem with what had happened, he wouldn\u2019t have asked to share with James again, would he? \u201cI was.\u201d He turns around to face Lewis. \u201cAnd, actually, so were you. I just didn\u2019t realise you were aware of any of it.\u201d\n\u201cI was, for a bit, anyway. It was nice. But then you sneaked out of bed early.\u201d Lewis shifts closer. \u201cCouldn\u2019t decide at first whether you were embarrassed, or worried about how I\u2019d react.\u201d\n\u201cYou know me too well, sir.\u201d James smiles faintly at his boss. Both reasons are correct, of course, but at least Lewis hasn\u2019t hit on the main one: that James had liked being held by Lewis too much for comfort. Too much to risk Lewis finding out.\n\u201cI liked it,\u201d Lewis repeats. \u201cWas surprised at first, but once I thought about it I wasn\u2019t \u2014 we sit close all the time, don\u2019t we? Not much different, that.\u201d\nLewis isn\u2019t moving any closer, though. For a moment, James is confused \u2014 and then it occurs to him. Lewis is his boss, and they\u2019ve both been through seminars on harassment, abuse of authority and so on. This is James\u2019s move to make.\nHe slides nearer to Lewis and extends his arm. With no hesitation whatsoever, Lewis moves until his body is pressed against James\u2019s, and he wraps his arm around James\u2019s chest.\nSleep tugs him under moments later.\n\nJames is being kissed.\nWarm lips are pressing against his, expertly coaxing a response that he gladly gives. Fingers are tangled in his hair and a solid body is pressed against his side, and a stubbly cheek is brushing against his.\nChrist! Lewis... he must be dreaming, imagining he\u2019s with his wife, and when he wakes he\u2019s going to be\u2014\n\u201cJames.\u201d \nThe rough, low-voiced name is unmistakeable. But it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Lewis knows, and he\u2019s still kissing him? James catches his breath and brings his hand up to stroke Lewis\u2019s arm. \u201cSir,\u201d he murmurs, encouraging, against the lips that still cover his.\n\u201cHell!\u201d Abruptly, Lewis rears upwards and back, and sits upright in the bed, breathing heavily.\n\u201cSir?\u201d Is he supposed to apologise? Take the blame? Pretend he was asleep and has only just woken now, instead of seconds earlier?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lewis sounds awkward as well as contrite, and James hastens to make an attempt, at least, to reassure him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I realise you were asleep...\u201d But asleep and saying James\u2019s name? It doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know it was me.\u201d\nAnother sigh from Lewis, and he turns to look at James. There\u2019s awkwardness in his expression, but not the distaste James has been imagining. \u201cI did know, man. Woke up an\u2019 you were right there and... But I shouldn\u2019t have assumed you\u2019d want to. An\u2019 me bein\u2019 your boss... puts you under pressure, like.\u201d\nJames can\u2019t help it. He bursts out laughing, and it\u2019s as much in delight at discovering that Lewis actually does want him as it is at his boss\u2019s ridiculousness. \u201cIf you sincerely imagine for one second that I\u2019d have any difficulty saying no to you, sir...\u201d He shakes his head, then shifts closer and brushes his lips against Lewis\u2019s jaw. \u201cAll right?\u201d\nLewis wraps his arms around James and pulls him in for a warm, deep kiss. \u201cVery all right, canny lad.\u201d\n\nSome time later, James takes advantage of the fact that the alarm still hasn\u2019t gone off to stretch luxuriously, landing mostly on top of Lewis. \u201cAre we having a conference fling, then, sir?\u201d \n\u201cLess of the sir,\u201d Lewis growls. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be much of one, would it, since the course ends after lunch. Don\u2019t do one-night stands anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t either \u2014 at least, not intentionally,\u201d James confesses.\n\u201cGood. This won\u2019t be one, then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, are we scheduled for another conference, then\u2014\u201d James smirks. \u201c\u2014Robbie?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I might not put up more than a token protest next time Innocent wants to send us somewhere,\u201d Lewis says, as his hand starts moving in interesting patterns over James\u2019s hip.\nJames can think of some useful suggestions for what Lewis could say, but as there\u2019s only ten minutes before the alarm\u2019s due he decides the time \u2014 and his mouth \u2014 can be put to much better use.\n"}}, "4488537": {"Chapters:": "3/?", "Words:": "4977", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Jean Innocent"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Collide", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Jean Innocent"], "Published:": "2015-08-03", "Category:": ["F/M"], "Hits:": "304", "Kudos:": "16", "Summary": "\nAt moments of uncertainty, Hathaway and Innocent collide.\n", "Additional Tags:": ["Emotional Hurt/Comfort"], "Comments:": "1", "Archive Warnings:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings", "No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Authors": ["notmoreflippingelves"], "Language:": "English", "Updated:": "2015-08-22", "Text": {"1": "\nChapter Text\n\nPart One: The Richard Seagar Case (\"Intelligent Design\")\n\nJean Innocent started slightly when she heard the knock at her front door. Even before her husband had officially moved out two days ago, he had seldom spent much time at their flat. As a result, Jean had become accustomed to living in near silence. For the most part, she barely noticed the quiet, as the clamor in her mind largely overpowered any background noises. But when her mind was as bereft as it was now, the rare unexpected sound was deafening.\nShe glanced at the mantel clock, one of the few nice pieces Roger hadn\u2019t tried to take with him. At a quarter-past eleven, it was far later than she\u2019d realized. (Wasn\u2019t it strange how time simultaneous dragged and raced when life was all-but-empty?) It was rather late\u2014too late even for that very persistent Jehovah\u2019s Witness who\u2019d been harassing Jean for weeks. Still, if someone was calling at this hour, it must be important. Innocent put down the book she\u2019d been idly perusing, rose to her feet and re-tied her lilac silk dressing gown.\nFor a moment, Jean let herself believe that it was her husband at the door\u2014that Roger had finally realized what an idiot he\u2019d been and had come to grovel miserably at her feet. Depending on the eloquence and sincerity of his apology, she may even deign to forgive him\u2026eventually. \nShe shook herself out of this foolish daydream. Even if it was Roger, he was likely only here to get more things he\u2019d left behind. Well, he could have them, could even have the clothes off her back for all Jean cared, so long as he promised to bugger off for good this time.\nBut when she opened the door, her soon-to-be ex-husband wasn\u2019t the one waiting on her doorstop. It was James Hathaway, and he looked more lost than Jean had ever seen him.\nInnocent\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly at seeing him, and Hathaway wondered if Jean found it creepy that he knew where she lived. He himself was a little surprised that he\u2019d remembered. A few months ago, he\u2019d given her a lift to-and-from work, while her car was being serviced. Though it wasn\u2019t a particularly difficult street to find, James had assumed he\u2019d forgotten the way. And so he had\u2014until he had needed a place to go and found he could recall every turn perfectly.\nHathaway had known he shouldn\u2019t be on his own tonight. Not while he was feeling as hollow as he did now. Not while guilt was still gnawing at the minuscule part of him that could still feel. He briefly thought about going the pub, surrounding himself with other strangers who would be drowning their own sorrows. Just being around other people might be enough to keep him from falling over the precipice. But he knew that alcohol would make him more volatile\u2014more likely to do something he\u2019d regret. He had already had far too many close calls\u2014far too many moments when the only things keeping him alive were cowardice and surety of Hell. These moments had always been far from uncommon, but they\u2019d only increased in recent years.\nHe used to go to Lewis\u2019s when he felt particularly useless and unstable. But ever since the inspector had started seeing Dr. Hobson, Hathaway couldn\u2019t help but feel awkward around the pair of them. It wasn\u2019t because Hobson or Lewis was overly fond of embarrassing public-displays of affection. Nor was there much truth in the latest station rumor\u2014that James was inconsolable at thought of losing Robbie to Laura. Or at least, he wasn\u2019t inconsolable in the way that people thought.\nIt was simply that\u2014damn it\u2014they were so happy, and he didn\u2019t want to risk jeopardizing that.\nBesides which, going to his inspector now would prove an ineffective treatment for Hathaway\u2019s ailment. Moreover, James was starting to think that genuine happiness\u2014apart from a few scattered moments\u2014 was simply unattainable for someone like him. And he simply couldn\u2019t risk dragging his mentor down with him.\nBut if he couldn\u2019t be alone tonight, and if he couldn\u2019t be with Lewis or Hobson, then where could he go? James still wasn\u2019t sure how or why, but his mind had suddenly landed on Jean. He kept turning over what he\u2019d overheard her saying to Robbie\u2014about not looking forward to going home at night. He recalled the station gossip that her husband was leaving her for someone else. He suddenly realized that she\u2019d been looking tired, wan, and disheveled for several months now, and he cursed himself for not noticing earlier. If anyone understood how defeated and exhausted Hathaway was now, it would be Jean. At the very least, he doubted there was any way they could make each other feel any worse about their situations.\nHathaway was so lost in his own thoughts that he did not immediately realize that Innocent had spoken. \u201cIt\u2019s rather late, James. Are you okay? Is everything alright?\u201d\n\u201c I\u2026 didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d Hathaway suspected that Innocent already knew what he meant, what he wasn\u2019t saying. Everyone at the station knew that Hathaway wasn\u2019t taking Adam Tibbit\u2019s suicide well, even if only a handful of people knew that James felt personally responsible for it.\nJean nodded her understanding. Lewis had voiced his concerns about Hathaway\u2019s response to that poor boy\u2019s death. Ideally, James probably would have preferred to talk to Robbie under ordinary circumstances, but ever since the inspector and Doctor Hobson had started seeing each other, Hathaway had seemed awkward around his former inspector. Innocent still wasn\u2019t exactly sure why this was, but she hoped her boys would work things out between them soon. They relied on each other far too much.\nJames suddenly noticed that Innocent was wearing a rather flimsy dressing gown over a matching (and equally flimsy) nightdress. In some strange way, the outfit made her look\u2026well different\u2014for lack of a better word. More vulnerable. More feminine. Simultaneously more approachable and more distant.\nHe was suddenly aware of just how much he had violated her privacy and felt his cheeks flush with shame. \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I dunno what I was thinking. I should go.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. Come inside.\u201d\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\nInnocent wrinkled her nose in distaste at the state of her living room, as she gestured for Hathaway to sit down. \u201cI apologize for the mess. \u201cMy soon-to-be ex-husband moved out a few days ago, and with everything at work, I haven\u2019t had the time to straighten up.\u201d Nor the inclination.As he took a tentative seat on the armchair across from the sofa, Hathaway glanced around, wondering where this so-called \u201cmess\u201d was supposed to be. Apart from a few day-old newspapers littering the coffee table and three haphazardly-arranged throw pillows on the sofa, the room was immaculate and exactly how he might have imagined Jean Innocent\u2019s flat would look. Simple but elegant with a dark green sofa and matching armchair, dark hardwood flooring, and ivory walls.\u201cCan I offer you something to drink? I could put a kettle on or make us some coffee?\u201d At Hathaway\u2019s non-committal shrug, Innocent thought of something else. \u201cThough I have a feeling, we could both use something stronger.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201c I think I managed to squirrel away some Chianti from my husband\u2019s prying hands. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dSure enough, the wine was just where Jean thought it would be\u2014hidden under the kitchen sink in a box marked \u201ccleaning supplies,\u201d because her slob of a husband was unlikely to look there.Innocent uncorked the bottle and set to work looking for the wine glasses. As she opened the kitchen cabinet, she suddenly remembered that Roger\u2014the bastard\u2014had taken the greater part of their shared glassware when he\u2019d officially moved out two days ago. (Never mind that the set had been a wedding present from her aunt.) All that was left in the cabinet were a few teacups, coffee mugs, and measuring cups.She gave James the nicest of the mugs\u2014and settled for a red polka-dotted mug with a hairline crack at the top.\u00a0 It was a cup that\u2014like Jean herself\u2014had seen far better days.Innocent returned to the living room, handed Hathaway his mug, and settled with her own on the sofa. They sipped their wine in silence for quite some time, but eventually, the quiet got to be unbearable for Jean. She knew how much James must be hurting inside\u2014probably even more than she herself was. \u201cDo you\u2026do you want to talk?\u201dHathaway exhaled sharply but gave no response, and Innocent did not press him any further on that front. Instead, she tried a different approach after another overlong silence had passed. \u201cYou know, that chair you\u2019re sitting on always used to give Roger the most terrible backaches. You\u2019ll be far better off sitting on the sofa. There\u2019s plenty of room, and I promise I don\u2019t bite\u2026much.\u201dJames gave a polite half-smile at the chief superintendent\u2019s feeble attempt at a joke and made to follow her advice. Unfortunately, he moved too quickly, and as he sat down, several droplets of wine splashed up and onto Innocent\u2019s lap.Jean swiftly rose to her feet as Hathaway swore under his breath before all-but-falling-over himself apologizing.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s fine, James. See, none of it\u2019s gotten on the sofa. \u201d The same could not be said for her dressing gown, which she swiftly untied and removed.\u201cAnd as for the dressing gown, well\u2026it\u2019s probably for the best. Roger gave it to me on...our last anniversary.\u201d She cursed, as the tears start to spring in her eyes. She suddenly realized that this was the first time she\u2019d properly cried, since it had all ended.Hathaway immediately engulfed her into something that was probably supposed to be an embrace but was complicated by the fact that he was reluctant to actually touch her. Certainly not while he could see clearly the outlines of her breasts underneath that thin nightdress.Conscious of James\u2019s discomfort, Jean swiftly pulled away from the not-quite-hug. \u201cThank you, James.\u201dHathaway gave a curt nod and quickly looked away. \u201cMa\u2019am, I was about to say that I think I can save it. \u00a0The robe, I mean. \u00a0I think I could maybe get the stains out. If you want. It\u2019s lovely, and it looks nice on you.\u2026I just\u2026it seems so stupid to let bad memories ruin it for you.\u201dInnocent raised her eyebrows in interest. \u201cDo you really think so? I\u2019ve never been able to get red wine out of silk.\u201d\u201c Sometimes, when I was at the seminary, I was assigned to launder the priest\u2019s vestments before Sunday Mass. You\u2019d be surprised how many times a stole falls into the wine chalice and comes out with stains far worse than these\u2014particularly if one is as tall as Fr. Bernard.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take you at your word. And it\u2019s worth a try at least.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have dishwashing liquid, vinegar, and rubbing alcohol, would you?\u201dShe smiled, and nodded.\u2026\u00a0After Hathaway had saved her dressing gown from the rubbish bin, Innocent had stood on her tiptoes and pulled his head down to give him a chaste kiss on the cheek, and he had the misfortune to turn his head ever-so-slightly, causing her to catch the edge of his lips instead. As she tried to move away, he pulled her back to him, readjusting his head so he could kiss her properly. Their lips did not so much meet as collide, their teeth and tongues crashing against each other. The difference in their heights soon proved to be a problem, and he lifted her up, positioning her so that she was half-sitting, half-leaning against the kitchen counter. This also provided him with better access to her thighs.Jean had moved first, nibbling James\u2019s lower lip slightly as she came up for air. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201dIn truth, he wasn\u2019t at all sure about any of this. If he had paused for even a moment to consider it, he would have left Innocent\u2019s flat at once, depression and suicidal urges be damned. But all he could think about at that moment was that he\u2019d felt more human in that moment than he\u2019d felt in months. Whether he was sure of this or not, he needed it.When James voiced this thought aloud, Jean remarked that she had been thinking the exact same thing. He took that as their cue to progress into the bedroom.He never would have suspected that his body would respond in quite this way. From what he had heard, the opposite effect was far more likely. If he felt catatonically impotent in nearly all other aspects of his life, shouldn\u2019t he be similarly unresponsive sexually? And yet, he could not recall ever feeling quite so physically virile.Though he indulged his sexual desires far less often than most of his peers, he was no stranger to carnal urges.\u00a0 He\u2019d had dreams, thoughts, feelings that made his former seminary student blush with shame, even as they\u2019d left him stirred in every way imaginable. On some instances, he\u2019d even acted on these urges with the occasional woman or even more occasional man occasionally venturing into his bed--with both parties typically coming out reasonably satisfied by the experience.\u00a0And yet, he\u2019d never before felt lust in quite the way he was feeling it now. Perhaps because, when it really came down to it, this wasn\u2019t lust at all.\u00a0 It was pure senseless, animal instinct--violent, ravenous, desperate.What was more, he had the sense that Jean shared this rough, bestial instinct and that she needed this just as much as he. There was something no less desperate, no less savage about the way she was clutching him back, about the breakneck roughness of her hips beneath him.It seemed that they were both rushing to find something. Not pleasure. Not when there was something so therapeutic about the painful trails her long fingernails were mapping on his back--each one a stinging verification that he was still alive and aware.But though he was not searching for anything as concrete as pleasure, nor was he pursuing pain--his own or Jean\u2019s alike. He was neither a sadist nor a masochist, and he knew that any satisfaction, brought by Jean\u2019s scratches or his own rough thrusts, was psychologically rather than sexually gratifying.No, this was not about pleasure or pain or pleasure-in-pain. This wasn\u2019t even about release--sexual or otherwise. He knew the moment would come and fade far too fast for him to get any real satisfaction from it, and feeling as he did, he wasn\u2019t even entirely sure he\u2019d be able to recognize that moment when and if it finally came.All he knew was that he was doing this in the hopes of somehow proving that he was still able to do anything at all. That he was still able to perceive pleasure, pain, and release. That he was more than the emptiness he felt inside.Though he knew just how much he would hate himself in the morning, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from chasing what could very well be the last remnant of his humanity.Just as he\u2019d known, it ended far too quickly--one tantalizing moment of clarity, power, even a hint of pleasure before he was left feeling more hollow than before. Even after he\u2019d gone slack, he remained inside her for some time--not out of exhaustion or lingering lust, but rather out of a need to stay connected to something--physically as well as emotionally. The feel of her surrounding him provided him with a much needed reminder that he was still able to feel, experience, connect at the most basic sensory level.Jean let him stay like this for a while, clearly craving the prolonged physical connection just as much as James. Perhaps, she was chasing a memory of times she had lain like this with her own husband, or perhaps she--like Hathaway--nearly needed the sensory affirmation that she wasn\u2019t alone.However, she eventually began to feel trapped under his weight and discreetly indicated her discomfort. Hathaway immediately caught the hint and rolled off of her. He was suddenly and acutely reminded of how rough and senseless he had been with her. \u00a0Her flimsy nightdress was practically in tatters on the floor, but he was really concerned with any physical damage that he\u2019d done. He\u2019d left a fair few bite marks on her neck and breasts--some of them a bit more than shallow--, but what really worried him were the deep imprints his hands had left on various places of her body--the places where he\u2019d held her too tightly, treated her too roughly. He felt almost sick as he thought about the bruises she\u2019d have in the morning.Worse, James could feel his body starting to demand an encore of their copulation, and he knew that this would only be another opportunity for him to cause her more pain. And when it was over, he would  still feel just as empty as he did now.So, he did the only thing he could do, before he pounced on her again. He got out of bed and went off in search of the shower.After taking a moment to figure out how the taps worked, he ensured that the water was cold enough before stepping inside. He had used this same technique often enough while studying for the priesthood, particularly when his unclean thoughts turned to one of his fellow seminarians. As he\u2019d known it would, the frigid water swiftly cooled his ardor, but not without great pain. The deep scratches that Jean had left seared his back like a brand, and even in his agony, he knew that he deserved it\u2014relishing at the thought of sharing some of the pain he\u2019d surely given her. His body started shaking uncontrollably, and he felt tears spring in his eyes. Once he allowed himself to start crying, he found that he could not stop. He was not sure how long he remained there, sobbing unceasingly inside Jean Innocent\u2019s shower, but it seemed an eternity. Eventually, his tears slowed enough for him to see clearly again, and he turned off the water.When he returned to the room, he noticed Jean lying very still in the bed. If he were to guess, he\u2019d imagine she was pretending to be asleep, so that she did not have to face him again. He swiftly changed into his clothes and left.\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\n\nThree Days Later\n\nAt Hathaway\u2019s knock, Innocent raised her eyes from the massive pile of paperwork on her desk and saw the lanky sergeant leaning in the frame of her open door. \u201cAh, James. \u201d She capped her pen and rose to her feet. \u201cDo come in; sit down.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d He avoided her gaze as he took the indicated seat, acutely aware of the fact that this was the first time he had been alone with her since what had transpired between them.\nThough Jean was surely just as uncomfortable as James, she did not let the awkward situation diminish her professionalism. She resumed her seat and immediately began presenting her argument.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sure Inspector Lewis told you by now that he\u2019s thinking quite seriously about retiring, and while we will miss him, it may be time for him to move on with the rest of his life. Now, Robbie and I both agree that you are our first choice for the vacant inspector\u2019s position, provided of course, that you take and pass your OSPRE examinations before the end of the quarter\u2026\u201d\nAs Innocent gestured demonstratively, the sleeve of her jacket shifted slightly, and Hathaway saw a purplish bruise on her forearm. He seized her wrist and pulled her sleeve up further. \u201cDid I do that?\u201d\nThe bites on Innocent\u2019s neck had all-but-disappeared completely through the use of cosmetics, but she had assumed that carefully chosen clothing would cover most of her other injuries. She made a mental note to remedy the situation as soon as possible. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fine, James.\u201d\nHe suddenly felt an odd churning sensation in his stomach at hearing his Christian name from her. The harmless, inconsequential gesture brought back sounds, images he would rather forget\u2014sensations he did not remember experiencing due to his numbness at the time. He instinctively ran his fingers along the bruise, hating himself for putting it there. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not fine.\u201d He released her hand and moved to the window.\nJean tilted her head, considering him. James was so mature and melancholy and brooding that she often forgot that he was still quite young.\u00a0 There was something very innocent about his fears, something that suggested he had very little experience with this sort of thing. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been with someone who\u2019d expressed such concern for any marks he\u2019d left on her--let alone marks as relatively inconsequential as these. She moved over to him and put a reassuring arm on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve had far far worse.\u201d\nHathaway turned sharply to face her. Jean thought she saw a momentary flash of fury on his face that thrilled and terrified her in equal measure. \u00a0 \u201cThat is to say...I didn\u2019t mean. Roge-\u201d Jean couldn\u2019t even will her lips to form the name \u201cWell, my husband favored a rather...physically intense approach. But everything...it was all...He never\u2026\u201d\nShe stopped herself before she could say \u201churt me,\u201d for she knew that wasn\u2019t entirely true. Pain wasn\u2019t just physical after all, and she hurt now in ways that she\u2019d never dreamed possible.\nAnd even physically, her husband had left his fair share of marks upon her, even if they had been consensual. Well, largely consensual. He\u2019d come dangerously close to the line a fair few times, but he\u2019d never actually crossed it. At least not in that way.\nThis line of conversation made her profoundly uncomfortable, so she shook herself and changed the subject. \u201cAnyway, as I was saying, you\u2019ll want to take your OSPRE examinations as soon as you can. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re having any trouble with them, but I would be happy to help you in any way I can\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about promotion. I don\u2019t want it, and even if I did, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d He saw that she was about to object. \u201cNo, don\u2019t\u2026please. I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it.\u201d\nJean took a deep breath and swallowed the protest that had immediately come to her lips. She looked at him for a long moment before asking the obvious question\u2014one to which she was not at all sure she wanted to hear an answer.\u00a0 \u201cThen, why\u2026?\u201d\nHe reached into the inside pocket of his jacket, pulled out an envelope, and handed it to her. \u201cTo give you this.\u201d\n\u00a0Innocent tore the envelope open without any of her customary neatness. She withdrew the letter from inside and skimmed the first three lines several times, before glancing up. Her eyebrows furrowed, first in confusion and then in disappointment. \u201cJames, is this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy letter of resignation? Yeah, I would have thought that was obvious.\u201d\nAn uncomfortably long silence transpired before Innocent finally ended it. She cleared her throat and broached the subject they had both been carefully avoiding. \u201cJames...if this is about what happened the other night\u2026\u201d\nHis reply was so automatic that it made her flinch. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d\nInnocent was still unconvinced. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cPositive. This isn\u2019t about you or about what happened that night.\u201d\nBut it was, though not in the way Jean thought.\nTrue, James had known he had to leave the force even before what had transpired between them. But now, he knew more than ever that he needed to get away from Oxford, from the police, from the people he cared about.\nHis contributing role in Adam Tibbit\u2019s suicide was reason enough to resign, but Hathaway had nevertheless managed to find ways to --if not excuse his actions--to at least understand them. Though he should have anticipated Adam\u2019s possible response regardless, he had not known the boy very well, and none of Adam\u2019s previous behavior had suggested that he was so unstable.\nBut he could think of no adequate explanation or justification for what he\u2019d done with Innocent. Even he\u2019d acted out of genuine attraction, he still would have been ravaged with guilt over committing adultery. But he hadn\u2019t desired Jean specifically, hadn\u2019t even desired sex itself, when it came to it.\u00a0\nAll he had really wanted was to stop the numbness for a moment. All he had really wanted was to briefly feel human again, even though he did not deserve to feel that way. And in order to so, he had used someone he cared about in order to feel better about himself. He had reduced a remarkable human being to the feeling of blood coursing hotly through his veins, to slick sweat on his skin, to his mind clearing and brightening for a fraction of a second before plunging back into darkness.\nAnd even more terrifying was the thought that he had done this--not to a stranger or even an acquaintance--but to a colleague and a friend. Someone he respected as a boss and person alike. Someone with vulnerabilities and need of her own which he\u2019d all-but-ignored.\nSomeone who he\u2019d treated roughly, carelessly as he indulged himself.\nHe had just enough self-respect to doubt that he would hurt her again in exactly that way, but even he could not be completely sure. Moreover, he could imagine countless other ways he could use and harm those he cared about. What if it was Lewis next time? Or Hobson? What if he got to the point where he could no longer control his fear and his anger, and he did something drastic as a result? No, he needed to get away from Oxford, away from the police, away from those he might hurt\u2014Jean Innocent among them.\nJean bit her lip and blew out air through it, a not-uncommon gesture of frustration. Finally, she went with her initial instinct. \u201cThen, you\u2019ve left me with no other choice. I refuse to accept your resignation. Not now at least. Not in this way.\u201d\nShe told herself that she was only trying to stop a very promising career from derailing prematurely, but she knew there was a far more selfish motivation to it than that. This job was perhaps the one thing in her life that was keeping her from going completely mad, providing the stability, predictability, and reliability necessary to counterbalance her own personal turmoil. And James was crucial to maintaining that stability.\nNot only was he a brilliantly talented officer in his own right, he was also one of the few real allies she had. So many of her fellow officers had scrutinized her work, largely because of her gender and her status as an Oxford outsider. Even Robbie\u2014bless his conventional heart\u2014 was occasionally flummoxed about how to behave around her. But she had never experienced those sensations with Hathaway, who showed her genuine respect and the same endearing awkwardness he showed toward everyone else.\nIn his confusion, Hathaway found himself tongue-tied. \u201cBut you\u2026you can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026need. I can\u2019t\u2026 stay here. You should know that as well as anyone.\u201d\nAs he looked at her with those intense James eyes, she could almost feel the ghosts of his lips and his hands\u2014rough and vehement but tinged with desperation and an overpowering sense of sadness.\u00a0 She could feel an echo of the same desperate sorrow within herself.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not disputing that you need some time off.\u00a0 You\u2019ve been through some very difficult cases, and it\u2019s no wonder that they\u2019ve taken their toll.\u201d As Hathaway gave a grudging nod of agreement, Innocent continued. \u201c Besides which, you are long overdue some extended leave. Take six months off\u2014a year even. Spend some quality time with your family, or travel.\u00a0 See the Dome of the Rock and the Hagia Sophia and those other places you\u2019re always wittering on about.\u201d\nHe chewed thoughtfully, considering this. \u201cAnd if I come back after a year and haven\u2019t changed my mind?\u201d\nShe sighed and gave a sad half-smile. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll happily cut you loose and endorse you in whatever you chose to do. I just \u2026I can\u2019t let you make a decision this major without careful consideration\u2026especially if I have in any way, precipitated your resignation. \u201d\nHathaway was about to protest that he had given this careful thought, when a thought occurred to him. Though he\u2019d been miserable for a while and idly considering resignation for months, he hadn\u2019t thought of it seriously until Lewis had brought up retirement. He was not sure how he would cope with the loss of his mentor\u2014his rock of compassion and stability\u2014 who had kept him sane, safe, and alive these past few years.\nBut perhaps, Innocent was right. Perhaps, he was being too hasty in his decision. Maybe with some time off to think and pray and live a more normal life he might develop the strength he needed to do this job without Lewis. In any case, this plan would give him more time to figure out what he planned to do with the rest of his life. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely give it some thought, ma\u2019am. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, James. For everything.

The table was sticky with dried beer and the grains of margarita salt. Heavy bass pounded right between his eyebrows in time with his throbbing headache.He hated this. Being undercover. Protecting a drug dealer on the verge of giving them a network of distributors. He was positioned so that he could see the guy wiping down the bar in the mirror on the far wall. It meant he was sitting close to the stage, though. Real close.He nursed his beer and wished for Tylenol. The bartender caught his eye in the mirror and deliberately smirked, enjoying Robbie's discomfort. Tuesdays and Thursdays were Boy's Nights and for some reason Robbie tended to attract the attention of the young men. Probably because he didn't whoop or drool or generally make an ass of himself reaching out to grab at them as they stripped and danced or moved among the patrons serving drinks. He was safe, he supposed. A kindly father figure, not a threat and willing to simply watch. He tipped, too, and not by shoving dollar bills into their G-strings. It was a small gesture of respect. Just because they were taking off their clothes didn't mean you had the right to touch them intimately. It was something he learned from arresting guys who spent most of their waking moments in clubs like this: regular patrons wait to be invited to touch. Respect. It would keep you off the bouncer's shit list.'Course he was like that with the young women, too. Respectful. He'd been at it for over a couple of weeks, after all, and he was well on his way to becoming a permanent fixture, like the metal dance poles on the stage. Every evening, one or two beers, Tuesday through Saturday.With the young women there was a constant sense of negotiation even if he wasn't interested, as if they were scoping him out to see if perhaps they could convince him that it would be worth his while to go to the back of the club to get off. Drop to their knees for twenty bucks. Lap dance in the private area for fifty. Some of them had a very real sense of desperation, as if they had kids waiting for them at home. He'd just as soon give them the money, really. Others seemed to expect bigger tips. They waitressed with their breasts and if they got his drink order wrong, it was somehow his fault. In any event, most of them reminded him far too much of his daughter for comfort.The guys seemed to understand that if he said 'no' once that evening he wasn't going to change his mind fifteen minutes later. He preferred the men, actually, because he was more comfortable with their reasons for stripping. The men actually seemed to enjoy dancing\u2014they got off on it. They worked out and enjoyed showing off their efforts to an appreciative crowd. And their music choices were far more interesting.Especially this lad. Blond, tall, lithe, and completely oblivious to the audience.Massive Matt, Boner, Kinky Kevin, The Whip, Cowboy Bob\u2014all of the others had fun, playful names and routines. Not this guy.On Tuesdays he was Azrael the Angel of Death. On Thursdays he was the Saint.The first time Robbie saw him, he wore black. Not that it was special, wearing black, but his skin was such a pale gold color, his hair so blond and fine that his face seemed to float against the black backdrop of the stage. He didn't dance\u2014that was the wrong word. He certainly didn't strip\u2014though he slowly removed his clothes as he moved. No, it was more that he became the music.A medley of hard rock oldies\u2014Born to Be Wild, Sympathy for the Devil\u2014the mix sounded professional, portions of songs seguing into the next to make up a four minute set. It was a far cry from the stuttered portions of songs cobbled together by most of the performers. He'd dance four times on Tuesdays, his sets becoming progressively happier. It was as if he was transforming himself from dark to light over the course of the evening.Unlike most of what Robbie had been subjected to, it was riveting watching the man move. A pleasure, in fact.Bit unexpected, that. Feeling that pull, that heat.Robbie didn't delude himself that Azrael had noticed him, though. The young man seemed to be in his own world\u2014not in the druggie way of some of the dancers, but focused in a very real way on the music, as if he played an instrument and that instrument was his body.Robbie wondered if he was classically trained, he had such control over his movements. He'd start off close to the floor, the stage mics would pick up the squeak-rub of his leather motorcycle jacket and leather chaps\u2014it was a kink, Robbie knew, and the largely male audience on Tuesday nights seemed to appreciate the sounds and the slick wet look of the leather under blue stage lights.He wore sunglasses as he danced\u2014they were usually the last to come off, too, as if baring his eyes was too revealing. Most of the other dancers were anxious to make eye contact with the patrons\u2014that's what you did to make tips. Look at me, look at me\u2014yes, I want to fuck you. Look at me. But not this young man. He didn't seem to care. There'd be the slow zip of the jacket, the sudden reveal of a tight black t shirt, the chest-thrust -out strut to center stage, demanding their attention. And it wasn't the man's body so much as his attitude as he stripped. Oh, he was ripped in a wiry way, compact muscles on a lanky frame, his back, shoulders, and thighs hard as if he was an athlete.He knew he was appealing, knew that he was good to look at. Tasty, one of the patrons called him.But his attitude was steamy and dark. Hot and dirty. It reminded Robbie of warm summer nights and tight jeans, of the sort of activities that would get you pummeled if you were anywhere other than Canal Street in Manchester. It made him think of wiping sweat from his forehead, a cold bottle of beer in one hand and his hand tangled in the hair of a bloke swallowing him down.Azrael's dancing reminded Robbie of the days when he was the bad boy. The cute one in the band. The one that everyone wanted.He'd watch the young man pose on the floor, tight black t-shirt and black leather pants, rising up, thighs tensing, the impossible way that Azrael would allow the music to pull him up onto the pole, straddling it and bending backward like a gymnast, blond head to the floor, his crotch moving up and down the metal to the beat of the music. Fucking the pole. He was back lit with a rosy glow so that the line of his body was a perfect arc-groin to head.And then he would flip.It was a startling, gutsy move for a male stripper, and he'd get huge applause, though he didn't seem to care. He'd toss it off, like his t-shirt, and then you could see the barely sculptured abs, the strength hidden beneath plain cotton. Not defined\u2014taut. It made the muscles look like an affectation.Then he would move his hands slowly over his pale skin, his hands lingering just beneath his nipples. A beat. Waiting.Of course someone would shout. And depending on the evening, depending on his mood, depending on the audience, he might give his nipples a bit of attention that made Robbie's mouth go dry for the want of it. Then he'd slowly move his hands to his shoulders, to the sides of his neck, finally supporting the back of his head, tilting it back with an expression of release.Robbie would swear that everyone in the place felt those hands on their necks moving to the sides of their heads. It made him wonder what this young man was like in bed.He hadn't thought about a man in twenty years.And then Azrael would tug off the leather trousers to hoots and demands, his hands rubbing the inside of his hard thighs as if he was grateful to have them off just so that he could move, squatting low and dropping his head, his body seemingly bowed by the sheer weight of the lights.Where other dancers would make their way along the edge of the stage, at that point, thrusting for patrons to put money in their G-strings, Azrael would turn his back and dance center stage. His bare shoulders, back and buttocks would gleam blue from the one overhead spot light in the middle of the dance floor.His hips would move sinuously as if he was approaching a lover and then the set would change, speeding up, and there'd be this powerful twist to face the audience and he'd stride to the front\u2014angry, almost, dangerous\u2014as if he'd caught the audience being naughty.And his arms would go wide like wings and there would be a moment where he seemed poised to take flight. In that moment he'd whip off the glasses, his expression cold and forbidding.The stage would go dark.The audience would go nuts.That moment when the stage went dark was always a problem for Robbie because all it would take would be a single gunshot to take out the guy he'd been assigned to protect. Just one bullet.His relief was palpable when the lights came back on. Azrael never took bows, and tonight was the first time Robbie had ever seen the young man weaving between the patrons with a drink tray. He wore the black t-shirt, tight jeans, and sunglasses.Robbie clutched a twenty-dollar bill in his hand, raising it high above his head. He just wanted\u2014Hell, he didn't know what he wanted. Maybe it was just to make contact, like meeting a celebrity.\"Beer?\"Christ, the man's voice was deep, like chocolate, warm, melting. And he seemed\u2014young. Not quite diminished, more that he was trying not to power his way through the crowd using his height.\"What's on tap?\" Robbie knew damn well what was on tap, but he needed to keep this man talking. He wanted him to say Heineken, Michelob. Wanted to hear every beer they carried. And then he'd ask about mixed drinks. Wines.\"You usually drink Stella,\" said the young man, a faint smile curling the corner of his mouth.\"How do you know what I drink?\"The young man inclined his head slightly, the smile taking over the corner of his mouth. \"I notice things.\"\"Like?\" Have I blown my cover, then? Does he know I'm a cop?Azrael took the twenty, his fingers curling over Robbie's hand, and he leaned close. \"I'll bring you a Stella and I'll come back to talk when the crowd thins out.\"Robbie's mouth went dry. He watched as the young man moved through the crowd, his body swiveling effortlessly so that he barely made contact with a soul.Robbie's hand tingled. He took a deep breath.The next set started. He barely noticed. He was focused on the crowd, waiting for another glimpse of the young man. A bottle of Stella appeared on the table and he rose to see if it had been delivered by Azrael, but the crowd had already closed back, as if mending a rip.Robbie took a long pull from the bottle, watching the bartender in the mirror as things began to slow down. The bartender gave him the finger and turned back to the taps. Cowboy Bob was line dancing in front of him, boots clomping on the floor, the country music twanging and irritating him on a level he hadn't thought possible.Azrael had danced barefoot, Robbie remembered. He wondered, irrationally, whether Azrael was wearing shoes. Wondered what he did during the day. Wondered if he'd come back to talk with the old fart who had taken to sitting on this side of the stage for the last two weeks.It was past time for him to leave. The bartender had come by, given his table a cursory swipe with a dirty rag, and hissed that he was going the fuck home. Robbie congratulated him sarcastically on staying alive for another day and thumbed a text to the car outside that would take the guy to his apartment.He sighed. He could leave now, if he wanted. Massive Matt was up next. Not much of a dancer or stripper, but he took it all off and he was hung like a horse. Robbie had only seen him once, but Matt had received the message loud and clear to keep his cock on the other side of the stage. Robbie might have been a regular, but he wasn't interested in accidents of anatomy. He had his back to the stage, looking through the crowd for Azrael.\"He hates that,\" Azrael said, sliding into the chair beside Robbie. \"People who don't watch.\" His sunglasses picked up the reflections from the stage lights. He set two Stellas on the table. \"Bought you another.\"Robbie reached for his wallet only to have Azrael put his hand out to touch his arm. \"Allow me.\"\nShit.\nRobbie gulped, hard, and then recovered, dusting off memories of how to flirt. He had a feeling they'd all be horribly inadequate.Azrael was giving him this indulgent look, as if he was waiting. As if he was interested.\"Oh, thanks! Christ, sorry. It's\u2014it's the glasses, man. Think you could talk with me without them?\"\"And blow my cover?\"Shit. Robbie bit his bottom lip. No, he knew he didn't look like a cop, not here. \"Your cover? You a spy?\"\"Grad student.\"\"Ah. What\u2019s your major?\"\"Would you believe that I have a theology degree?\"Robbie raised his eyebrows. Hadn't seen that coming. \"Makes sense, I suppose, given your stage names.\"\"Not many people know where 'Azarel' comes from.\"Robbie took a pull of his beer. \"I, uh, had a partner who was well-read. I suppose I remember the name from one of his crosswords.\"\"Oh. I'm sorry. How long were you together?\"\"Eight years, but he's been gone for ten.\"\"Long time to be alone.\" Azrael turned his empty beer bottle this way and that, fiddling. \"Say, I need a cigarette. Come outside with me, keep me company.\"No. Robbie's face fell. Ah, hell, the guy was hustling. He felt disappointed\u2014and a little excited, too, since now he could take advantage of the offer with a bit of impunity. It was still a misdemeanor, but on this side of town everyone turned a blind eye.The young man tapped the top of his hand with a long forefinger. \"Not offering anything except a smoke.\" His fingers danced along Robbie's forearm making him shiver.Robbie finished his beer and heaved himself out of his seat to follow him out of the bar.The night air was warm and smelled of beer and fried food. They sat down on the bench outside the bar, the muffled thump-thump of the music behind them. Robbie leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, and regarded the young man lounging beside him, his arm carelessly thrown over the back of the bench. He knew he wanted to ask how a theology major could become a stripper, knew that the money was probably good, knew the answers to the first ten questions in his head\u2014obvious, really. And he wanted to show that he was different.For some reason, it was important to show that he wasn't the usual run of the mill bar rat.He wanted this young man to like him.Though he sensed that Azrael wouldn't have been interested even in something as innocent as passing the time having a smoke if Robbie hadn't done something extraordinary. He didn't want to bugger up this interlude.\"Did you study ballet?\"The young man leaned forward, the streetlamps reflected in the sunglasses. His lips curved into what might have been a delighted smile if he'd allow it. \"Never been asked that before. No, but I'm flattered you think so.\"\"You're very graceful. Restrained. I thought at first you must be a gymnast,\" Robbie tried to stop the words from tumbling out, but he couldn't. \"But you're too tall\u2014they'd never let you compete. Then I thought, ballet. And now\u2014don't laugh\u2014I'm thinking you must have been trained in something like Tai Kwon do or yoga.\"\"I have a black belt.\" Again, the curve of the mouth.Christ, he had an amazing mouth.Robbie rubbed his palms on his thighs and sat back against the bench. Score one for the old copper. He let the silence grow between them because it was a comfortable one.The young man finished his cigarette and flicked it away, the sparks dancing across the road.\"Littering,\" Robbie said, almost clapping his hand over his mouth for making the observation.\"Are you a cop?\"Well, that's it then. Lie? Truth? \"Yeah.\" He scratched his cheek. \"Name's Lewis. Robbie Lewis. I'd rather not let it get around, being a cop, I mean.\"\"James Hathaway,\" replied the young man. He removed his sunglasses, revealing eyes that gave him an ageless look. \"Understood. Though I think some of the female dancers have figured it out.\"Christ. \"Well, it's important that no one talk about it. I don't suppose you can take care of that? Maybe put the word out that I'm\u2014I dunno\u2014\"They were interrupted by the sound of heels clicking against the pavement and women's voices.James leaned in to Robbie, slid his arms around his neck, and kissed him, saying loudly, \"Don't play with me, Robbie. Tell me what you want.\" He kissed him again and tossed a casual, \"Evening, ladies,\" over his shoulder.Robbie simply stared at him, his face hot and his hands pressed to the man's back. It had been a quick kiss, tobacco and beer and the brush of stubble. One of James's hands cradled his jaw.\"Fuck, take it behind the building, guys.\" The women went into the bar.James's hand dropped, leaving Robbie feeling bereft, but his arm was still around Robbie's shoulders. \"There. No one will ever suspect you now. I've given you a reputation.\"\"Thanks.\" He could barely manage to get the word out. \"I appreciate it,\" he said, more forcefully.James inclined his head, his expression coy. \"Will I see you on Thursday?\"Robbie nodded, dumbstruck.James pulled back and then, very slowly, pressed his cheek against Robbie's, brushing his nose against his temple and breathing hot into his ear. He hummed agreeably. \"Let's continue this on Thursday, then. Goodnight, Robbie.\"\"'Night, James.\"James turned at the door. \"You didn't call me 'Jim.'\"\"Should I?\"\"Never.\"Robbie rose, put his hands into his pockets and jingled his keys. He looked away, smiled, and as he turned to go, he glanced back. James was watching him. He had his hands in his pockets too. He bounced on his toes and ducked his head, smiling to himself.Robbie's breath caught. He huffed a laugh. \"Better go.\" He paused, not wanting to leave.James met his eyes. \"Thursday, then.\"\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\n\"You fuckin' did that on purpose!\" The woman at the bar wiped at her chest, while the bartender smirked at her from beneath a bandana wrapped around his head and mopped at the spill of gin puddling on the bar top. \"Motherfuckin' asshole,\" she muttered. \"Get me another.\"\nRobbie rubbed his forehead. He could hear the dancer bitching at the bartender from his post at the corner of the stage. He hated Wednesdays. Two of the women dancers looked young enough to be very underage and it made him squirm. He wondered why the hell his division was concentrating on drugs when these\u2014well, they looked like children!\u2014were up there parading around in short schoolgirl skirts and strutting stuff that looked like it still needed to ripen, in his opinion.  Made him uncomfortable. But they'd checked before the undercover operation began: every woman up there was of age. Still.He worried that seeing it on parade like that would push someone into trying it on with a kid. Thought about saying something to the dancer at the bar.On Wednesdays, he'd turn toward the stage, keeping the bartender in sight by watching the mirror along the wall, and he'd sip his beer. Felt embarrassed for even being there. He knew the location of every hanging light on that stage because he was looking beyond the ladies. Knew the exit to the alley was behind that black curtain.  He had worked Vice back in the day, he knew that 'exotic dancing' wasn't the money-making job these women hoped for to fund their college education. Or their longed-for breast enlargements.He didn't like the usual Wednesday crowd either. Oh, it was ladies night, so it was a mixed bag\u2014men and women--but the men who came to watch on Ladies Night were a little skeevy.There was a hen party tonight, too\u2014no, bachelorette party, he reminded himself. He'd been in the States now ever since he left the British Virgin Islands\u2014couldn't bear to go back to Oxford, not after Val.He recalled Val joking about 'dirty dancing'\u2014she'd never seen a male stripper, always hoped she'd get to, and would he mind doing a turn or two? Pretend to be Patrick Swayze? Give us a sexy shoulder roll, Robbie and drop your jeans! He remembered her laughing when he did\u2014Val had a great laugh. Christ, his mates were stunned when he took up with her. A woman! But his best friend.Hadn't had a friend like Val in years.He saw a guy escorting a woman\u2014had to be his wife, they had an 'established couple' air about them. Probably looking to spice up things in the bedroom. He would have been mortified to take Val to a strip club as he never went himself unless it was part of his job. Not something a happily married man does, now is it?Morse went, though, a time or two. Said it was as good a place as any for an unattached bloke to get a drink.A few more women came in, laughing and carrying on. He wondered what the hell women were doing watching other women strip and then he caught them enjoying themselves\u2014laughing and bouncing in their seats, their arms draped around each other--well, that was all right, then. Good for them, trying it on. I kissed a girl and I liked it\u2014wasn't that a song?Although, maybe they just got the night wrong and had come in hoping to see male strippers. Or maybe the happy couple was gay. Or maybe these women were just curious. Consenting adults, after all. Robbie wanted to tell them to try it all, enjoy it all\u2014just be safe about it. Condoms, safe words.Protect your feelings most of all. Don't confuse lust and love.Morse used to say he was all in favor of consensual sex. He just wished more people would consent to having sex with him. Still made Robbie chuckle, thinking of that, knowing that Morse, like everyone else, was looking for love.Or the illusion of love. Whatever.Anyway, it was hardly his business what these young women were up to. The male patrons were paying a bit too much attention, though, to the girl-on-girl lip-locks, and he hoped that the guys wouldn't get out of hand. The regular bouncer wasn't there and he hoped the bartender wouldn't have to call the cops.The other cops, he reminded himself. He sipped his beer. Not many coppers would complain over getting an undercover job watching a bartender in a strip bar.Not that he was complaining. He just wasn't enjoying it all that much. Not really. He wanted it to be Thursday.He grinned and looked at the table, feeling a bit silly. He had a date.He, Robbie Lewis, had a date.Well, not really. James (Azrael the Angel of Death) was probably having him on, flirting to have something to do. He'd only kissed him to make the two of them look like an item. Most likely he kissed guys all the time.No, no. James didn't seem like the sort. Whatever else he was\u2014and he seemed to be an unusual guy\u2014he wasn't the sort. For all his display of skin on stage, he seemed clothed in mystery and shadows.Robbie snuffled a laugh. Christ. Mystery and shadows. What an imagination. So, a date.Yeah, he thought, that was unusual. His eyes widened as his sipped his beer, grinning.\"Happy to see me?\" said the female dancer from the bar, sitting beside him, and setting her drink on the table.\nWhat the hell?\nHe raised his eyebrows. He had no idea why she was sitting there with him. He certainly didn't want her there, sitting in his line of sight. Name was\u2014he searched his memory\u2014Astrid. Emphasis on the first syllable.\"You're here every night,\" she began, tapping long, elaborately manicured artificial nails on the tabletop. \"Got a favorite girl?\" She smiled, knowingly, leaning in, her breast brushing against his elbow. Her breath smelled of gin. She had to be in her late thirties.Robbie recovered quickly. \"Oh, well, they're all a bit young for me.\"\"But I'm not,\" James slid onto the empty chair on the other side of Robbie. He took Robbie's hand and interlaced their fingers. \"How's it going?\"She gave James a sour look. \"Oh, for crying out loud, Angel.\" She turned to address Robbie. \"Look, I don't care what you two get up to, but if you're having a 'thing' then be fair and give my girls a break. If you're taking up this table and you're not interested in women, you're keeping them from getting tips by sitting so close.\"Robbie sighed, looking up at the bartender in the mirror. The guy flashed him a leering grin and shook his head, as if to say, 'Your problem now, buddy.'Then Robbie focused on James\u2014who smelled like he'd just showered and brushed his teeth and whose hair still looked damp and soft and gold in the light\u2014who was still holding his hand, and who shouldn't have been there on a Wednesday.He couldn't help but smile at James who smiled back. \"Isn't it your day off?\"James raised their joined hands and rubbed Robbie's knuckles gently against his lips before sharing a look with him and setting their hands back onto the table.Christ, that mouth. The corners of the man's lips curled up slightly like a villain's moustache.\"Tell you what,\" said Robbie to Astrid, wanting her to disappear. \"I like this table. Like the angle, like seeing the door in the mirror.\"The woman arched a penciled-in eyebrow. Waiting.\"Just like to keep an eye on things, get a bit of advanced notice in case people come in that I don't care for. So, here's what I'll do. Where I'm from, the lassies take up a collection each time before they dance. They take around a beer mug, collect a pound coin. Oh, roughly a dollar per dance.\"\"Seriously? Are you shitting me?\"Robbie shrugged. \"I don't make the rules. You say they're your girls, can you collect for them? Dollar per dance?\" Robbie cast his gaze sideways and saw the subtle tilt of James's head, as if to say: Okay, then. Might work.Robbie's heart warmed. It had been a long time since he'd been able to communicate with someone by using a gesture as clever as a glance.\"Five dollars?\" Astrid pushed against him and that was no soft breast against his elbow: it felt like molded plastic, silicone gone hard.\"Two.\" He calculated the current exchange rate. \"Two. Might be more for certain girls,\" he thought of a young woman who always seemed near tears. \"I might want to spread what little I have around, share the wealth, so to speak. But I keep this table. Deal?\"\"Fine.\" She rose, her fingertips still pointedly on the table. Waiting.\"One more thing. Give some thought, would you, to the schoolgirl look. Pervs don't tip.\" Robbie slid over forty bucks. \"I don't stay as long on Wednesdays.\"She pursed her lips, giving him a sour look before crumpling the bills in her fist. She strode quickly away toward the backstage area.\"'Angel?'\" Robbie asked, inclined his head and looking at James from the side.\"Nickname.\" He shrugged, releasing Robbie's hand. \"I hope you don't mind. Holding your hand like that. She'll give them the money. In case you were wondering.\"\"I know. I'm a good judge of character.\" Robbie looked away, rolling his eyes at his own arrogance. \"What I mean is\u2014\"\"\u2014I know what you mean. And you are.\"\"I just want to make sure that I have enough to pass on to\u2014I think her name's Jenny?\u2014that she gets something more.\"\"She's gone. No, no\u2014she's okay.\" James put his hand on Robbie's forearm. \"She got into a Catholic Charities program with her baby.\" He took back his hand, as if he hadn't intended to touch Robbie, and rested his elbows on the table, his hands folded in front of him. He cocked his head, waiting for a response.\"That's good, then. I was\u2014worried about her, I guess.\"\"Do you always take responsibility for the strippers you like?\"\"Exotic dancers. And no, I don't.\" Robbie sipped his beer, a little irritated that James might see him as a soppy old man. Or an easy touch. Well, he wasn't, not at all. His gaze swept over the stage\u2014rose colored lights and a woman writhing on the stage floor to a dissonant rap number\u2014and he wondered why it was only vaguely arousing.But sitting next to James, whose knee was barely touching his, whose shoulder not quite touched his? Hell, he was half-hard just sitting there looking at the man in profile.\"You have a sense of decency,\" James observed.Oh, that's a cock block, Robbie thought.James sipped his beer and looked at Robbie over the glass, meeting his eyes.Robbie's breath caught and held. Not a cock block, then. Not at all.James's gaze wavered then, and he swept his eyes over the stage, the mirror, the bar. \"It's a bit unusual in this environment. Decency.\" When his eyes came back to Robbie's, he seemed more in control.Glad I'm not the only one feeling this\u2014whatever the fuck this is. Robbie leaned his shoulder into James's shoulder as if he was casually stretching and felt the hard muscle against his flesh.James didn't move, but\u2014was he blushing? Some trick of the lights?Robbie felt his face flush. Could reach over, put my hand on his thigh, see if this ends right now.  He took a deep breath to muster up his courage, and glanced in the mirror. Another group of women entered the bar, all giggles and high heels. He was supposed to be working. His eyes snapped to the bartender, still safe behind the bar.\"Guess you see all types. How long have you been working here? And why aren't you doing something with your day off?\" Robbie didn't want to drive the man away, but the bar was getting progressively harder to monitor with the number of people showing up for this damn bachelorette party.And he really didn't want to feel this way when he had a job to do. Distracted and hot.\"I've been here for five or six weeks.\" James ignored the other question and looked into the mirror. \"Nice view of the bar.\"The hairs went up on the back of Robbie's neck. \"It is.\" He dragged his gaze from the mirror to the young man beside him. James wore a dark long sleeved shirt, jeans. Non-descript, almost sloppy, and unaccountably close.James moistened his lips, chewing on the bottom a bit as if a dirty thought occurred to him, the corner of his mouth edging up.Robbie stared. Could watch him do that for hours. Like to nibble that lip myself. He let out a sharp breath and then remembered why he was there. He tore his eyes away and looked at the mirror. Yeah, the fucker at the bar was still there serving watered down drinks, but now he was talking to someone. Really talking with someone that Robbie had never seen before. Huge guy in a long leather jacket.\nAh, Christ.\nRobbie glanced at James, who was watching the mirror with interest.\nShit. What if James is involved? No, no, no. Not him. Please, God, not him.\n\"I'll get us another,\" James said, rising to go to the bar.He was gone before Robbie could stop him\u2014his hand raised to grab James's arm.The bartender suddenly scratched his head, their signal that yes, this big guy at the bar was one of the big distributors in the drug ring.He didn't even see how James managed to get to the bar\u2014it was like watching a ninja. He was suddenly there, next to this guy the size of a refrigerator: broad, tall, muscle-bound. His eyes were tiny in a fleshy face, but it didn't stop him from looking directly into the mirror as if he could see right into Robbie's soul.And there was James, right next to the guy, talking with him as if he knew him.\nFuck.\nRobbie thumbed a number on his phone beneath the table, sending an alert to the plainclothes cop monitoring from across the street, barely taking his eyes off the mirror. He watched in horror as James leaned against the man's shoulder, just for a moment, and then turned to disappear into the crowd again.All Robbie could see was a mass of people standing at the bar\u2014women sitting at tables. How big was this fucking wedding party going to be, anyway\u2014was every single lady in the county here?\"The thing with mirrors is that you can be seen as well,\" James breathed into Robbie's ear. He set their Stellas down on the table. His hand came up to Robbie's jaw and Robbie dragged his gaze from the mirror to James's eyes. \"He's still there.\" James's eyes were blue green in the dim light of the club; he seemed to be looking just past Robbie, though his long fingers were warm against Robbie's face. He leaned close and whispered hot almost against Robbie's mouth, \"He sees us.\"I don't fucking care if he sees us! Robbie wanted to yell. Don't know what the hell is going on here, and\u2014James was kissing the corner of his mouth, eyes open and focused. He was watching the fucking mirror!Robbie started to draw back, but James's hand moved to the back of his neck, holding him fast and strong. He whispered against his mouth: \"Please. Let me. Just\u2014there. He's lost interest. Homophobe.\"James pressed his forehead to Robbie's and Robbie heard James swallow audibly. His hand was still at the back of Robbie's neck.\"James,\" Robbie pulled back, checking out the mirror. Refrigerator man was still there and\u2014thank god\u2014there was the plainclothes cop and his partner at the bar. \"What the fuck was that about?\"James took a pull on his beer, not looking at him. \"He asked why you were staring. I told him you were my boyfriend and you were the jealous type.\"\"What?\" Robbie stared, his mouth pursed and angry. \"You could've been hurt.\"James shrugged, uncaring and not looking at him. He acknowledged the words with a slight nod. \"He was far more interested in you than me. I was keeping you safe.\"Him keeping me safe. Be a cold day in hell when a civilian\u2014a theology student!\u2014saves me. Me, a cop for over thirty years.  \"Do you know him well?\"James raised his eyebrows, staring at the table. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \"I don't know him at all. Never saw him before tonight.\" He met Robbie's eyes.Fine.  Robbie could see a truth there, and something else, too, that wasn't quite truth. He didn't want to examine it too closely because now he saw that the young man wasn't nearly as young as he first thought. Mid-thirties, he reckoned, and for some reason, it made him feel better knowing that James was a bit older than he'd first thought. He could see the fine lines creasing his forehead and the faint laugh lines at the corners of his eyes not hidden by expert stage makeup. He could see the furrows deepening between his eyebrows as he regarded Robbie. \"I don't do\u2014this. Not usually. Not ever, actually.\"\"What? You mean save people?\" Robbie said, irritably.\"Oh, I save people all the time,\" James said, offhanded and casual. He absently picked at the edges of the beer bottle label, his gaze fixed on the mirror. \"He's leaving. Has company.\"Robbie turned to watch. There was a plainclothes cop on either side of the guy, escorting him outside.Man the size of a fridge, there was no way that those two cops alone could keep him down if things went south. He had a bad feeling about this. \"You need a cigarette?\" Robbie finished up his beer as he rose.James tossed back his beer, smoothly rising and moving quickly to his side. \"Let's go out the back, come around the front. Less noticeable.\"Robbie was already moving to the exit he knew behind the curtain, confident, alert. And protected.Hadn't felt that way, really felt that way, in years. James had his back.And he really had no idea who this guy was. Maybe being a theology student put him on the side of the angels. He sure as hell hoped that the nickname held true.James edged past him, and took his hand, holding it up like he'd won first prize as they fled through the women's dressing room.Hardly a dressing room, Robbie thought, more of a makeup space. No one noticed except one dancer who hooted, \"Way to go, Angel-baby!\"\"You have admirers,\" Robbie said, as the back door slammed behind them. He wondered how he stacked up among them.It was dark, the night sky edging into magenta at the horizon. The warm outside air was a relief, though it smelled of garbage, urine, vomit. He heard the wet thwap sound of someone being serviced behind the dumpster. One of the young female dancers, wearing a Japanese robe, was talking on her phone and smoking a joint. The smell of pot was in the air, heavy and strong.James dropped his hand and hurriedly lit a cigarette, continuing to move along the side of the building to the front, Robbie close behind. Their shoes crunched on the loose gravel in the small parking lot. A line of pink neon lights buzzed above them, a counterpoint to the thumping bass in the bar.One of the acts inside the joint used an air horn as part of their act. Robbie stopped, startled, and listened for a moment. Footsteps. Coming closer. He saw the dark, hulking outline of the guy in the bar.James pressed his hand to Robbie's shoulder and pushed him against the wall.He stood solidly in front of Robbie, one hand on his shoulder, the other bringing the cigarette to his lips. Robbie's hand went to James's waist, to hold him there, wanting them both to disappear against the painted cinderblock of the building, just a few more anonymous figures in the darkness.James's face was close, he didn't even seem to be breathing, he was so still. His eyes glittered in the dim light; he leaned forward, pressing his closed mouth against Robbie's, hard, as if he wanted to force it to open.Robbie almost whimpered. Not the fucking time for this!  James was insistent, the footsteps coming closer, pressing against his lip hard enough to hurt. Robbie opened his mouth, getting a lungful of cigarette smoke, and he began coughing, hard, almost choking. He bent over.\"Hey,\" James whispered loudly, \"take it in and hold it down into your lungs. Yeah. C'mon, man, don't waste it.\"Robbie's eyes watered, he continued to cough and sputter.  Christ.  Not like they were smoking\u2014oh. He was a fool. The heavy footsteps passed slowly, the man in the bar heading for the parking lot. Where were the other cops?  He had to find the plainclothes cops.James pressed him against the building, bringing his lips close to his ear. \"Don't move. He's coming back.\" James raised his voice, seductive. \"That's it, man. And I'll do you for twenty-five because I like you, but we gotta go to my car out front. Don't want an audience.\"The footsteps slowed, as if the guy was taking in the scene behind the building. Meandering as if he owned the place.\nMaybe he did.\nRobbie closed his eyes and pulled James nearer, putting his head against his shoulder, and said, as dreamily as he could muster despite the line of sweat running down his back, \"Yeah, yeah. Can I have some more. Stronger pot than I'm used to.\" He glanced at James and felt the man subtly relax into him. Been a long time since he had been undercover, but he knew how the game worked.He was just surprised that James knew.And surprised as hell that James was as hard as he was.\"There's more in my car.\" James kissed him.They heard the footsteps walk quickly away, a hiss of disgust. \"Fucking faggots.\"They waited a beat and then they were on the move, Robbie leading the way, James following.\"No,\" whispered James softly. \"Too fast.\"\"I want some more of that and I want you. Now.\" Robbie said, knowing he was loud enough to be heard as he came around the corner of the building, his feet sliding to a stop in the gravel. He paused, glancing around the corner before reaching back to grab James's hand to pull him along. \"Where's your car?\" His voice sounded anxious, not stoned. He looked up the street and saw the guy just a few yards from them, his bulk a good match for the SUV he climbed into.James put his arms around Robbie's neck and turned them both around, nuzzling into his neck so that Robbie could see the back of the car as it slowly drove off.\"Did you get the plates?\" James rubbed the top of his head against Robbie's cheek.\"I did.\" Robbie waited for James to back away, waited for an explanation.James pulled him closer.Robbie huffed a laugh and put his arms around the man's waist. He needed to find out what had happened to the other cops, but until the car turned the corner, he was still in sight and this wonderful, inventive man was still vulnerable.Yeah, and if that hulking guy pulled a gun and took a shot from the SUV as he went around the corner, James would be the one to go down first. He resisted Robbie's efforts to turn their bodies, though. James held him in place, his strong legs braced on the outside of Robbie's. \"Don't, Robbie. He can still see us.\"Robbie took a moment and stared at James, who was giving him this bemused, indulgent look. He took James's chin in his hand, brushing his thumb against the jawline, tracing the line of an old scar. He kissed the scar there, pressing gentle, tiny kisses along that swash on his sturdy chin on the way to that perfect mouth.James made a little sound, grinding into him, and Robbie felt giddy, pulling back, amazed that this\u2014whatever the hell it was\u2014was happening to him. Amazed that he was letting it. He heard the SUV speed up to take the corner at the end of the block, but he couldn't take his eyes off James.The younger man was staring at his mouth, his eyes half-shut, his head slightly tilted.We need to talk, Robbie thought. No way is this man a stripper. He gripped James's upper arms, hard, giving him a curt nod, as James took a step back. Robbie wrenched his attention away, looked across the street, at the empty Toyota that the plainclothes cop and his partner used, and looked at the door to the bar where the asshole bartender was that he was supposed to protect.\"I'll check the bar,\" James said, heading for the front door.Robbie started for the street, afraid of what he might find in the car. \"James.\"The young man turned as he walked.\"Be careful.\"James gave him a nod, whipped open the door\u2014\u2014and the front of the bar exploded.\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\n\"James!\" Robbie picked himself up from the pavement, already moving toward the heavy smoke billowing from the building. No flames. Too much smoke. Not an explosion, then. Canister or two of tear gas? And\u2014smoke bombs? Bloody hell. He pulled his shirt up to cover his mouth and nose as he quickly made his way to the entrance to the building. The bartender, who was his responsibility, was still in there and there'd be hell to pay if the man did a runner. But more important than that, James was in there, and Robbie had no way of knowing if he had been hurt.Robbie pushed against the crowd swarming out of the bar. Frightened and panicked, people were shoving their way out\u2014stumbling, crying, disoriented\u2014but the bouncer and others were bodily moving them out from the doorway so that no one was trampled. The door was hanging from one hinge. He hesitated, thinking he might have better luck getting inside if he went around to the back, and he started in that direction, but first he needed to check\u2014 \u2014The Toyota belonging to the plainclothes cops was gone. He noticed that a couple of the dancers were leading people across the street to stand in the empty parking spot. Bugger. Still holding the edge of his shirt up over his nose and mouth, Robbie stopped a woman he'd seen in the bachelorette party group. \"Anyone badly hurt in there?\" Protect and serve, first and foremost. \"Don't think so. Plenty pissed off, though.\" She wiped her eyes with a fist, leaving a smear of mascara on her pale face. \"Smells like shit.\" \"Get your friends together and get away from the smoke.\" He could hear sirens in the distance. \"If anyone's having trouble breathing\u2014\" \"\u2014Tell the woman in black sequins over there, she's a nursing student,\" interrupted Astrid, the female dancer from the bar who had taken Robbie's money earlier. She took the woman's arm and pointed to the growing group of bar patrons standing across the street. \"We're doing triage,\" she explained to Robbie. She put a hand on her hip and regarded him shrewdly. \"First responder?\" \"Concerned citizen.\" Robbie dropped his ersatz shirt-mask and looked past her toward the back of the building where two of the dancers were standing holding baseball bats, as if they were protecting the back door from potential looters. Not going in the back, then. Astrid followed his gaze. \"It's not the first time we've had an incident. Knife fights, robberies.\" She peered at his eyes. \"You seem fine. Go over there till the fire department and the EMTs get here.\" Approaching sirens\u2014couldn't be more than a quarter mile away. More dancers were coming around from the back, pulling patrons away from the building. The night was shrouded in the heavy fog typical along the coast; the acrid smell of chemicals and smoke was suspended in the moist air. \"I need to get inside.\" She reached to grab his arm, but he took a step back. \"Sorry, it's just that James\u2014uh, Angel, was right there by the door when it happened. He hasn't come out.\"She looked at him then, really looked at him, as if assessing his troublemaking potential or perhaps she reckoned he was a cop. He didn't care\u2014he was going in, with or without her permission. She may have seen his determination, because she gave an exasperated sigh and waved her hand at the bouncer. \"Let him go back in.\" He nodded his thanks, pulling his shirt back up over his nose and mouth. As he did so, the night air slicked the bare portion of his middle, making him feel clammy and overly exposed. He pushed and shoved his way inside, struggling to get in while others were trying to get out. He tripped over a toppled chair--the bar was pitch black inside except for the eerie flashes of glowing pink neon coming in from the open doorway. Someone must've cut the electrical inside. Premeditated, that. He elbowed his way to the bar, caught off guard by the overwhelming sense of relief he felt when he finally laid eyes on James. Seemingly unharmed, James was holding a bar rag over his mouth with one hand while gripping the upper arm of the bartender with the other, roughly propelling him toward the door. As Robbie took in the details of the scene, he saw that the taps had been opened behind the bar and water was overflowing the sink onto the floor. He also noted that the bartender had a bandanna tied over his nose and mouth and...goggles. The bartender had planned it. The fucking bastard had planned it! James shoved the bartender toward Robbie. \"I'll make sure all the dancers got out.\" And he disappeared back into the mist that hung in the darkened strip club. Robbie dragged the bartender out into the night, hoping that he'd see a police car outside the building and was rewarded with a vision: an armada of emergency response vehicles, lights flashing, police personnel in riot gear. Christ. The media was just beginning to arrive. If he could get the bartender out of sight, they might be able to convince the rest of the drug ring that the guy had evaded custody. They stopped beside an ambulance, away from the cameras. Robbie couldn't spot a police unit he was familiar with, though. Called in as a bomb, Fire-Rescue Units and an alphabet soup of inter-agency police response had showed up: CHP, OBPD, SDSO. And the plainclothes team from his division was MIA. As was James. The response seemed out of proportion to a mere drug ring and his skin prickled with foreboding. Something wasn't right here, and it wasn't just the business with James. Because James could have dropped a canister himself, couldn't he? Easy enough to do. Set it off as he entered. He might not have thought Robbie would make it inside. Might even be part of the drugs distribution chain himself. Hell, James might even be the leader. That would explain a lot. His willingness to snog a cop. Maybe he wanted to give the old guy a thrill, make him feel like James Bond for a night so he'd never suspect. Maybe he was planning to get rid of the bartender entirely. Or, maybe his objective was getting the bartender out and into the public eye, letting the rest of the drug ring know that one part of the snake's head had been cut off. They'd all head to ground for sure then. Yeah, pretend to frog march the bartender toward the front door, hand him over to the unsuspecting old fool of a cop and escape out the back using the ruse of checking for the other dancers when they were all outside already. Robbie and the bartender in front of the camera crews...that would work. The dancers would let James go, too, because he was one of them. And Robbie had been taken in. It surprised him, how much that hurt. What would be worse, Robbie wondered, losing the fucking bartender or losing a man that he was beginning to trust? A man he might come to call friend? Because there was something to that, that security in knowing that you'd found someone you might be able to trust. Someone to watch your back. A partner. Perhaps even more. He hadn't had thoughts like those in years. Right, well, at least he had the bartender in hand. Didn't look as though he was going far, either\u2014water-soaked bandanna and goggles, for Christ's sake. \"You all right?\" \"Like you give a fuck.\" Robbie sighed. He cared enough to want the man healthy enough to testify, but that was about it. He wanted to ask if James was part of it, if the bartender and James had cooked up this little scheme. He dragged the bartender with him toward one of the red Fire-Rescue ambulances, dodging a news crew. \"Give us a minute, okay?\" Robbie brushed off the grasping medical personnel with a growl, cursing himself for being an idiot\u2014what had he been thinking, being distracted by a bloke like James and expecting\u2014what? That James was actually interested in him? Either James was in on this or he had to be law enforcement. Please, let him be a cop. And what the hell had happened to his backup? Had the men in plainclothes followed the big guy in the SUV? Was it too much to hope that something, anything, had gone right? \"The plainclothes unit isn't here.\" James's hand was heavy on his shoulder, coming up from behind him, doing his sneaky ninja, pussyfooting around thing again, his body pressed close. His voice was barely above a whisper, but Robbie wasn't sure if it was the closeness or the deep vibration of James's voice that gave him the shivers. His involuntary reaction to James pissed him off. He wasn't a bloody teenager. He'd been sitting in a strip club for weeks, what was it about this tall and lanky man that was getting the better of him? Distracting, that's what it was, and he didn't like it when he had a job to do. Robbie caught himself before he ripped into James to demand an explanation. Wouldn't do him any good to antagonize the only person who'd been of help so far\u2014if help was what it was. But his impatience showed, because James seemed taken aback by his expression. \"We need to talk, Robbie\u2014I know\u2014but he can't go back into DEA custody without getting the once over from the EMTs.\" James pulled a few cable ties from his pocket and hesitated, his eyebrows raised as he looked at Robbie. Oh, now he's checking with me? Who the bloody hell does he think he is, anyway? And what's this now about the Drug Enforcement Agency? \"He set off those canisters?\" At James's nod, he continued, \"then he poses a flight risk despite being in protective custody. My custody, understand. I'd say cuff him.\" James quickly looped the cable ties over the protesting bartender's wrists. This wasn't going right at all, in Robbie's mind. It was a drug ring, for Christ's sake. Routine. If there was a second unit assigned, why didn't he know about it? Should have been a phone call or an email, at the very least. And how did James fit in? \"The ties are too tight,\" whined the bartender. \"Till I hear otherwise, you're still in protective custody and it's allowed,\" Robbie hissed, bristling. \"Hell, they've brought the fucking bomb squad out for this stunt! Bloody terrorist.\" And, given this response, he might as well be an insurgent, for all that, though Robbie doubted it. The bartender was a weasel, but he didn't seem the bomber type. Still, it's always the quiet ones. He gave James another look. Quiet one if ever there was. James smiled slightly at Robbie, arching an eyebrow in an appreciative way. \"Terrorist? I like that. Gives us a place to stash him, too, for two weeks, if need be. Should be just enough time to\u2026\" His voice trailed off as he searched for a likely looking EMT and inconspicuously flashed a badge to skip ahead in the line. Law enforcement then! Robbie had never been so happy to see a badge in his life. He caught James's eye and grinned, his eyebrows flickering up because he was delighted. Bloody hell! But it was the look that James gave him then that made his heart pound. 'Yes, I'm like you,' it said. 'Trust me,' it said. \"This is a suspected terrorist\u2014\" James said to the EMT. \"I'm not a fucking terrorist! I'm a drug dealer!\" \"A little louder,\" Robbie said, sarcastically. \"I don't think the people across the street heard you. I\u2014well, we, wouldn't want you to get hurt before we get a chance to find out who you were planning to run off with.\" \"And where,\" put in James. He glanced at Robbie, the corners of his mouth curling up. \"Never know who might be out there with a gun looking for you,\" added Robbie, for good measure. The bartender narrowed his eyes, as if considering this. \"Actually, that's a fair point. It's best if we get you into that ambulance now. For your own safety and that of the bystanders.\" James cast a look at the chaos around them. \"You can't be seen.\" He glanced at Robbie. \"We'll have to pretend that he made it out. And we can't appear to be anything other than what we were pretending to be.\" \"What's that, then? Male stripper and his besotted rough trade?\" James arched an eyebrow over eyes that were beginning to pink up. He gave an exasperated sigh. The sight of that cold metal badge had warmed Robbie's heart. He glanced at James, who was wiping his eyes with his fingertips. \"You need to get that seen to.\" \"And I will,\" James blinked as he sniffed and wiped his eyes. \"Let's just get this settled.\" Stubborn sod, Robbie thought. He handed off the bartender to the EMT who put an orange blanket around the man's shoulders as they hustled him into the vehicle. \"Keep an eye on him, he's slippery.\" \"Fuck you.\" Robbie shrugged. James has a bloody badge! He ran his fingers through his hair and dropped his hands to his sides. He was more than ready for an explanation. \nHe came back to stand beside James, who was watching as an armored and helmeted crew piloted a small remote camera into the building. A news crew was videotaping the proceedings. \"They don't need to do that,\" James said, blinking his eyes. \"I checked. It's clear. Nothing obvious, at any rate. Trace evidence, perhaps.\" \"Are you an expert?\" \"In some things. Not in others.\" James said dryly. He wiped beneath his eyes with his fingertips, blinking. \"Rubbing your eyes will make it worse,\" Robbie said gently. \"Not a weapons expert, then.\" \"Hardly. Look\u2014\" \"\u2014You're not going to ask me to table the conversation, are you?\" said Robbie, aping the managerial idiom favored in his division.James drew back aghast, his eyes wide. \"I'd never use a noun as a verb.\" Robbie hid his smile by looking down. So, there's the grad student, then. He looked up to see James staring at him, the ghost of a smile lurking before he ducked his head, as if he'd shown too much. It was an endearing moment of weakness and Robbie sighed, a little sad, when he saw James put his guard up again. It reminded him of the expressionless mask James wore on stage\u2014unperturbed and aloof. For all of the clothing that James had divested himself of on-stage, it was that mask that Robbie most wanted him to remove.\"I'll arrange to have him picked up,\" said James. \"No, I'll call my division.\" James's mouth tightened. \"Given that he tried to escape, wouldn't it be more prudent to have the DEA take him in?\" Robbie settled back on his heels, his hands in his pockets. \"I really could do with that explanation, James. But go ahead, make the call.\" James straightened and reached out, his hand grasping Robbie's upper arm; he nodded before he let go to rub his eyes again. While the EMT treated the bartender\u2014flushing his eyes and skin with water and applying ointment to his eyes\u2014Robbie called in to the station, asking the desk sergeant to check the whereabouts of the plainclothes detail. James was on his phone too. He motioned for Robbie to get treated next, but Robbie waved in a few of the young ladies from the bachelorette party whose eyes were swollen shut and streaming tears. \"I'm gonna sue The Body Shop,\" fumed a young woman, pressing a wet cloth to her reddened face. \"Fucking ruined my shoes.\" \"Shut up, Jesse,\" said her friend. \"Gawd. Like, this is a disaster. We'll be on the news!\" Robbie tried to ignore the media and slumped against the ambulance, eavesdropping as James arranged for the bartender to be taken back into custody. It didn't seem to be going well. \"He was a witness under protective custody of the OBPD and they are not equipped to deal with someone who just set off incendiary devices with intent to harm. Why, yes, I do think a detail should come to pick him up from the address I just gave you, that's why I\u2019m calling, as a matter of fact.\" James's voice was honey on a razor's edge. \"Do you need my badge number and the case file number to put that into motion? No?\" Glancing at Robbie, James rolled his red and watering eyes and gave a slight shake of his head. \"Well, yes, it's been just great talking with you, too. Have a nice day.\" He thumbed off the phone, and leaned on an elbow against the ambulance, thoughtfully tapping the edge of his phone against his lip. \"Fucking nitwit.\" Bet he summoned up that epithet from a textbook, Robbie thought. Sounds unfamiliar enough. \"So, DEA? Could've taken him down in a squad car. Called in the plates on that SUV, in case you were wondering.\" \"For our homophobic friend, the Hulk?\" \"The very one. What were you saying earlier about the plainclothes unit?\" \"Do you see them?\" \"No. Odd, too. Don't see anyone from my division.\" \"Yup. Can't use a squad car.\" James hung his head, rubbing his eyes again. He dropped his hand and sniffled. \"Someone from DEA is coming to take him back into custody.\" James leaned against the ambulance, out of the light of a passing journalist's news camera. \"I don't like all the cameras.\" Robbie couldn't help but grin. \"Might have told me you were Elliot Ness.\" James put his hands in his pockets, sighed, and looked at the ground. \"Different bureau of investigation.\"\"Too tall to be a secret agent?\" He shrugged an apology. \"Look, you deserve an explanation, Robbie, but not here. I need to get this guy into the hands of the proper authorities and then I need a drink.\" \"Not going to another bar,\" Robbie said, shaking his head. \"And we need to get him back into custody.\" James barked a startled laugh as if relieved and let his head fall back against the side of the ambulance with a dull thunk. He stared at the sky and then looked at Robbie. \"We, then.\" His eyes were watery, luminous. \"I want you\u2026\" \"You want me\u2026?\" Robbie let the words trail off. And, he thought, you could have me, too, let's be perfectly clear about that.\"Yeah, I want you.\" They stared at each other, sharing the same air and the acrid smell of tear gas and diesel fumes from the emergency vehicles. Flashing lights illuminated their faces. Robbie inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, just for a moment, to get some focus on the situation and his part in it. He shook his head slightly to clear it. He was undercover, for God's sake, and this was neither the time nor the place for any shenanigans. \"You want me\u2014what? To continue playing your\u2014pickup? Your besotted rough trade? Is that it?\" \"Is that what you want?\" James's eyebrows shot up as his jaw went slack in confusion and then the mask was immediately back in place. \"To keep playing a role?\" It's not a fucking role, man, but until I know exactly what is going on here, I'm not about let it go any further. Of course he couldn't say that, not in so many words. He cocked his head, a tiny shake and dropped his gaze. \"'Besotted rough trade,'\" James murmured. \"No. Not 'rough trade' because I don't find anything about you rough at all. 'Besotted,' though. Fancy word, but it doesn't suit you either.\" That's a relief then\u2014at least he's not revolted. \"I'm English. Fancy words come naturally to our tongues.\" Christ, that sounds pretentious. The other man bit back a grin, and with a glint in his eye, said, \"Do you have a quick tongue then?\" Ah. Was that meant to be a double entendre? Now he's flirting with me. At a crime scene, no less. Robbie raised his eyebrows in answer, watching for a sign in the other man's face. He gave James a tiny nod, just to see what the response would be, shenanigans be damned. Not that he actually had a quick tongue\u2014Morse had always thought him a bit of a plodder. But he knew they weren't talking about language. Not at all. James looked away, and sighed, chewing on his bottom lip to cover the faint smile he wore. \"Most people tend to look away when men kiss in public and won't even remember what the men looked like.\" Robbie was confused for a moment at the seemingly random comment, until he noticed a camera crew and a journalist heading towards them. \"That's your plan to avoid being seen? A public display of affection? For the cameras?\" James appraised him with a wry glance. A dare, is it? Robbie saw the EMT wave the media away from the back of the ambulance. Good\u2014no one would see the bartender being treated. Except\u2014sod it\u2014they were now directly in the path of the news crew. The journalist's voice was perky and bright. \"Let's get the camera over here and pan over those casualties, show off the damage to the building. Then bring it back to me and I'll toss it to the news center.\" The TV news crew's bright light swung to the front of the ambulance, moving slowly, closer and closer to James and Robbie as they leaned against the side of the vehicle. Right. Hide in plain sight, then. It had worked before, only now\u2014now it was a choice. They could easily move away or duck their heads. James pushed away from the truck and suddenly stood in front of Robbie, his body blocking the chaos and cameras. He quickly held up his hand, cradled Robbie's cheek, and leaned in, his breath warm on Robbie's mouth. \"Go on.\" Robbie grinned and saw an answering gleam in James's eyes: a speculative smile widening with delight as if they were at the top of that big roller coaster at Blackpool, hanging in space right before the plunge. Oh, Christ\u2014he really wants to kiss me! Robbie didn't have time to think anything else before James captured his mouth, hard and rough. James exhaled slowly, a soft mewl escaping his lips as he drew back, as though he was surprised by his own action. No more surprised than I am, Robbie thought. He anchored James with one hand behind his neck, while holding onto his waist with the other, slipping his fingers beneath the man's shirt, feeling the hard muscle of his back. Let's see how you do when I up the ante in this game then. James's eyes widened momentarily and then flickered to the slow moving white light as it approached from the side, illuminating the scene, capturing footage for the morning shows in a lengthy sweep. James's back was in the spotlight, from the top of his head to the back of his knees. Brushing his lips against Robbie's ear, he murmured, \"The light isn't moving.\" \"Then we'd better give them something that's not quite suitable for the morning news,\" Robbie whispered, as his hand splayed across James's back beneath his shirt, rucking it up at the corner as his hand moved, slowly exposing the man's back, inch by inch, for the camera. Robbie'd thought about this countless times over the last couple of weeks: how that pale skin would feel against his hand, how he'd palm the faintly defined muscle and how he'd slide his hand up\u2014as he did now\u2014and then down, and down\u2014as he did now. He'd thought about it often enough watching the man's muscles move on stage\u2014completely different feeling them beneath his hand. He kneaded his way down to firmly clamp his hand on James's arse, pulling him closer, locked together from waist to knee, feeling the hard, hot length of the man against him. \"Fuck, Robbie.\" \"Wouldn't say no.\" Damn, had he actually said that out loud? James laughed in response as he nipped Robbie's earlobe, bringing their bodies closer together. They kissed lazily for a moment or two, beginning to learn each other's mouths, until James changed things up again. He ground his hips into Robbie's as he sucked hard on Robbie's bottom lip and, Christ, their groin to groin contact made it abundantly clear that James was just as hard as he was. Robbie was finding it difficult to focus.He completely forgot they were doing this for the cameras, he forgot where they were, forgot everything except the feeling of James, hot against him. His hand slid from James's hip to the zip of his jeans, lingering there. James moved suddenly, pushing him back hard against the metal side of the ambulance, grinding against him, his palms slamming on either side of Robbie's head. \"Shall we give them one last parting shot?\" Robbie felt the words spoken against his neck as he pulled back to see James smirk, an imperceptible shake of his head. Ah, right. Drama for the camera, then. Robbie tried to get himself back under control. They kissed again, mostly for the camera this time, which seemed to linger lovingly on the spectacle. Anonymous gay men snogging each other at a strip club. Something for the breakfast table, Robbie thought, with the morning news and the day's weather. So much for thinking their scorching kiss would be glossed over as unseemly. Brand new day in the USA. About bloody time, too. He smiled against James's mouth, as James smiled against his own. Their moment of fame ended as the light moved to the reporter. \"And, as you've just witnessed, couples have been reunited, unharmed, from the smoke-filled chaos. Back to you in the studio.\" As the darkness enveloped them, James dropped his forehead to Robbie's shoulder. \"I'd like to try that again.\" Robbie's heart lurched in his chest. He smiled back at James as he said, \"Was that a rehearsal, then?\" James's hands cupped Robbie's shoulders and his eyes were heavy-lidded as he brushed his lips back and forth over Robbie's lips. \"Are you saying my performance needs work?\"  He smirked as he stepped back. \"Maybe you could help me with my technique later, then.\"It had been years since Robbie had participated in such suggestive flirting, and he was definitely enjoying it. He wanted to offer an appropriately witty response, but his heart was still pounding so loudly he really couldn't think, let alone come up with anything saucy. So he just grinned and nodded. He wasn't entirely sure what had just happened, or what was yet to come, but he knew that he very much wanted to find out. At the moment, however, they both had responsibilities. He jerked his head toward the back of the ambulance.\"Shall we see how our miscreant is doing?\" He looked into James's eyes and his own hurt in empathy as he saw how red and inflamed James's eyes were. \"James, your eyes\u2014\" \"I know. Later.\" James went to the back of the ambulance to wait for the bartender to be released. Robbie's heart clenched\u2014too much adrenalin\u2014he felt like he could barely breathe. He followed James, watching the other man's shoulder brushing against the side of the vehicle, and wondered why he felt it so keenly, this bond with a man he didn't even know and who was surprising him at every turn. The bartender had gauze pads over his eyes, a few strips of gauze wrapped around his head. \"Justice is blind,\" he quipped as Robbie took his elbow. You better hope so, Robbie thought. \"We're getting you out of here,\" James said. \"DEA will be here any minute.\" \"But I made a deal. You gotta take me into the station. They're expecting me.\" Now that's interesting. Robbie looked to James, who stared into the distance, tears streaming from his eyes. He wiped his cheek. Robbie and James guided the bartender to the far end of the parking lot, walking on either side of him, out of the white lights of the media and beyond the flashing red, blue, and yellow lights of highway patrol cars and Fire-Rescue Units. Robbie stopped and hung back, just a few yards away. He looked around, feeling as if someone was watching, but everyone seemed to be wrapped up in their own response to the conclusion of the drama. Cell phone cameras captured the images, people were narrating over their videos to be uploaded to YouTube and Snapchat. He wondered if the dancers were avoiding the cameras because they didn't want their friends to know what they did on Wednesday nights. The bar didn't look much the worse for it, though. Robbie guessed it would be mostly smoke damage inside: he'd heard a firefighter say that colored smoke bombs\u2014the kind kids brought across the border to set off on the Fourth of July\u2014were set off with a couple of tear gas canisters. Heavy ash content. Easy to do, meant to scare people. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt. Someone had removed the strip club door and set it aside next to a large piece of plywood. The news crew stood right in front to sensationalize the event for the morning news, pointing out what Robbie was sure would be called: \"Hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.\" He wondered if anyone had turned off the water inside. A good mop of the floor could only improve the place. He hung back at the edge of the parking lot, looking for the plainclothes unit, noticing again that there were no cars from his division. Odd. An unmarked black Ford pulled into the parking lot where James and the bartender were waiting. Robbie had an uneasy moment: if this was a movie, this is where they'd shoot the bartender and James before the car sped away. Christ, he needed to stop watching TV. Or worse yet, it would be that moment when James would get in and disappear with the bartender, badge and all, never to be seen again. He watched as James quickly pushed the guy into the back seat and then stood there, talking with the man in the suit standing beside the car, trying to avoid attracting attention. He put his hands on his hips and turned toward Robbie. An invitation? Robbie bit his lower lip as he hurried over. James hadn't made a gesture, hadn't so much as raised an eyebrow, and yet as he turned, Robbie knew it meant, 'Get over here.' \"Gentlemen,\" said James. \"Robbie Lewis, Ocean Beach PD. He needs to see badges and paperwork. And he has the plates for the other suspect. Black Lexus, SUV.\" \"Notified local law enforcement,\" Robbie interjected. No way was that bartender disappearing under his watch. The agents rolled their eyes, but complied easily. DEA officers. They showed him a smart tablet, took his information and put out an APB for the vehicle. They sent him an email receipt for the suspect\u2014having him sign the touchscreen with the tip of his finger. \"Not taking a chance of losing someone in the inter-agency system again,\" quipped one of them as he re-cuffed the suspect. \"Comes out of our paychecks now.\" \"Oh, I'm sure that hasn't happened in months,\" said James, dryly. He ducked his head into the backseat to address the bartender, \"See you in court.\" \"Over my dead body.\" James smiled tightly and slammed the car door hard, startling a protest from everyone in the vehicle. \"He's a real charmer.\" Robbie was glad to be rid of the man. \"You know he cut a deal? One in a hundred people in the US are incarcerated\u2014\" \"\u2014And he's going to walk away.\" \"Sounds like you need that drink, James.\" \"Yup.\" The bright lights from the media dimmed and went out, and the crowd slowly dispersed. Officers were looping crime scene tape around the bar and securing the scene. They stood in the parking lot, watching as the car disappeared. Robbie shoved his hands in his pockets, jingling his keys. James stood at his shoulder. \"Badges and forms okay?\" James asked quietly, staring in the direction of the retreating car. \"'Course\u2014checked for the hologram and chip on the badges. Just felt my phone vibrate with the email receipt. Why?\" James let out a pained sigh. \"Because my eyes hurt like hell and I can't see a fucking thing.\"\n"}}, "1605449": {"Chapters:": "42/?", "Words:": "47974", "Characters:": ["Robert Lewis", "Laura Hobson", "Hooper (Lewis)", "James Hathaway", "Jean Innocent", "Valerie Lewis", "Siobhan Maitland (Morse)", "Endeavour Morse"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Vita Nuova", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Bookmarks:": "10", "Published:": "2014-05-12", "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Categories:": ["F/M", "M/M"], "Kudos:": "111", "Summary": "\n\n\"Midway along the journey of our life I woke to\nfind myself in a dark wood,  for I had\nwandered off from the straight path.\"\nDante.

A woman pauses at a window, pale and solemn, her hand resting on the second life swelling at her waist. Two friends embrace each other on a doorstep, and exchange the kiss of peace. A boy holds his hand under cool running water, sluicing away a fine thread of red from a fresh cut. A doorkeeper washes away the traces of the day's labour with lazy damp flicks of a mop...\nRobert Lewis passes among these citizens unseen, unheard, his tongue stuck fast within his skull.\nHe has crossed the city a thousand times in his restless dreams, yet has never reached its limits. He has searched its docks, seen warehouses piled with the trade of a thousand lands, glimpsed the masts of a thousand ships crowding over its rooftops, yet has never found the wharves, or seen the waves he can hear washing their stony sides. He has climbed endless staircases among the towers and domes and spires - but has never reached their summit.\nAnd although the stones around him are warm, and sunlight spills across them like slow honey, he knows that if he looks upward he will see only blackness, and stars that crackle like frost, never thawing, or moving or fading to herald dawn.\nAnd he also knows, that, among all these these indifferent strangers and empty sepulchres, the one person he seeks breathes, lives, laughs, somewhere, separate from him, unseen, unheard, but perhaps only a few heartbeats away, on the far side of the next wall, passing in the street below, or on the creaking floorboards overhead. Always faceless, unfound, unknown, but there, waiting, in potential. He can hear their name in the breeze, in the conversations of the market place, and know that he once knew it well...\n...yet, every time he sense that he is close, that the next turn in his path will bring their separated paths back together, he fails, and falls, into the crumpled cotton darkness of his waking life, the alarm on his phone calling him back, hard, aching, alone...\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\n\nThe phone throbs against the water glass beside the bed, calling \u201cSer, ser, ser\u2026\u201d.

And I'm not on duty, just here as the Chauffeur\u201d, Robbie juggles coffee, still hot enough to burn through skin like sulphuric acid, and nods toward the halo of bright lights which envelops Laura, her colleagues and the poor sod whose path has petered out in this scrubby patch of land beside the A40.\u201cWoooah - She got you under the cosh, pretty smartish. Thought you might be here to hold the hand of the Boy Wonder. This being his first solo shout, and all.\u201dRobbie turns, and despite himself, the coffee spills and scalds his wrist. Now he knows exactly whose toes he has stamped on by driving here.Hathaway is just a silhouette, standing apart from the little knot of police, forensics, and bystanders, leaning against the bonnet of his car, arms folded, the glow of his cigarette competing against the orange sodium of the Industrial Estate, and a flickering marquee offering 24 hour Bowling and Pool.Robbie doesn\u2019t need to see more then this to read the tension in Hathaway\u2019s stillness, as he waits to be beckoned towards his first corpse. He remembers his own - not the case, but the queasy mix of terror, and exhilaration, half-fearful that Morse would appear at his shoulder and tell him the whole thing - his promotion, his new title, the call out - was just an extended practical joke, half desperately hopeful that he would.\u201cThat\u2019s Inspector Hathaway, to you, Constable.\u201dHooper draws himself back. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201dRobbie wishes now he\u2019d given Laura his keys and resigned himself to a long night watching the endless loop of the news channel, until the sky lightened and he had an alibi for his wakefulness.\u201cDo us a favour, Hoop - don\u2019t let on I\u2019m here.\u201dHooper grins. \u201cRight you are, sir.\u201dHe retreats back to the car, sucking on his wrist, blowing on the coffee, and hoping Hathaway, normally so observant, has not somehow sensed his presence here. His \u201cboy wonder\u201d? Was that tiny figure beside him his new bagman, Frankie? Nat? Something laddish. He wishes he\u2019d met her properly, talked to her, warned her, hoped she was tougher than she looked, hoped that nerves wouldn\u2019t make Hathaway mean-mouthed. His height alone must intimate her - hell, it intimidated him, still, from time to time.From the car, Robbie considers the strangeness of this little patch of land beside the thundering trucks of dual carriageway; used to be a children\u2019s playground, years back. He brought the kids here, with their bikes, acres of safe, sunlit. cracked concrete, a kiosk selling ice cream and pop. He remembers shouting encouragement to Mark, wobbling a little, that first afternoon without stabilisers, but so proud, independent at last.Fifty feet away, Hathaway\u2019s cigarette skitters across the concrete, shedding a last shower of light.Robbie sinks further in his seat, swelling with pride and loss, as Hathaway unfolds himself and lopes towards the summoning lightThe swings have long gone, replaced by \u201cTop-Tots-Fun-Town\u201d, \"Drive-Thru Dixieland Fried Chicken\", \"Sofaworld\", \"Carpet-City\", \"Beddy-Buyzzzz\", and a 14 Screen Multiplex and Bowling Alley; 24 hour food, fun, shopping, and sex (he knows for a fact that there is at least one brothel operating from the anonymous blocks of the industrial estate, that the car park is still a gay pickup zone) - all the appearance of human life, but none of its meat; no homes, no gardens, no schools - just an expansive fringe of tarmac marked out in rectangles for a few hours free parking and anonymous hand job.What had Morse called those things - those painted villages the Russians once built, all canvas and plywood and false lights, to make travellers think the wilderness bloomed with prosperity; Potckins? Potemkins? No, that couldn\u2019t be right - that was some kind of ship wasn\u2019t it? He wondered if \"Battleship Potemka\" was still offering her very specialised cruise service out there, right now, \"Happy Ending guaranteed\".A fake city, flashing its lights in the darkness to convince the passing world that all was well, Happy Ending guaranteed.Christ, here he is, on the edge of a new life; two weeks of sunshine, good food, good wine, decent music, a beautiful smart woman who inexplicably had no objections to waking beside him every morning, kids grown up, happy, well, Hathaway taking his first case \u2026 so why should he feel so lost?Hathaway.He\u2019s out of the car before the impulse that drives him surfaces in his conscious thoughts. Something wrong. Something terribly out of place.He sprints across the tarmac, sees heads turns, towards him, towards the circle of light. Laura - framed in white tyvek, face pale, eyes dark with concern. James - a clot of shadow, hunched over, on his knees, breathing hard. Retching. Vomiting.Robbie is first to reach him, first to place a hand on his heaving shoulder. James\u2019s gaze snaps up from the newly stained cement, as if his mentor\u2019s appearance here is the least unsurprising event of the night, his eyes huge and dark in the stark electric light, and says -\u201cFuck. Fuck. Not again. Fuck. God. Not again.\u201d\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am - no need to come out.  I\u2019ve taken over here.

Laura is kneeling at its side, teasing at a scrap of paper clutched in one outstretched hand. She looks up - \"Robbie? What's happening - Is James OK?

In the process they have stripped away their own.\"No.\" James folds forward, all the tension in his shoulders is released.\"Thank god.\" His hand flies to his mouth, as if forestall another evulsion of bile.\"He was struck on the back of the head. And someone moved him here after death.You thought he might be suicidal?\"\"He was upset, angry, ashamed...\" passes a hand over his long face. \u201cHe was waiting for me, on the doorstep when I got home last night,with a bottle of wine. Said he needed to talk...\"\"You weren't expecting him?\"James shakes his head. \"Hadn't seen him for years. I bumped into him with his wife in the Covered Market a few weeks ago, distributing cards for his new studio. Here - \" He fishes through his wallet, and hands over a square of brightly crumbled board, one of those cheap business cards you get over the internet. Photography - Babies, Schools, Weddings Our Speciality. \"He'd been a keen amateur . We said the usual things, swapped numbers, promised to stay in touch, have dinner, celebrate - his marriage, new business, my promotion. Then nothing - until tonight.\"\"Let's start at the beginning. How long have you known Dunn?\"\"10 years. Easter 2004. When I left the seminary I had \u00a350, a guitar and a scribbled address for a house in Oxford - a sort-of drop-in centre for Catholic in Crisis. Micky was there ahead of me, looked after me. We shared a flat for a few months.\"\"Good friend?\"\"I admired him - I'm just a drop-out. Mickey was the real deal - a Priest who had abandoned everything - career, income, pension, home, friends - to uphold a point of doctrine. It made him seem a little - heroic.\"\"What was this 'point of doctrine'?\"\"Micky objected to women priests and married clergy\"\"But I thought? - Hang on - you lot - you don't have any women? Or married Priests -\"Actually, 'our lot' do. Not women - but ex-Anglican Priests.\"\"So - no, let's leave that rabbit hole for later. You and Dunn were close.\"\"Not close - but friendly. I went a bit wild for the first months out of the seminary...\"\"I dread to think - ,\" If his own observation is anything to go by, James's definition of 'wild' probably includes staying out past midnight, drinking imported larger, and kissing on a first date.\"It was good not to go back to an empty room, to have some one older around, someone who understood what I'd done. I needed that. He liked being needed. I trusted him. Then I joined the police, moved on, we lost touch...\"\"Until last night? What did he need to talk about that upset him so much? \"\u201cThe past - his, mine. Sins of Commission. Sins of Omission.\" James leans his head against the cool glass, staring out at the perpetual glow cast on the clouds by the lights of Oxford. His silence is immense, familiar, and unbreakable. Robbie waits. \"All I know is that the last time I tried to do this, I fucked up so badly I almost got us both killed. So. This time, we do it properly. I'll tell you everything I can.\"First, someone needs to tell his wife. Her name\u2019s Debbie. Just - someone gentle. She\u2019s eight months pregnant.\"\"Christ. I'll go.\"\"No\" James, pulls sharply at the loose elastoplast, and winces. A slow trickle of blood oozes from beneath. \"Stay with me. That's the only way I can do this.\"\"Ok\" James raises his head and meets his eyes for the first time.\"I'll stay.\"\"I want to make a formal statement.\"\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\n\nSTATEMENT OF WITNESS\n\n(C J Act 1967 s.4\u00a0; M C Act 1980, ss. 53(3)(a) and 55; MC Rules 1981, r. 20)\n\nStatement of: James HATHAWAYAge of Witness (Date of Birth): Over 18Occupation of Witness: Police OfficerAddress: 57A Virgil Road OXFORD OX2 9BQ\n\nThis statement, consisting of ....5 pages signed by me, is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to he false or do not believe to be true.\n\nDated: 18 April 2014Signed: J C HathawaySignature Witnessed by: DC A HOOPER\n\n{TVP/1/0059}\nLast night - Michael Dunn attempted to blackmail me. He just wasn't very good at it.\n\n\nHe had arrived with a bottle of wine - unopened - to celebrate my promotion, he said - but I was certain he had already been drinking. That was out of character - he didn't like alcohol, rarely touched it. He wasn't exactly drunk, but pretty unsteady, emotional.\n\nAt first I put it down to nervousness about his impending fatherhood - I knew his wife must be pretty much near her due date. But he kept on asking me about my life, the flat, my work - How rewarding it must be, I - the security, authority, respect... Was I troubled by the things I saw and heard, he knew secrets were , the darkness I uncovered, the perversity? Secrets could be a terrible burden - he knew all about that.\n\nAll the time he kept drinking. Dutch courage, it turns out.\n\nWhen I lost patience, and asked him outright what he wanted; One thousand pounds. In return I'd get negatives of photographs he had taken, back when we shared rooms, and the comfort of knowing one secret would be safe from my colleagues. So I'd never have to know what it was like to have every I valued stripped away.\nI called his bluff.I told him to go ahead - send the pictures to anyone who cared to see them - I even offered names, email addresses. I told him his information was worthless, because I had no secrets at work - that my superiors knew what he knew. That I had sex with men.I lied.\u00a0\n", "7": "\nChapter Text\nJames Hathaway closes his eyes, and delivers up his clothing, piece by piece into ministering, gloved hands.  Watch. Phone.  Lighter.

He kept insisting he was good man, he'd never broken a vow, always acted on conscience, resisted temptation, kept faith - and the world reviled him, spat filthy names at him, took his work, his pride. All around him he saw hypocrites, pharisees and sinners thrive, while he lost everything. Pathetic. He disgusted me.I offered him the money anyway, as a gift. It seemed to be the last straw. He hit me, we struggled, he left. \u00a0I was worried. He was inebriated, unstable, in no fit state to get home, so I followed. \u00a0I was afraid he might do himself harm. \u00a0It was almost 10.30. \u00a0I don't know if anyone saw him leave. \u00a0My neighbour, Mrs Staskiewicz may have heard us fighting - \u00a0she thumped on the floor above. \u00a0I drove around for a while, to see if I could find him, but didn't see him, or the cycle.

That Robbie's own daughter seemed worldlier at twelve does nothing to improve his growing distaste for the recent life choices of the late Mickey Dunn, now lying, shrouded, on the far side of the glass before them.Dunn is the natural centre of attention, but it's Debbie he's watching when the attendant peels back the sheet. That's how he's the first to see the waxen stillness in her cheeks the dip of her head, and why he is first to catches her and ease her gently to the floor.Outside, in the warm spring sunlight, the girl sips water from a plastic cup and remembers how to breathe.\"Is there anyone we can call, Debbie? Your mum, or a friend?\" he asks. She just shakes her head, rocking, folding her grief tight within. \"There must be someone we can call?\u201d\"I had Mickey. He was all I needed. I told him, over and over, I told him to wear his helmet. The roads round our place are so dangerous.\"\"Debbie - we don't think it was a car that hit him.\u201d\"What then?\u201d\"We'll find out, I promise. Did he tell you where he was going last night?\"\"Confession.\"\"Like in a church? Do you know which one?\u201dShe shakes her head. \"He moved around, since - It's just easier that way.\"\"And you weren't worried when he didn't come back?\"\"Maundy Thursday - I \u2013 I thought he'd stayed to keep vigil.\u201dIt's there, Robbie sees it: the hesitation, the glance sideways, a wife's fears surfacing, only to be reburied before they can undermine the faith she needs to carry on.\"Mickey\u2019s a good man. God rewards the faithful, he always says \u2013 and he does. He really does. Look how Mickey's uncle gave us enough to rent the studio, just when we needed it. And Mickey was so excited about the baby - all he ever wanted was to have a family. Now - oh, God... what will I do now!\"Her mouth opens in a zero of loss, the vastness of her despair breaking out of her in an animal howl, buried in Robbie\u2019s shoulder. He held his own children like this in the days of grief, feeling their ribs heave under his hands, unable to take away their pain.At last she pulls away, wiping her face with her sleeve. \"Sorry.\"\"Here, lass.\" He passes over the handkerchief kept in his inner pocket for just such moments. Part of the tool kit. \"You cry as just much as you need to.\"\"You have a family, don't you,\u201d she says.\"Two kids - and a grandson.\"\"I can tell. My dad won't talk to me - not since the wedding.\"\"I'll bet he'd want to hug you if he could see you now, pet.\" She doesn't reply, but a last sob shudders through her.\"I know what you're thinking. About me and Mickey. Every one thinks the same thing. But I chose him. And he never touched me, not the way people think. Not till the day we were married. He'd kept himself pure for that. He gave up everything, for me.\" She twists and folds the handkerchief, over and over. \"Mr Lewis - your wife, are you still close?\"\"Ah, well - my wife died - \"\"Oh...\"\"But she feels close, to me at least. Like she's in the next room.\"\"When you had children, though \u2013 when..\u201dHer knuckles are white as the damp twisting cotton, \u201cdid thing\u2019s change then. Between you - \"\"Did Mickey change? When you got pregnant?\"\"Only after \u2013 when I got bigger. Fatter. He couldn't touch me any more. Wouldn\u2019t look at me. Not all swollen up like this.\"\"Oh, lass...\" he says.\"It was wrong. I was all wrong.\"\"No. Not you.\" As he rubs her shaking shoulders, Robbie thinks of the condoms, a pack of three from a pub vending machine, one missing. If Dunn wasn't having sex with his pregnant wife, perhaps he was looking elsewhere. He thinks of Dunn lying a few feet away, naked, secrets laid bare under Laura's knife. \"Not you. Nothing wrong with you at all.\u201d He thinks of Debbie lying alone in the darkness, last night in hope, tonight in the certainty of loss. \u201cIt\u2019s just, well - becoming a dad, it's a scary thing. Not as scary as being a mum must seem - but you realise, you're the one responsible. You made this thing happen, and there's no going back. Sometimes - something in your head gets in the way for a while. Doesn\u2019t mean there's anything wrong with you - or that your husband didn\u2019t love you.\" He squeezes her hand and a half smile appears, lopsided, on her face.\"Sir.\" De Souza interrupts from the doorway. \"Family liaison's arrived.\"Robbie disentangles himself from Debbie and helps her to her feet. \"You should go home now, rest as much as you can. We'll need to ask you some questions - not right away, when you're ready. DC De Souza will stay with you, just to get you settled, make sure you've got everything you need.\" He can see the startled look in De Souza's eyes as she follows them to the car.Debbie turns back once, the damp handkerchief in her outstretched hand. \"Keep it, lass,\" he says. \"You can give it back next time.\"She grips his hand, and says, \"Mickey was fine until he got mixed up with that friend of his.\"\"This friend have a name?\u201d\"Jamie. Someone he knew from way back, when he first came to Oxford. .

Do you know him?\"\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cFind him. Find out how Mickey died, for the baby. Promise.\"\"I do my best, Debbie.\" He closes the car door. Debbie shrinks back into her lonely silence on the far side.De Souza is at his elbow again. \u201cSir?\u201d\"What did you find out on Dunn?\"\"Not much \u2013 he was a part-time teacher at the Tech, resigned after rumours about him and one of the pupils there. Her family made a complaint, but there are no charges on file. Uniform got called out to the address a couple of times last year, windows put in, some graffiti. \".\"Stay close to her \u2013 and be kind. She needs a friend.\"\"Sir - \" She's winding herself up to confront him. \"Family Liaison are the babysitters. There's real work I should be doing.\u201d\"Which is exactly what you will would be doing spending time with Debbie Dunn. Frankie - I'm not sending you to hold her hand because you're a woman, I'm sending you because I was told you were a bloody good detective, and I need to know what Dunn was up to and who might have had a reason to take a crow bar to his skull. Find out about the uncle who gave them money at Christmas, and what the hell was in in those photographs.\"\u00a0\n", "10": "\nChapter Text\nAlone for the first time since he'd flung his coffee aside in the Fry's Hill car park, Robbie lingers for a moment in the unexpected morning sunshine. It's at moments like this that he envies the smokers the ready-made punctuation to their day, 20 packaged and timed opportunities to stand apart and think.\nThere's a chill in the air, just enough to remind the paramedics moving to and fro in the loading zone how high North Oxford sits above the Thames, how cold its springs can be.\nLess than a mile from here, and more than thirty years ago, a ludicrously young copper and his far wiser wife had huddled together through winter and spring in their first home, clinging to each other under the sheets, astonished by the transformations worked in her the child they had made, her body unfurling, darkening, opening, swelling.\nHe could not speak the words to tell her of his love so he showed her, with his fingers, mouth, arms, breath, thighs, marvelling at the new heat in her skin, within and without, scalding as he entered her. \nOne morning, stationed right here, in the old Hospital beat office, he had suddenly recalled the intoxicating scent of her hair, at the junction of neck, arm, and thigh, and been overcome with desire and fear. He had the mile home, still in uniform, red faced, and sweating to embrace her, in an ecstasy of fumbling and laughter and shed buttons.\nLater as three of them lay in the same bed and he watched Val direct a fat brown digit of nipple into the perfect pink O of their daughter's mouth he knew, with a stab of glorious pain that he could never love or desire her more than he did at that moment. And swore he would never love her less.\nHe doesn't weep. That spring ran dry a long time ago. Besides, he has no handkerchief.\n", "11": "\nChapter Text\nBy the time he feels ready to return to the mortuary Laura is done, and hosing down the empty slab. \"You missed the show,\" she says; she has already unpacked Dunn like a magician's cabinet, weighed and recorded his secrets and secretions, reassembled his component parts and put him quietly away backstage.He once asked, not long after they first met, how she coped with days spent elbow deep in the dead. \"Corpses don't hurt people\", she'd replied, hands fully engaged with the sodden abdomen of a suicide fished out of the Isis. \"It's the living you have to watch out for, I'm told. And that's why we employ nice boys like you and Morse.\" \"I thought I might have been stood up,\" she says now, stripping off her gloves. \"Hathaway still goofing off, then?\"He drops a kiss on her proffered cheek. He knows that Laura is covering her concern. She's always been strikingly protective of James, but he has no inclination to share the details of his statement with her, not here. Instead he sorts through the litter of evidence bags crated up on the counter. \" \u2019fraid so - he's left me to work out exactly what Mr Dunn was up to last night. This all the forensics from the scene?\" Loose change, condom pack, receipts, the scrap of crumpled paper found clutched in Dunn's hand - definitely the corner of a photograph, glossy black and white. He squints through the polythene, but can make nothing of it, and drops it back for future study. \"So, tell me - when, where, how, and who?\"Laura pitches the balled up gloves into the waste with dead-eye accuracy. \"The 'when' you know. Between 10 and midnight.\"\"You can't be more precise?\"She sighs. \"How many times do we have to have this conversation before you understand my limitations? That's as precise an answer as you are going to get.\" The apron follows the gloves into the bin. \"But I might be able to help you with the where, at least until the lab rats come back with something more conclusive from the clothing. I found traces of a pink fluid driven into the wound by the force of the blow. Liquid soap. Like this...\"She pulls a generous slug from the dispenser and starts to wash her hands. \"So - a washroom?\"\"Well yes - but in conjunction with the shower curtain, I'd say a bathroom was more likely, wouldn't you?\" She dries her hands and reaches for hand cream. For all her insouciance in the face of death and decay, Robbie knows Laura's hands are scrubbed red raw in the aftermath of murder. \"As to how - flip a coin. The broken skull killed him, but Mr Dunn's last supper didn't help. Stomach contents: chickpeas, garlic, wholemeal bread, white wine, lots and lots of wine, black coffee - and a whacking great dose of Zolpidem.\"\"Zolpidem? You mean the date-rape drug?\" \"I mean the entirely respectable prescription sedative which, yes, unfortunately is sometimes used by the sort of creep who likes their victim helpless and suggestible. And before you ask, it has been used in the past to drug and assault men. By rapists of both genders.\"\"Was there any sign of -\" he blushes, tongue-tied. Thirty five years a copper - three of those in Vice - and he still stumbles, \"you know, 'funny stuff'?\" \"Sex, Robbie. You can say the word in front of me. I'm a grown up, I won't scream or call for the headmistress. But no, there's no sign of 'funny stuff', consensual or otherwise. Just enough hypnotic and alcohol in his bloodstream to have induced fatal respiratory arrest if the blow hadn\u2019t finished him first.\"\"It could have been an overdose.\"\"Ah, I thought of that! Here - I filtered the stomach contents.\"Robbie steels himself, but sees only a tiny pinch of dark brown grains in the glass dish. \"What exactly am I looking at?\"\"Di-calcium phosphate. It's a bulk filler, designed to slow down passage of drugs through the stomach. And this is what you find when someone's food or drink has been spiked with a handful of tablets and they don't live long enough to tell the tale.\"Robbie thinks back to the crumbled cardboard box in its polythene nest. \"Dunn was carrying condoms. Which suggests someone looking for - you know -\u201d\"Sex.\"\"Sex, and with someone other than his pregnant wife. But, in that case, why would someone need to drug him?\"\"Maybe he wasn't up for whatever it was the creep wanted. Wrong gender, wrong type? Or maybe he - or she - gets off on the sense of control, having a sex-puppet to play with. It might be consensual - the offer of a little something extra for relaxation. Am I helping? I'm trying to do the detective-y bit here, seeing as you've lost your usual partner-in-crime.\"\"Pretty good - have you ever thought about a career in Police Work?\"\"And try to live on the pittance you lot get paid? Not on your life! Now stop cluttering up my mortuary, and get on with finding your answers. And don't forget to give my regards to the lanky one.\"\n", "12": "\nChapter Text\nIt's disconcerting to face Jean Innocent alone. As she waves him to the right hand chair Robbie realises he always takes that side, James takes the left, and now he is shipwrecked there.At least Innocent looks as awkward as he feels. She's still dressed for the weekend his telephone call brought to an abrupt end eight hours ago, sandals and jeans rather than suit and earrings, \"South Coast Surfari 2011\" scrawled in sun-faded lettering across her chest. Mr Innocent, he recalls, is a keen, if accident-prone, surfer.Something of her holiday informality lingers... She perches on the desk, and leans in.to say, \"Thank you for handling this so well - I know it's never easy when loyalties are divided.\u201d\"My loyalties are where they have always been, Ma'am.\"She straightens her voice still conciliatory. \u201cThank God you were on hand to take control so promptly this morning.\" The phone on the polished surface beside her throbs with incoming messages. Robbie can see her fingers twitch with the effort of ignoring each skittering movement, each strident bleat for attention. \"Bring me up to speed.\"He knows that she has read the notes he handed to Janice an hour ago. A PA's overtime rate is twice his, and Janice's presence on a Bank Holiday morning has set an alert trilling deep in his gut. He doesn't want today to be exceptional. He doesn't want to see evidence of the alarm the events of the morning have triggered. He needs this to be an ordinary day, a simple case, an executive summary of CCTV footage pulled, neighbours canvassed, suspects compiled, and arrests made.But he has to admit that he has halfway into to the Gold Twenty Four Hours of the investigation, and he has no arrests, no suspects, not even a primary crime scene. Just a DI three floor below wearing a track in the carpeting of the interview suite.\"Tell me about the blackmail angle?\" she asks, \"Can we turn up other victims, someone with more to lose and less self-control?\"\"Hathaway says he didn't know Dunn well enough to know who else might have been his targets. We need the photographs - uniform are securing the lock-up Dunn rented as a studio, SOCO will check it over as soon as they finished with Hathaway's flat.\" Robbie thinks of the pale child weeping into his shoulder in the hospital car park, and knows he could have pushed her harder. \"And I've put De Souza in the house with the widow, told her to keep her eyes and ears open.\"\"What about the sex angle? The victim was found close to a known cruising zone; we've been fielding complaints from the Fry's Hill developers for months now. Looking for sex - or men to blackmail?\"\"I'll put some mobile units out there tonight, with head-shots, see if Dunn's been spotted there before.\"\"I'll brief the LGBT team first - we need absolutely transparency, and full public confidence. No, I can't fault the choices you've made.\" She picks up James's statement, \"Nor Hathaway's. Absolute transparency - that's the only way to proceed.\" She taps the page. \"Smart of you, getting Hooper to witness this, avoids any hint of collusion.\" She lets the paper drop to the desk. \"Pity Hathaway didn't speak up last month, when we were recruiting for the Diversity and Community Committee.\"Robbie can't think of anything more likely to have driven James to add another lock to his closet door. \"Not really his cup of tea, is it Ma'am? Committees and acronyms and that.\"\n  \"If you say so. You'd probably know more about his drinking habits than anyone.\" She fixes him with an unblinking eye. \"I am assuming you also knew he was gay?\"\n\n He meets her gaze steadily, \"DI Hathaway has never lied to me about that aspect of his life.\u201d\n\n If she recognises the evasion, she lets it slide past her with no more than a raised eyebrow. \"And you don't have a problem with it - ?\"\n\n \"Of course not. Ma'am.\"\n\n  \"Good for you!  And now of course, we're ludicrously shorthanded - haven't even replaced Petersen, just don't have the funding. Jeffries is on a team building exercise in the Brecon Beacons and not answering his phone. Chaudry's on sick leave again - hernia; Hathaway was my cover for the entire weekend, until you came back on Tuesday...\"\n\"I'm back now.\"\"Which is wonderful,\" she says, \"but you have to back right off this case. You are too close.\"\"Ma'am...?\"\"I called in a favour - Greater Manchester are lending us Detective Superintendent Maitland... She should be here by,\" she checks her watch, \"three at the latest.\"The name stops Robbie dead. \"Siobhan Maitland?\"\"You know her?\"\"Aye, she was on secondment with us, back in the 90s. On a serial sex case. I thought, well - violence against women was her thing back then.\"\"Vulnerable Victims and Hate Crimes. I've heard her speak, she's impressive.\"\"She's sharp, I'll say that.\" - And she's willing to cut corners to get a result, he wants to add.\"Maitland has asked that we stand down now, lock down all the physical evidence and scenes until she's had a chance to review them for herself.\"\"And witnesses?\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Does she expect me to keep DI Hathaway locked down for her as well?\"\"Don't be ridiculous! Look, Robbie, James did the right thing, he trusts the process, he\u2019s put everything out into the open, into our hands\u2026\"\"Into my hands, Ma'am.\"\"And now I trust you to hand it over. Oh, for God's sake Robbie, do you have any idea how high the stakes are right now?\" she snatches up the buzzing phone \"We're trending on bloody twitter right now - #hatecrime #homophobia #queer-bashing! Your blackmailer got knocked on the head at the wrong time and in exactly the wrong place!\"\"I know precisely what the stakes are, Ma\u2019am. A man is dead. His wife is in pieces. His bairn will grow up without a dad. And right now one of your best officers - a man who considers you a friend - is sitting in the basement in paper overalls instead of doing his job and finding the killer.\" The phone in Innocent's hand buzzes again. \"You should just switch that bloody thing off, and start talking to people, instead of fretting over \"Trends: and \"Twits\" and \"Hash-tags\" or whatever they are.\"\"Enough!\" He hears the steel in her voice, the warning to back down. Jean Innocent didn't climb the stairs to this office by charm alone. There was blood on the handrail every step of the way. Her predecessor, Strange, never scared him. Innocent does.\u201c- Ma'am.\"\"Oh, dammit. It's James I'm looking out for here. We can't afford the slightest shadow of doubt in the chain of evidence and risk some smart-alec barrister muddying his evidence and his reputation. This has to be squeaky clean.\" Her head snaps up, as does her voice. \u201dJanice! I said no interruptions!\"\"Sorry,\" Janice, undaunted, says from the doorway \"but you need to take this call. I've got the Mail on the line.\"\"For pity's sake; tell Ben I'll call him back after lunch.\"\"Not the Oxford Mail. The Daily Mail. Crime Features. They are running a piece about an upswing in hate crime in the wake of same sex-marriage.\"\"Oh, buggering hell.\" The colour has faded from her cheeks. \"Stall them. Five minutes.\" The door swings shut. She turns back. \"Robbie, do the right thing. Take Hathaway home. Look after him. And let Maitland do her job and find the killer for us.\"\n", "13": "\nChapter Text\nThe laughter gusting through the interview suite rattles to a close as Robbie pushes open the swing door. Banter, Hooper would call it, the mutual needling which has been part of this job since the days of fog, hansom cabs and helmets. But there is an edge to sound this afternoon, an undercurrent of unease and constraint in the ragged silence. At its centre James smiles mildly, as he always does, but the smile is plastered as tightly to his face as his knuckles are clenched behind his back. Today he has freely handed his amiable tormentors the power to wound, and they know it, the potential for harm crackling in the confined space.He catches Robbie's eye, and shrugs, \"The things I have to do to bunk off for the weekend!\", he says, and tugs at the hem of the rugby shirt that manages to be simultaneous far too wide and 4 inches too short.It\u2019s an improvement on the scene suit, but not by much. It looks as if he has been kitted out from the lockers of the half dozen colleagues who can match his height; boat-sized trainers from which his ankles rise like naked oarsmen, sweatpants already sagging from his bony hips, leaving an undefended tender, pale flesh.\"Well, it seems to be working,\" he replies \"we're out of here. Innocent's orders.\u201dIt's a long walk down to the car, past open doorways, and open curiosity. James doesn't even pause to push the passenger seat, still adjusted for Laura as it was for the drive to Heathrow ten days ago. He simply folds his limbs around his body, like a spider protecting its belly as it falls. Robbie bites his lip, and turns the key. \"Let\u2019s get you home.\" \"I'm pretty sure SOCO is still busily taking my home apart. Something else for Mrs Staskiewicz to complain about.\"\"I meant my place.\" \"No.\"\"Don't be daft - I'm on call, but you can shower, catch a few hours\u2019 kip on the sofa, there's grub in the freezer, beer in the fridge... \u201d\"I said. No.\" \"Ok. So where - ?\"\"157 Isis Way. Off the Abingdon Road.\u201dThe drive is longer than it should be. The first Bank Holiday of the year has drawn the day-trippers, a brightly chaotic mass, spilling over kerbs, eyes anywhere but the road, necks craned upward to spires and downward to phone screens. The English are always easiest to spot among the crowds. First hint of sun and they strip to shorts and sandals and spaghetti straps and acres of winter-white flesh. As the car inches towards Folly Bridge, Robbie tries to gauge the quality of his passenger's silence. He is biting his thumb, teeth worrying the scraps of flesh around the nail, his smoker's tell-tale. After all these years he still find\u2019s James's face hard to ignore. It\u2019s not what Robbie understands as \"handsome\", too raw, too unfinished. It gives so much away and yet so little. But his eyes always refuse to slide away from it.\"If we knew what we were looking for - the photographs, I mean. - the ones you said Dunn had...of you -\" Robbie feels his voice trail away and his face burn as if it were his own privacy he was stripping away.James pulls at the shirt, which has ridden up once more, exposing the violet dip of navel, and a wandering trail of pale hair, and stares fixedly at the crowds surging ahead of them. \"Don't get over excited. I wouldn't want them pinned on the station notice board, but they're just arty rubbish, something Mickey wanted to try. I had a guitar, Micky had a camera, and we both had too much time on our hands. Shit,\" he looks down at his hand; he's torn the thumb nail to the quick. \"I posted some of them to a dating site once, as an experiment.\"\"Did it work?\"\"Look. Why don't we talk about you and Laura, instead? Hmm? Just how is she in the sack? Always imagined she'd be a screamer - .\"\"Jesus! -\" Rubber squeals on tarmac as Robbie brakes. \"James!\"\"It's. Is. Private. Ok?\"\"Ok. I get it. Just don't do that while I'm driving!\" He mouths an apology to the cyclist he almost shunted into the gutter, and gets the finger in return.In seven years Robbie has never seen James unbutton. He is always armoured in uncreased wool cotton and silk, the merest inch of skin emerging from collar and cuff. Off duty he wears his hood up and his sleeves down, on the warmest day, or the longest night, his angular physicality blurred by layer upon layer of time-softened jersey.He drives the rest of the way in silence, paying meticulous attention to the road.157 Isis Way turns out to be a smoke stained Victorian red brick house, set well back from the road by a curved pot-holed drive, screened by laurels, and stinking of long institutional decay. The brass name plate has been polished away to illegibility but the great bell pull beside it triggers a memory, \u201cI know this place,\u201d he says. \"Used to be a refuge for troubled girls.\"James cracks the passenger door, \"And now it's a refuge for runaway priests.\"\"This is where you met Dunn?\" James nods and starts to unfold. Robbie reaches across to take his arm, to stay him. \"James. You have to know - what's happened. What you said this morning. It doesn't change a thing.\"\"You're wrong,\" He gently disengages Robbie's hand. \u201cIt changes everything.\" He climbs out of the car, staring at the blank windows above, as if on the verge of a step from which there could be no return. \"You'd better come in with me, sir. There's someone you should meet.\"\n", "14": "\nChapter Text\nFather Meredith Waite is as sick a man as any Robbie has encountered in his life to date. The founder of St Anthony's is dozing in a stifling over-heated and under lit room on the second floor, sunken into a waxy bundle of bone and cobweb in the corner of a blanket draped armchair. Some traces of a much more imposing figure remain, sketched in the broad shoulders, the large hand that reaches out on introduction, and in the ropes of yellow skin hanging from arms from which muscle has melted like the tallow of a candle. Everything else is so colourless and faded that one might almost see through the man to the tartan weave that cocoons him.The house Waite founded is decaying almost faster than he has.The door was answered by a young African in a Qui Gong t-shirt, who introduced himself as \"Father Adejole - at least, I'm still a Father for the time being, but you can call me Ade!\"The hall beyond him was barely lit by the coloured glass above the door, and its far end disappeared into an impenetrable gloom. Robbie retains an impression of scuffed cream paint and brown linoleum and an institutional perfume of cheap soap, fried fish and wax.\"Mind your step, gentlemen,\" sings Adejole as Robbie barks his shins on a cardboard box piled with dusty children's toys and video tapes. He squints at the label: 'St Faith's Summer Fete - 23 June 2012'. He can hear male voices, the grumble of a conversation, a clatter of dishes somewhere at the back of the house that suggests a kitchen. Adejole has a dishcloth thrown over one shoulder, a fleck of soap stands out on his forearm.\"No lights in here.\" their guide sings out as he leads them up a broad flight of stairs, \"the washing machine exploded last night. Very spectacular - blew all the fuses in the building\". On the half landing a glazed blue and yellow plaster Virgin presides over more jumble, and walls papered with yellowing blue-tacked flyers; Citizens Advice Bureau, Isis Health Centre, Oxford City Council, Job Seekers Plus.\"Father Waite is in his room along here,\" the corridor recedes into darkness on both ends, \"I'll just check he's awake - He's not been at all well, but he does love a bit of company when he's up to it - what did you say your names were again?\"James pulls Robbie aside on the threshold, \"I'd better speak to him first.\" His face is pale in the half-light, waxy and green.\"Don't be daft. You're on administrative leave. Innocent will have my guts if she finds out you're interviewing a potential witness instead of home watching Jeremy Kyle.\"\"He's old and he's sick, and this will hit him hard. At least let me break the news - then he's all yours, I promise. \"Father Adejole ducks back through the door, and ushers them in.The atmosphere strikes Robbie like a physical blow, a thick fug, fuelled by an old fashioned gas fire and ripe with unburnt gas, stale coffee and the stench of approaching death.The old man's greeting is a deep rumble of disbelief and affection, which sets his raised arms trembling - \"James! You came... who is this with you? Inspector Lewis? I am pleased to meet you at last. Adejole - go see if Mr Patterson has arrived with our new fuses. So, gentlemen is this a social call,\" his bright eyes flicker from one man to the other and narrow, \"or, \" his voice hardens, \"more in the line of business?\"\"Business,\" Robbie pauses, \"Inspector Hathaway has some bad news I'm afraid.\u201dA flush Robbie identifies as gratitude briefly colours James's cheeks as he crouches close to Waite's chair, and takes the old man's withered hand.\"Father -\u201d\"Tell me\"\"Michael Dunn was found dead, early this morning,\" he says.\"Ach!\" Waite's frame shakes as if swallowing something strong and bitter, \"his poor, poor wife - he had married, did you know? I am told she is very young? A terrible, terrible thing. How did he die?\" James looks across at Robbie, who shakes his head. Be careful.\"We can't be certain yet - but it's possible someone else was involved.\"The old Priest crosses himself, and bends his head over his joined hands. \"Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat ei...\"Prayers for the dead mean nothing to Robbie except the sounds of strangers soothing their own discomfort He folds his own hands, and fights his irritation when James joins in, in a language used only to remind ordinary men and women that they don\u2019t measure up.\"Pater, deleo. Ego infirmus sum\u201d\u00a0\"No, no. Compar, culpa mea est.\"**James gently extricates his hand, from the old man's trembling paw. \"Father. Inspector Lewis has to ask you some questions about Michael - he needs to know if he spoke to you or anyone else at the House last night.\"\"Last night? But I haven't seen Dunn in years.\"James looks momentarily both puzzled and relieved. \"I thought perhaps, last night...?\"\"He was invited, of course - \"\"\"Wait\" Robbie cuts in, sharply, \"Dunn was expected here last night.\" James has enough conscience to blush, at the revelation of his omission.\"We invite all our Alumni to the annual vigil - on Holy Thursday. Not all attend, obviously.\" Is it Robbie's imagination, or does James flush even darker as if rebuked. \"Dunn was not here.\"\"Are you sure?\"I'm dying, not senile. It was a memorable enough evening, what with the explosion and sudden darkness, and not so large a gathering that I would miss a man's absence.\"\"What was the reason for this vigil?\"\"I suppose you have some idea of the date?\"Robbie is tempted to answer The World Snooker Championship, Sheffield, are you a fan?\u00a0 \u00a0\"I may be a heathen Father, but even I know it's Easter.\u201d\"And yesterday evening?\"\"Maundy Thursday.\" All leave was been cancelled last year, when the Queen visited Oxford for the Maundy Service. For Robbie, after thirty years of policing the city's pageantry it was just another procession, all velvet and sashes, and picturesque nonsense about silk purses being given to old ladies in new hats. \"The commemoration of the Last Supper.\"\"It\u2019s also the evening that Chrism oil is blessed. The Last Supper was also the First Communion, given by Our Lord to the men who would become His first priests. When He took bread and wine in His hands, and transformed them into His own body and blood, Our Lord began a succession of that continues unbroken to this day.\" The old man stretches out his own trembling hands to Robbie, palm up. \"When I was ordained, many years ago, these were anointed with Chrism, by a Bishop whose hands were in turn anointed by another, and so on in an unbroken line to the hands that broke bread together on that Last and First night.\"Robbie James's palms, stretched out to CSE to be swabbed.\"Inspector Lewis, you must try to understand this to understand a man like Dunn, like the others who have taken shelter in this house over the past few years.\" Like James, you mean. \"A Priest is not a mere stand-in for Our Lord at the Altar - a holy stunt man. He is, at that moment, the vessel of Christ Himself, at work in the world. A Priest does not say \"This is the Body of Christ\" but \"\"this is my body\u00a0which will be given up for you\". Consider the dangers and doubts and hubris a man risks when he believes he is called to Priesthood - and imagine the wrenching pain when he falls short in his own estimation. He is alone, he falls prey to solitary fear, to despair, to self-hatred, even perhaps to self-murder\" There are tears shining on the withered cheeks. \"That is why I open my doors, last night as every night - for those who seek forgiveness.\"James takes the old man's hand and kisses it, reverently. \"Adsum. Audio. Manebo.\"***Robbie is to realise, many years later, that until that afternoon in the stuffy little room in North Oxford, he had never really taken that other James seriously. James the Priest who-might-have been. Once or twice might have glimpsed that disquieting stranger - in the line of folded hands and downcast eyes at the end of the long night at his desk, or an expression frozen in the lens of a photographer waiting on the steps of a court room. But he has always shied away from examining that uncomfortable recognition more closely, and filed away that year in the seminary as an youthful aberration, a n awkward phase, like Mark \"finding himself\" in a Bondi beach-bar, or that time Lynn decided she was to be a ballet dancer and didn't eat chips for a month.James was just too smart, too talented, too full of sense and good humour to have been taken in by this dreary world of dust and superstition and secret languages.But his belly clenches at the sight of Waite's claw reaching out, pulling his James back into the past, and the nauseous realisation that his friend still wants to be there. He has to speak now, call James back, order him back, into to the real world, he clears his throat.And is interrupted by a soft, brisk knocking and the appearance of a pleasant freckled face around the door. \"Father? You're awake? Just wanted to let you know the new consumer unit can't be delivered until after the holiday, but I've borrowed the generator from St Faiths -- oh, I'm sorry - didn't realise you had company.\"\"Conn! The hero of the hour. Come in, come in. Inspector Lewis - this is Conn Patterson, our neighbour and Good Samaritan. I have no idea how this house would stay standing without his assistance. The wiring is older than I am, and in no better shape.\"\"Well, that's what are neighbours are for! Pleased to meet you, Inspector.\" Patterson's handshake is as warm and firm and reassuring as his smile, \"The wife and I live in the bungalow across the way. I lend a hand where I can. Why, bless me - is that Mr Hathaway? It is, it is - we haven't seen you in - oh, I don't know how long. I did hear you were a policeman now?\"\"For my sins.\u201d James rocks back on his heels and stands. Robbie feels a wave of relief.\u00a0 \u201cHow is Mrs Patterson?\"\"So, so - , well you know how it is, but she's good in herself. I'll tell her you asked after her. Oh, Father? That reminds me\" - Patterson places an old fashioned thermos flask on the table, among the litter and bottles of the sick room. \"My Maureen made you some coffee, strong, and black, just the way you like it. Keep you going until I can get some kind of power on again. Now, all I need if a couple of strong backs and arms to lift the Jenny from the back of the van - is Father Adejole about?\"Robbie seizes the opening, \"Inspector Hathaway, would you - ?\" and is relieved that James nods with the near telepathic agreement of old - although there is that same odd flush of embarrassment and gratitude, high on each cheeks.\"No, no Mr Hathaway, I can't drag you away like this..?\"\"Don't you worry,\" Robbie says, \"I'll keep Father Waite company for a bit.\"The door closes behind James and Patterson, and Robbie feels himself on surer ground again.\n", "15": "\nChapter Text\n\n\"Inspector. I can at last offer you some semblance of hospitality. Could I trouble you to pour us both some of the excellent Mrs Patterson's coffee? There should be some clean mugs on the table. I take it black.\"\nAs he pours, Robbie quickly notes the labels on the bottles and boxes on the table, names he recalls from Aunt Cissie's last days. Diazepam, Haloperidol, Docusate, Carbamazepine, a roll call for the dying. The silver bottle is morphine. But no Zolpidem.Waite sniffs the murky brew. \"Yes, I have need of all those pills and potions. I am not a brave man, Inspector; I am preparing myself for death, but I fear pain. At times I grow nostalgic for the dark and bitter joy of my youth, and I dose myself with good strong Italian coffee,\u201c He sips from his mug, and grimaces, \"not that Mrs Patterson knows much about good coffee - but it is made with love, and that's almost better.\u201dRobbie shifts a chair, just a little and sits. From here the dim ivy-shaded light will fall across the old priest's face and not his own, \"What's the diagnosis?\" he asks.\"Thank you - I can't stand people who pussy-foot around sickness. Diagnosis - Cancer of the Pancreas. Prognosis - death, in weeks rather than months.\"\"I'm sorry to hear it.\"\"So much left undone - and yet, I hope to be prepared, at the end. I know what awaits me afterwards. Ah, You are a sceptic, Inspector Lewis. I see it in your face.\"\"I don't mean to be rude,\" Robbie sips his own coffee. It's as bad as Waite implied. \"I see lot of death in my job. I really wish there was something on the far side; but to me it's all just made-up words to help ourselves feel better in the dark; there's no special power in sacred oils, magic rings or fairy stories.\"\"A marriage vow is only words. A ring is just a hoop of metal. Yet I see you wore a wedding ring for many, many years - and removed it very recently, with great care and pain, it seems to me. So perhaps there is a power in words and things, if only to remind us of what we value.\"Robbie resists the urge to hide his hand from those sharp little eyes. It\u2019s been three months since he stood over the bathroom sink wrestling with soap and gritted teeth. The ring now lies in the dark, in a drawer with Val's scarves and glasses and lipstick and keys, but the ridge of callus and fish-belly soft skin it left behind has barely faded.\"I can't know what it cost you to remove the outward sign of your promise,\" the old man continues, \"but I do know what it is to have suffered loss, to learn that you do not have the strength to live up to the standards you set, or that the plans of divine providence do not match your hopes. I have made it my life's work to minister to those who doubt their vocation, to travel in companionship with them, to listen and not condemn.\"\"You must hear many secrets in your line of work, Father.\"\"As you must in yours, Inspector.\"\"Aye, I do. Secrets that kill.\"\"And you think I might help you uncover the secrets that killed Michael Dunn.\"\"Maybe. His secrets - or other peoples. Maybe someone he met here?\" Robbie decides to rattle Waite a little \"we know Dunn was blackmailing at least one person associated with St Anthony's. Maybe more than one. It would help to know why he was here, and who he was in contact with.\"\u201c- and the little weaknesses a blackmailer might identify and exploit?\"\"Yes.\"\"Inspector, really; Dunn may have abandoned his vows, but I have not. I know I cannot reveal what I hear in the Sacrament of Penance...\"The irritation which has been simmering in Robbie since James brought into this darkened rotting place erupts. \"Don't try that nonsense about Confession on me. I don't care what promises you made to God or Dunn, or the Tooth Fairy. A man is dead, in horrible circumstances, and I have made a promise to his wife to find out why. Does she deserve your help any less than your troubled Priests?\"\"Even so - I am bound by my vows.\"\"Priest-Penitent Privilege has no standing in English law -\u201d\"And I will shortly face a judgement more terrifying and final than any you can bring me to, Inspector, and far sooner! Oh, do sit down. Your pacing makes me dizzy. I have every intention of helping you - and poor Mrs Dunn - as far as I am able. Luckily for both of us, Dunn's disappointment with Church discipline is a matter of public record. He wrote at length to the Catholic Herald while he was here, the correspondence was published in - oh, when would it be, let me think -November 2003?\"He was a very angry young man when I first met him; He had been raised in the Church of England - his father was a Vicar - and converts, in my experience, are prone to a rigid orthodoxy, and are often profoundly disillusioned when they realise how fallible the rest of us are.\"\"Why did he convert? Inspector Hathaway said something about women vicars.\"\"Yes indeed - he was one of number of men and women who converted when our Anglican brethren first ordained women. He believed it was an insuperable heresy; Our Lord came to us a man, chose men as His apostles and first Priests. How then could a woman ever stand at the altar and say \"this is my body, this is my blood' and not incite the most disquieting images in the mind the hearer? You roll your eyes, at me, Inspector but these are Dunn's words, not mine, and you need to understand him. He was driven to abandon not only the faith of his childhood, and his preparations to follow his father into to Church - but also to set aside his fianc\u00e9e, and his hopes of a family life, to follow his calling to serve the Lord. Imagine the strength. Imagine the pain.\"\"I'd imagine the girl found it pretty painful at well.\"\"I don't doubt that for a moment.\"\"So what changed - why did he end up here, ten years later?\"\"Dunn was just one of those who sought asylum amongst us then and since. The Church has welcomed them, accommodated them - even those already ordained as Anglican priests. Married Priests. With families.\"\"Ah... \"\"Quite. It can be disconcerting for an ancient Priest like myself to meet new colleagues with wives and a presbytery overflowing with the laughter of children - refreshing even. But for Dunn, it seemed a terrible betrayal. He had not compromised, he had paid the terrible price demanded - and now he saw the Church compromising itself to provide work and homes for his contemporaries, men who had sat on the fence long enough to obtain what he had sacrificed. He did what he had done before when reality did not match his expectation. He quit.\"\"And ended up here.\"\"With no career, no income, no savings, no home, no family, - just a burning sense of injustice and self-pity. He brooded in his room, rehearsing his grievance over and over again.\u201cI hoped - well, when James arrived a few weeks later, he seemed a breath of fresh air. Full of life and humour and music. I hoped that he would be a positive influence. And I do believe he was - Dunn stopped writing to the Herald and took up photography. Eventually he got a bit of work through a local studio, helping out at weddings. He moved out, moved on, started a new life.\u201d The old man pauses, his eyes suddenly dim and wandering. \u201cForgive me, I grow weary. My desires outrun my strength. I must rest.\u201dThe mug in the old man\u2019s hand slips to one side. Robbie catches it before it can spill, gently disentangling it from the clawed fingers and placing it in the table. He smooths the rug over the bony knees.\"Tell me, Inspector,\u201c Waite\u2019s eyes glitter, but Robbie must lean in to hear \u201cJames. Is he fulfilled? In this other life he has chosen? Is he happy?\u201d\u00a0\"I hope so.\"Waite sighs, and squeezes his eyes shut. \"So do I. He would have gone far in the Church, perhaps all the way to Rome. He would have been an exceptional Priest.\"\"He is an exceptional policeman. An exceptional man.\"Robbie waits. After a few minutes the eyelids start to flutter, as the dreams and memories behind them shift and turn. Robbie tucks the tartan rug over the sleeping man's knees, and goes to find his partner.\n", "16": "\nChapter Text\nThere is no one on the stairs, nor on the ground floor. The house is as empty and silent as a gourd, only the gurgling of distant plumbing to suggest it is not utterly abandoned.With a hiss the fluorescent tube over Robbie's head flickers into life. Somewhere close by a forgotten radio snaps back into life, and Britney is caught pleading Hit me, baby, one more time... He follows the sound of the generator, thump, thump, thump, through the empty kitchen, down a short flight of steps to dank utility room and through an open door into sunlight, where he finds Patterson wiping his hands on a rag and looking at the chugging generator with the satisfaction of a job well done.\"That should keep them going for a day or two. At least I can pick up a new consumer board. That old one is lethal. Been here since before the Nuns moved in, I shouldn't wonder.\" He inspects the cable he has fed through the window into the dank utility room. \"Fair enough, as long as they don't try to run that old washing machine. It\u2019s almost as old as the wiring, and twice as dangerous; leaks as fast as it fills. This was a mother and baby home see, masses of laundry the Sisters had back then, garden full of nappies and sheets every day the sun shone. All gone wild now. That's our bungalow over the wall there. \" He closes and locks the back door\" I used to help the sisters out with the garden, and the heavy lifting, just to be neighbourly, but I've not the strength now. Need to save it for the wife. She's been a bit under the weather. Best get back, before she worries.\" Patterson starts to pack away his tools.\"You were here last night?\"\"For the vigil? No. I don't go in for that sort of stuff. The wife does, but... no, I heard the bang, saw the lights go out, and said Maureen, old girl, you'll have to look after yourself for an hour or two while I sort the old boys out again.\"\"You must have seen a lot of coming and going over the years. \"\"True. Can you pass me that wrench?\"\"Did you know a Michael Dunn?\"Patterson shakes his head slowly, \"Doesn't ring a bell. Did he stay here?\" He pulls the door shut and locks it.\"About the time Inspector Hathaway would have been here.\"\"Oh, now, see, who could forget Mr Hathaway! Weird looking lad, but lovely, friendly, not like some.\"\"Dunn shared a flat - \"\"Oh him! Mickey.\" Patterson closes his tool box with a snap. \"Bit of a loner, kept to his room. Haven't seen him in years. \" Patterson stands, toolbox in hand \"He in trouble?\"\"He's dead.\"\"No! So young? I'm sorry to hear it. Now, I have to lock up, if you don't mind. \u00a0Can't linger.\"\"I'll just wait for Inspector Hathaway.\"\"Oh, he's away with Ade and the others, won't be back in a while\" Robbie feels the damp concrete tilt beneath his feet as Patterson continues, \"It went clean out of my head, he left a message: Thanks for the lift, and not to worry, he'll be staying here a night or two.\"Robbie swears. Patterson looks both shocked and amused.\"Don't you worry, Inspector Lewis. It\u2019s what they do here all the time, take in folk. Spartan mind. Not what I'd chose, if I had a friend to go to. Mind your step.\" They are almost at the front door.Robbie fishes out his card, \"If you remember anything out the ordinary, about Dunn, or what happened last night - ring me.\"\"Fair enough, \"Patterson pops the card in his pocket, and the tool box in the basket of an old bicycle leaning against the porch. \"Look, Father Waite is a good man, but, well - they are all a bit potty around here, if you ask me. It\u2019s not natural is it, living all cooped up like that, too much in their own heads. I couldn't manage without my Maureen and she couldn't manage without me. These others - well, you wonder what they are running from, don't you? Will you pull the door too when you leave. Cheerio, Inspector. \" And he wheels the bicycle off down the drive into the spring afternoon.The sunlight is warm in Robbie's face. His neck prickles as if he is being watched, but when he turns all the windows are blank and dead. He wonders if James is hiding behind one of them.The phone at his hip buzzes, and even before he reads the number, he recalls his promise to collect Laura, and swears, softly.\n", "17": "\nChapter Text\n\nHe hears her laughter first, deep and throaty, with a thread of mischief running through it that takes him straight back to smoky saloon bars full of ghosts a decade dead.\nSiobhan Maitland has aged well, Robbie decides. Better than he has. Her hair is still dark, shorter than it was, cut to curl behind her ears. The trench coat, hanging open over trousers and a crisp white shirt, looks expensive. She probably turns as many heads in Manchester nick now as she ever did here as a sergeant.Now she's head to head with Laura, laughing - flirting, he suspects, and Laura's smile is wide and genuine. It widens further as she glimpses him in the doorway, as if he has just walked in as the punch line of a joke.\"A familiar face at last.\" Maitland's handshake is firm and warm.Just flirting. Laura would never share her secrets to shame him, not even in the mysterious masonic circle of female friendship. He knows this. He is certain. He is however relieved when she is called away to sign off her autopsy results.\"I was so sorry to hear about Vivian.\"\"Valerie.\"Maitland's mouth twists a little in embarrassment and apology. \"God. That was awkward.\"\"It\u2019s Ok. You hardly knew her.\"\"I remember her though. I liked her.\"\"Thank you.\"\"Anyway, you've saved me a journey; I heard you were at home, I was on my way to visit. Do you have time for a chat - maybe a drink?\"\"Another time, I promised Doctor Hobson a lift home.\"Maitland lifts an eyebrow, and Robbie blushes like an idiot.\"Running away with my Pathologist straight after spiriting away my chief suspect. Tut tut, Robbie.\"Robbie stiffens, \"Is DI Hathaway a suspect?\"\"Hey, Robbie - calm down, it was a joke. I've hardly had time to read the reports yet. Its just - he was your bagman, I wanted your opinion.\"Robbie frowns. \"He's a good policeman, and a better detective.\"\"That's what your Super said - it just seems a bit odd, such a good detective stumbling off the fast track, kicking his heels as your errand boy for seven years. Problems fitting in? God knows, I understand how hard that can be. 'God-Bothering College Bum Boy,' that's what DS Hooper called him.\"\"Not how I'd put it, but yeah, can't say Hooper's wrong.\"\"Wouldn't have thought he was your type at all. Or were you just following the patent Morse approach to mentoring and keeping him locked up in the basement?\"\"Look, Siobhan. We've known each other too long. I'm not playing this game. You have Hathaway's statement. If you find evidence that contradicts that in any way, I'll be right there with you. Until then - you've got plenty of other leads to eliminate.\"\"Where would you start?\"\"The boy who reported the body.\"Maitland smiles \"Morse's Law. More often than not the first person to see the victim dead is the last person to see then alive.\" As I remember it, Morse was wrong about as often as he was right.\"\"But never for long. And he was right about you, Siobhan - he said you'd go far.\"\"Now, why do I get the feeling that wasn't his idea of a compliment?\"\"So, did you speak to the boy?\"\"He has a water-tight alibi - Dixieland Chicken has CCTV covering all the tills. He was dishing out the fries from ten to one-thirty, with a five minute break at 12.10, when he visited the employee washroom. He didn't wash his hands, by the way.\"\"He's a peeping Tom - maybe he saw more than he is willing to admit to.\"\"Look, Robbie, this is my case now. And I can't afford to get sentimental just because a man with means and motive happens to be one of us. No one enjoys this - but you now you have to step away now, and let me do my job.\" She steps back, hands deed in the pockets of her trench as Laura appears, her arms full of files. \"Good to meet you, Laura.\"\"Likewise. Robbie, can you take these staff reports a moment.\" She starts to pull on her coat. \"We should have dinner some time.\"\"I'd like that. Once all this unpleasantness is over - you, me and Robbie. Congratulations, by the way. You make a lovely couple.\"\n", "18": "\nChapter Text\n\n\"She's right you know,\" Laura says, as they sit waiting for the lights to change, indicator ticking away the seconds.\n\"About us being a lovely couple?\"\"About you staying out of the investigation. You\u2019re far too close.\"Amber, green; Robbie eases off the clutch, finds the bite, and swings out into the clots and eddies of holiday traffic. \"Did she warn you off sharing information with me?\"\"She didn't have to. There are lines, Robbie, and I can\u2019t cross them, even for you. Even for the divine Hathaway.\"\"What do you think I'd do - help Hathaway dispose of the evidence? Laura, after all these years, you hardly know me at all.\"\"Don't be stupid.\" She's hurt, he can tell. \u00a0Her silence crackles around the car. A thread of pain pulses in his temple; too little sleep, too little coffee. Or too much.He glances at the clock. Almost four. Twenty-four hours ago they were sipping a last espresso in Pisa airport, using up the loose change. In silence, then as now, the unspoken thing between them curdles the sunlight.They took the thing to Italy with them, still unnamed, because Italy meant light and warmth and wine and long lie-ins in fresh linen. And they dragged it home again, still nameless, still bundled tightly, wailing, in the dark. Round and round it goes, like the unclaimed suitcase found on every baggage carousel, unclaimed.Four. He cracks on the radio to catch the local traffic update, to break the silence.And immediately wishes he hadn't.\n\u2026..The discovery early this morning of a body in wasteland bordering the popular Fry's Hill retail park has prompted questions about the policing of the area among local residents.\n\n\"You don't know what to think, do you? I've seen all sorts hanging out in that car park, all hours of the day. Our kids cut through there all the time. We don't feel safe anymore.\"\n\nTensions have risen over the Fry's Hill site for several months, with Oxford's gay community accusing site developers Connolly Contraction of involvement in a number of assaults on gay courting couples.\n\n\"We warned that this would happen. Connolly's security has been heavy handed in dealing with users of the site, while using homophobic language to scare local residents. It was just a matter of time before the violence got out of hand. Fry's Lane was a well-known and safe meeting spot long before Connolly bought it. We've tried to work with the Police to make it safe for all users, they wouldn't listen, and now a man is dead.\"\n\nWe spoke to David Connolly, owner of Connolly Construction by phone. \"This has nothing to do with homophobia. I am not homophobic. We do not discriminate. But we are talking here about a tiny minority of adults engaging in unsavoury activities just a few yards from family restaurants and children's entertainment. This tragic incident simply underlines the concerns of our customers - decent hard-working Oxford residents, gay and straight.\"\n\nThe dead man was named this afternoon as local photographer and married man, Michael Dunn. Police are keen to speak to anyone who was in the Fry's Hill area last night and might have vital evidence, but have refused to speculate on the possibility of a vigilante attack. This morning, independent sources reported that an unnamed individual with connections to Oxford City Police, was helping police with their enquiries, but has since been released pending further investigation\n\nAnd now, over to Jo, with the weather for the holiday weekend...\nLaura snaps the radio off. \"How is he?\"\"Staying with friends.\" He should call the address in. \"You know. Churchy types.\"\"Oh well, better than the two of you brooding together.\"\"I don't brood! Do I brood?\"\"Like a northern sky, my love.\"\"You know, the sun does sometimes take a peek at the world north of Nottingham!\"\"You can't fool me, Robert Lewis; I once spent a week in Filey. Needed headlight at midday. In August.\"James will call it in, won't he? He doesn't have a phone. St Anthony's must have a phone. There was a payphone in the hall. And the internet. Even monks have the internet these day. That young priest, Adejole, he looked like the sort to have an iPhone in his back pocket. James will call in his contact details. It\u2019s not as he hiding. It's not as if he has anything to hide. Except whatever it is he hasn't told me.\"It's only for tonight... he'll be back home tomorrow. Soon as Maitland's cleared his flat - Damn it!\" Robbie thumps the the steering wheel.\"What?\"\"Sorry Laura - in all of this, I forgot your case is still back at my place. Want me to turn round?\"\"It's only dirty laundry and flip-flops. I can live without that for a day or two. I liked her.\"\"Siobhan Maitland? I could tell.\"\"Not like that. Idiot. She's tough, must be to have got where she is in your gang...\"\"Hey!\"\"She's still passionate about the job.\"\"Yeah. I've always liked her too...\"\"But...? Oh come on, Robbie, spit it out. You're worried. You have been since you saw her.\"\"Maitland's a good copper. You're right, she's tough, she's smart, she cares - it's just, sometimes she cares too much, and starts to bends the rules to get what she knows is the right result. Here we are - door to door service.\"There is yellow and green nodding outside Laura's house, where only bare earth lay when he picked her up two weeks before. Spring manages to surprise him every year, even now, after half a century. Winter seems unending then, suddenly, daffodils.He kills the engine, turns the key over and over in his hand. Laura waits. She has become something of an expert in patience.\u201cLaura. You don't really believe James is capable of murder?\"\"God yes. Don't you?\"\"Of course not! This is James we\u2019re talking about!\"\"If someone threatened the people he cares for? Frankly I'd rather face a mother tiger than get in Hathaway's path if you were in danger. Or vice versa, for that matter.\"\"Don't be daft - that's just the job, we look out for each other. The real killers are out there, not in here.\"\"I know. I do know. I live with every day, Robbie. Every day, every call in, I half expect it to be someone I know, James, or - you - under the sheet.\"\"Laura -\u201d\"Sometimes I dream it.\"\"Hey - I'm not decrepit yet.\"\"Robbie - will you see a doctor. Please.\" She staring down at the reports piled in her lap.\"I thought I was seeing one - a kinky one who dreams about me. Naked.\u00a0 On her slab.\u201d\"It's not a joke. Please. For me. Just to make sure there's nothing physically wrong.\"And now it\u2019s out, off the baggage carousel, that extra bit of baggage they\u2019ve been dragging about.\u00a0 His baggage.\"Laura , not now - it's been a bugger of day.\"\"It\u2019s always a bugger of a day. Except when we're on holiday, when its lovely and neither of us want to spoil the mood. Robbie, it\u2019s not... I\u2019m not disappointed -\u201d\"Yes,\" He says \"yes, you are, and you should be. I'm sorry.\"\"Don't. Erectile dysfunction...\"\"Laura!\"\"Oh grow up Robbie! You aren't nine years old. Use the right words for the right things. Erectile dysfunction is nothing to be ashamed of ; but it can be a symptom of other issues - diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure\u2026 \"\u201cMy heart is fine. It's just - well, you know, in an old house, sometimes the plumbing and wiring can be a bit underpowered.\"\"So you call in a plumber or an electrician - oh god, you've got me doing it now! You call in a specialist.\u00a0 Make an appointment to see your doctor. Please. For my sake.\"\"Ok. Laura.\" He sighs and takes her hand. \"Love. Whatever it takes. I just want you to know - \u00a0it's not you.\u00a0 It\u2019s never been you.\"Laura squeezes her eyes shut, and her fingers tight around his. \"I\u2019m almost half hoping it is me - because if it isn't, it\u2019s you, and I really don\u2019t want to find you on my slab any day soon. God, I'm sorry. That was really crappy timing. You\u2019re right; it\u2019s been a bugger of a day.\" She drops a kiss on his cheek and releases his hands to open the car door. \"Go home and get some sleep. All of this will look better in the morning.\"He waits until she has closed the door, until light shows behind the kitchen blind. Then he starts the car and drives back into the heart of the city.\n", "19": "\nChapter Text\n\nRobbie tosses keys and envelope onto the table, next to the heap of bills and flyers which drifted and spread behind the front door over the two weeks of his absence. The cases still stand against the wall, just where they were dropped last night. Without conscious thought he thumbs on the television. Light and sound to fill his home, the sing-song of an auctioneer flogging family silver.\nThe envelope just sits there. Mute. The loudest thing in the room.Has he eaten since the flight? That little pack of pretzels he remembers, a greasy warm panini left half-finished on his tray, over chilled apple juice. He vaguely recalls a ham sandwich abandoned on his desk when Innocent's PA had rung through. It's probably still there.He opens the fridge. A single sagging tomato winks back at him. An open pack of Cheddar. A jar of mustard. No milk, of course.\u00a0 Five bottles of beer. That'll do. He pops a lid. That, and something from the freezer.The envelope is waiting.He sits, bottle in hand, willing the microwave to chime.He found it in the passenger footwell, a plain unmarked manila A4 envelope, fallen from Laura's lap, he assumed, as she climbed out. His heart leaps, she must need this, he can drive back to Wheatley, with her case and a peace offering - a bottle of wine?\u00a0It's unlabelled, anonymous - he slides out the first few inches to peek - and freezes. Ridiculously he checks the street, left and right for curious eyes, twitching curtains. No one has seen him. He slides the envelope under his arm and hurries indoors, as if carrying a bottle through the green channel, or dodgy magazine past his mam.Oh. Laura. So much for lines uncrossed.Now it sits unopened on his table, next to his keys, ticking like a bomb.It's a thick photocopy of the first draft Forensic file; Autopsy, SOCO, CSE. Slightly askew, as if run through the sorter in haste, as might happen if one were gathering up files, pulling on a coat, keeping an open eye for curious colleagues.When he opens the envelope again, he will be the one crossing a line.\u00a0In Laura's nightmare she finds her scalpel poised over the flesh of friends, folding back skin and sinew to reduce their complexity to so many cold cut of labelled meat.In Robbie's, he peels back paper and pathologises their existence, the cracks, the stains, the greasy marks of ordinary messy lives, made criminal and shameful by exposure to the light.The forensic eye incriminates us all.The hysterical cackling of a studio audience masks the sound of sliding paper. Some quiz show.\u00a0 He lied to me. He looked me in the eye, promised to tell me everything. He lied.\nIf I look, he need never know.\nHe slides out the thick wedge of paper, and turns over the first sheet, and starts to work through it, methodically, works his way through the pile, page by page, image by image, item by item.- The contents of every cabinet and cupboard, every drug, soap, salve and poison, listed A to B to C...

Divine Comedy: Inferno\nCanto VI l 1-6\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\u00a0\nThe dreamer wakes from a sleep of terror, darkness and pursuit, shuddering, heart pounding, breath ragged and opens his eyes into a darkness as total as the vault of his own skull.\nThere had been stairs, and bridges, and tunnels, and cellars, the roots of the city opening up endlessly under his feet, and at every landing, junction and doorway, It was always there ahead of him. It, the Beast, the low, lean, starved creature, padding through the long limitless night ahead of him, behind him, beside him, baring its teeth in a rank snarl and driving him onwards in fear, down, down, down until air and sun and stars faded from conscious recall\nRobert Lewis, jerked into wakefulness, feels the thudding of his heart quieten, until he can again hear his own house around him, dark, silent, except for the tick-tick of the hot water tank, and the sound of traffic on the distant ring-road, like the sea.\nHe runs a hand through his hair. He needs a piss and drink to swill the clag of sleep from his mouth. He levers himself up, off the sofa, swinging his bare feet down to the floor - and into two inches of frigid water.\nThere is no light in the room. Not so much as the swing of passing headlights on the ceiling. He swears and stumbles, feet sliding in cold, sodden shagpile, bruising his hip on the table, reaching for the front door, for the light switch.\nThere are a few scant seconds in which his half-woken brain screams out the utter stupidity of what he is about to do, of the current lurking in the copper wires waiting to leap from his sweating palm to his wet feet and light him up like a candle.\nToo late. The switch snaps downwards, his heart leaps in its cage. And nothing follows. No light. No power. No sudden deep-fried death. Just a dull click.\nA burst pipe, a blown fuse, and cold water dripping down onto his bowed head and neck.\nHis phone. There is a light on his phone, enough to find a path into the kitchen, to the tool box, to his jacket and the torch he keeps there. He gropes back toward the table.\nThe Beast crouching beneath the table growls, long and low, and bares its teeth.\nThe dreamer stumbles, fleeing, downwards, always downward, thrashing thigh deep through dank water, thick cloying, stinking, unlit mud, into the roots, the foundations, cellars that have never seen sunrise, where forgotten men lie chained, nameless, loveless, eyeless, and paw with feeble hands at those who pass on.\nAnd always, at his heels, the stalking beast.\nSomething catches the hem of his gown. It rips. It tangles. It forces him to his knees, jarring his hands. He kicks, and tears and crawls, but he is held fast. At any moment he will feel the fetid smoking breath on his face, and long teeth meeting in the soft flesh of his belly and groin. He raises despairing hands to beat it away...\n... and seizes instead the head of a man, charred and cracked. Blue eyes burning in a waste of crusted skin. Blackened maw opening wide, spilling dust and a voice as dry as sand. \u201cLewis! What brings you here?\"\nHe peers into the ruined face, and breathes Sir. Is this really you, here, sir?\u201d\nThe old man, once his master, turns, glancing right, then left, then hisses \u201cHe watches well who notes well what he sees: who led you here?\"\nA sound like bees fills his ear, deafening him.\nA light like needles fills his eye, blinding him.\nHe cannot tear his face and hands away from the burning thing, still mouthing words he can no longer hear.\nAnd Robbie Lewis wakes again, on his hands and knees on the living room carpet, the dry carpet, face pressed to the television screen, his eyes full of hot grainy meaningless images.\nThe clock on the VCR flashes. 03.14. 03.15. 03.16.\nHe rocks back. The shapes on the screen reassemble into human form. Some 80s sitcom on repeat, that one about a father and son forced to share a flat? Their mouths move, and pout and stretch in wide rictus smiles without sound, triggering some vague sense of familiarity and unease.\nHe wipes his face with a shaking hand.\nHis belly and thighs are damp, sticky, not with blood, as he first half-fears, but with something just as intimate.\nNothing wrong with my plumbing after all,\u00a0he thinks, as he resigns himself to the sleepless hours before dawn. See, Laura - all you needed was to scare the living daylights out of me.\n", "21": "\nChapter Text\nThe house behind the hedge is bland, anonymous. The ground floor blinds are lowered, the door without a number, the bells without names. Just letters - A, B, C. Just one of the thousands of Victorian terraces spreading out from Oxford\u2019s heart, each now subdivided into identical boxes to file away the thousands of aspiring professionals Oxford spawned.There is nothing to suggest the passage of time, the year or even the day. \u00a0The laurel hedge is as dense and dusty in April as it was in December or will be in June, and the ugly lamp over the door still glows in the early morning light.Robbie has been here before, of course he has, on early mornings like this, waiting behind the wheel for the door to open and James to bound down the steps, booted, suited and ready for work.He's been across the threshold too, once or twice, maybe six times in seven years. James doesn't entertain. He brings the beer and the biryani, but it\u2019s always Robbie who provides the plates, the sofa and the remote control.But he does have the keys. Of course he does. He's James's Sexton, as James is his. Every unmarried copper has a Sexton. Many of the married too. The keeper of the keys, with the job of tidying away the uncomfortable details before a grieving mother or child or widow shows up. Last service for the dead. Smoothing out the sheets. Feeding the cat.\u00a0 Cancelling the milk. Spiriting away the stash of porn or pot or whatever other trace evidence that might cause posthumous pain.One bitter winter morning, colder than this, he had set match to paper in Morse's garden, black smoke billowing up into a pale sky, and the curtains of Summertown twitching around him.No one is watching him now. It's just an ordinary suburban Saturday morning. Steam clouding a bathroom window, bacon, toast and Radio 2 on the morning air.This is what Saturdays are for. A breathing space, a roll call of tasks to reset the week to zero, and has been for as long as Robbie can recall.Normal stuff, the small change of life; swap the sheets, sort the laundry into three piles; dark, white and \u00a0dry cleaning. Empty the fridge, empty the bin. Drop off one suit and six shirts, (worn) at Khan's, the dry cleaner in the parade, pick up one suit and six shirts (cleaned, pressed, bagged). Fill the car, fill the fridge. Then a quick trim at Gianni's, which takes a little less time with each passing year.Maybe, he'd thought, that morning, with his neighbours\u2019 windows still in darkness examining his own hollow-eyed reflection, maybe, when he retires, he should take the clippers to what is left up there. Except then, he'd be just all pink, all ears, like a baby\u2019s sippy cup.\u00a0He had sighed, and smoothed his hair down again, and because he couldn\u2019t sleep, and because he has always done these things, every Saturday for almost 30 years, ever since he came out of uniform, whether the house was full of Radio 2 and frying bacon and children's voices, or empty and echoing to every step, he did them again this morning.He had disposed of the leaking tomato in the fridge, the half inch of cheese in the milk carton bought three weeks earlier, and scraped the congealed shepherd's pie into the bin. He had set to one side the suit and shirt and tie he would wear if the phone rang to summon him into work, and to the other the suit and shirts which he would drop off at Khan's.\u00a0 And he had\u00a0emptied his suitcase onto the bed in three piles; dark, white and gifts.As he'd sorted, the bedroom slowly filled with the scent of socks, sun, soap, sweat and cypress leaves.Soap for Lyn, \u00a0in pretty printed paper. A patchwork elephant for Jack. Sweets for Mark, something white studded with hazelnuts, wrapped in the same pretty paper, but already shedding a cloud of icing sugar onto the duvet. Robbie really no longer has any idea what Mark would actually want or need. He\u2019d had a sweet tooth at fifteen, but now? Who knows.And, also, carefully folded into tissue paper, and sealed with the stamp of a tiny boutique opposite Santa Maria Novella, a tie, in sea-green silk, for James.An impulse buy, too extravagant really. James will be expecting a \u201cDuomo-in-a-Snow-Storm\u201d paperweight or a bottle opener with the head of Michaelangelo\u2019s David.\u00a0 Something to add with solemn thanks and appreciation to the tangle of truly, wonderfully awful gifts they have each accumulated in their desk drawers.Embarrassed by its beauty, he pushed the little package out of sight, into his left breast pocket, and decided he would drop it into St Anthony\u2019s later, just to check that James was ok, maybe to offer to clean up the flat once Maitland has cleared it.But it\u2019s still there, an hour later, as he sits outside not the overgrown drive of St Anthony\u2019s, but the bland blue door of number 57, turning his Sexton\u2019s key over and over in his fingers.He has no idea why he is watching the empty flat. \u00a0Some vague half-formed impulse to collect clean clothes and toothbrush, so that the tie can be handed over as an after- thought, but of course that is nonsensical. \u00a0If he were free to collect anything, James would be free to return.\u00a0 He should just drive away and complete the morning\u2019s errands. He even goes so far as to slide his own key into the ignition, before he snatches it back, and jogs across the road and up the cement steps.The flat is lighter than he expected, light streaming in from the garden, through the French windows, pressing damp windblown daffodils against the glass.It smells warm, human. Smoke, aftershave, skin.This is what he needed to see; the whole, the lived in living space. Otherwise those flash-lit flattened images of the SOCO report would haunt him through another night.\u00a0 This is what he does best.\u00a0 He looks, he sees, and, sometimes, he understands.\nHis heart leaps at the shadow outlined on the sofa; hunched shoulder, curved hip, long pale neck, and for a moment he skips the memory of breaking the yellow tape sealing the door, and believes he has intruded on James, still sleeping off the humiliations of the previous day.\nBut it\u2019s just a guitar, laid aside, against the arm of the sofa, waiting to be reclaimed. He brushes it with his fingers as he passes, and the strings shiver and moan in the thick silence.Everywhere there are signs of life in suspension; unwashed plates, empty packaging, full bin, still waiting for Saturday. There's even a pink dry cleaning slip with the loose change on the breakfast bar; Hathaway - 1 suit/6 shirts/heel & resole.And over everything, everywhere, little blue-black smudges of fingerprint powder.There were blue-black stains on Granda Lewis's hands. \"Won't come out, Bobbie Bach,\" he would say, in the sing-song accent he had brought north from the valley of his birth. \"That ol' coal's been working its way in under the skin for 50 years.\"He follows the trail of smudges into the bathroom; \u00a0bath mat askew, a spot of blood on the tiles, a splash on the shower screen. Just a screen. Not a shower curtain, or the absence of a shower curtain. Not that Robbie had ever thought cartoon Hippos would be James's style.As he opens the cabinet over the sink the mirror swings, its reflection panning across the tiles, the open door, the bedroom beyond, throwing each into new configurations.That's what we do, Robbie thinks, when we invade a life like this. We tear it into pieces - photographs, test results, lists, numbers, dates - then rearrange them into new patterns, new stories, testing them - could this be true? Or this? How does that sit within the frame of our knowing?There is of course no Zolpidem on the shelf; he already knows it\u2019s been taken, to be tested, to be matched against the dark grains in Dunn's gut, to the dregs in the unwashed coffee cups.Do we ever really get to the core, the unassailable truth? Robbie thinks of the suitcase he\u2019d tugged from the darkness under Morse's bed, when he\u2019d performed his office as Sexton, an old cardboard thing, as old as Robbie himself, of the magazines folded inside, and the pity and horror that had stirred in him as he turned the pages.He closes the cabinet door. The mirror snaps quietly back into place, his own tired eyes centred in the frame once more.\n", "22": "\nChapter Text\nBut there is nothing hidden under James Hathaway's bed. Not even dust on the hardwood floor.In the drawers - only what one would expect. Underpants, t shirts, socks.On the bed, nothing but two bare pillows and the faintest suggestion of a dent in the stripped mattress, on the side closest to the bedside cabinet.Robbie sits on the bed. The sheets and slips and duvet must be in the lab. Well, one less load of Saturday laundry. He lies down. James's scent envelopes him; bitter smoke, sharp sweat \u00a0and a clean musky sweetness. He closes his eyes and breathes in, the sense that James is lying next to him suddenly so vivid that he almost feels the mattress shift beneath him.He blinks the phantom away. On the cabinet a grey knitted monkey with a ravelled ear, \u00a0wearing a long sash of white plastic beads, a child's first rosary. And a book. Religious art. Saints. He\u2019d seen enough of that in Florence. He flicks through - yes, he'd swear that one looks familiar, a lad tied to a tree, his arms twisted into painful angles, his face turned up the sun, the pale flesh of neck and thigh pierced with arrows, through and through. And all around him life continues oblivious, farmers walking home from the fields, a soldier watering his horse, all turned towards life, away from the boy's lonely agony.He tries to imagine James, lying here, reading this book. Does he sleep as covered up as he lives, buttoned to the neck in pyjamas? Or does that huge mirror on the wall - what, it must for 4 foot square - does the glass reflect James back as no one else is permitted too - naked, tender, exposed. Framed.\"Are you contaminating my crime scene, DI Lewis?\"She's leaning in the doorway, watching him. He curses himself for not hearing, not seeing her there. And how long has she been watching?He strangles an urge to scramble to his feet, swallows his apology, and calmly lays the book aside.\"Is this a crime scene, Siobhan? I haven\u2019t seen anything here to suggest more than a night in with an old friend.\u201dMaitland peels away from the door frame. \"Blood on the table, in the sink.\"\"The blood is Hathaway's - you already know that.\"\"Hathaway says the blood is Hathaway's. I prefer to wait for the DNA results. So what were you looking for?\"She hasn't mentioned the Zolpidem. Of course she hasn't mentioned the Zolpidem, because she should have no idea he knows there was ever Zolpidem here.\"I'm Hathaway's Sexton.\"\"He's not dead. Come on, Robbie, even when you were Morse's whipping boy you were quicker than this.\"He shrugs. \"I needed to see for myself. To understand.\"She nods. \"Me too.\" She sits beside him, forcing him to shift, to give her space.\"So, what's he like? Really. Not what Innocent wants to me know, or what that old sweat Hooper thinks I ought to hear. \"\"Siobhan. Talk to him yourself. Get it over with; interview him, formally, informally, whatever you like. \u201c\"Oh, I tried. Believe me. Drove all the way out, and those old crows at St Anthony refused to admit me to their club for pathetic ex-vicars. 'It's a day of prayer'; \u2018Mr Hathaway is on retreat'; my presence \u2018distresses the residents\u2019. Apparently I need a penis to cross the threshold - or a warrant.\"\"And you need evidence for a warrant...\"\"And at the moment, the victim and this flat are the only evidence I have, so I'm keeping both locked up tight. Look, I understand - colleagues can get very close, feelings get tangled up...\"\"Well, you would know, Siobhan.\"\"And you're still acting like the jealous girlfriend, after all these years. Did I tread on your toes? People used to talk about you and Morse back then, you know, trying to work out why you followed him around like a kicked puppy, panting when he tugged on your leash? Did he make you sit up and beg?\"Robbie's face burns. She's chosen her words careful, watching his reaction to each. Dog, whip, leash. She wants to know if he understands, how much he knew. The suitcase under the bed, the spread flesh, folded and stapled and collared.She bursts out laughing.\"Oh, you should see your face! I'm joking! Robbie Lewis, you're the straightest man I've ever met.\"\"Ha, bloody ha.\"\"It's a compliment. I learned so much from watching you, how much someone so utterly secure in what and who they were could achieve. Strong, honest, straight down the line. You had a hinterland... \"\"A what?\"\"A real life, outside the bloody job. A wife, kids, a home. It made you a better cop than any of the rest of us.\u201d\"Get away with you.\"\"I mean it. It\u2019s important, the people you love, and who love you back.\"\"It's all gone now.\"She shakes her head \"No, it's not. Innocent told me about Jack Cornish. You brought him in. That must have been tough - you were good friends, I remember \u2013 but you brought him in because it was the right thing to do.\"She picks up the little knitted monkey, and looks it in the eye. \"So tell me. What's he like?\u201dRobbie gently takes the toy from her hand.\"Smart. Very. Smarter than Morse. No, really. He reads people better, most of the time. The world isn't a puzzle to him, he understands how it works, how to make it work for him. Sharp as a knife.\"\"Sharp enough to cut?\"\"Only himself. Siobhan - he's the kind of bloke who pushes people out of the path of runaway trains. He's all about saving people, like it\u2019s a mission. For God, from God, I don't know. It's what he is. It's just... Sometime I think he doesn't know how to save himself. What did you call it, that thing you said I had? 'Winterland'?\"Hinterland. The stuff you fall back on, the place you come from.\"\"That's just it - Hathaway's got nothing like that. No family, partner, children, cat. He had God, I suppose, but then he walked away from that .\u201d He carefully sits the monkey and beads back on the closed book, out of harm\u2019s way, and stands, forcing her off the bed with him. \u201cFar as I can tell he hasn't had a home, a real home, since he was twelve. There's just - this-\" His gesture is meant to encompass the whole flat, and everything in it, \u00a0\u201candI think he would walk away from all of this in an instant.\" Well maybe he'd take the guitar. \"So, do you have someone?\"She nods, \"I did. A doctor, as it happens. A shrink. We - ah - split up last year. I gather that conscious uncoupling is the fashionable term.\"\"Kids?\"\"Two of hers. I still see them, from time to time, but they're grown now.\"\"I'm sorry.\"\"Yeah. What happened to us, Robbie?\"\"We just got old. It's our turn to be irrelevant.\"\"You should have left Morse you know. That old man sucked out the best of your life. He'd have done the same for me if I hadn't the guts to move on when I did.\u201d\"It's a pity you didn't have the guts to say goodbye. We just come into work one day, and you're gone again. Transfer application withdrawn. Not a call, not a note, not a letter.\"\"It was better that way, trust me. He never listened to what he didn't want to hear...\"\"He deserved better, Siobhan.\"\"So did we. So do we all.\"Robbie thinks of glossy flesh coloured paper, curling up and away into ash in winter sky.\"Look, Robbie - I may have slept with Morse, and I may have made some bad decisions \u2013 but you never did. No, it\u2019s true. I was on a mission, I needed to save people \u2013 and I had all the knowledge, all the zeal, right on my side. I learned from you \u2013 how to be patient, to wait for the evidence, and then - only then - to act on it.\u201dShe's waiting for her evidence now, the truth of sugar, coffee, blood and semen, to test it against what she knows of the world and the people in it. Just as a good detective should, as he would, as James would.He sighs. \"Alright. I'll speak to Hathaway, get him to talk to you. So you can judge for yourself. And if \u2013 if \u2013 you find any evidence, and you get that warrant, then I'll bring him in myself.\"\n", "23": "\nChapter Text\n\n\"This is not an answering service. No, I'm not going to start running up and down stairs looking for people - what do you think this is? Some kind of student hall? Make an appointment with the office - yes, by email. I'll spell it again: ess-tee-ay-en-tee-aitch-oh-en-two-six-seven at btinternet.com. What? Well I dare say it will be checked by the secretary when he gets back from Tonbridge on Wednesday. This line is for emergencies only. Good day.\"\n\nSo much for modern communications, thinks Robbie, as he slides the phone back into his pocket, and opens the car door. The only other number he has for St Anthony's - presumably the secretary's - just rings out. James's own phone is, of course, sitting in an evidence locker. He'll just have to speak to James the old fashioned way, face to face.\nHe retrieves the bag from the back seat. An offering, not only of the essentials - toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, deodorant - but the right toothpaste, the right shampoo, as if the clinical catalogue of names and quantities in his head is nothing more sinister than a Christmas wish list. The right underpants too; not a pack of four blue cotton bikini briefs like those he's been popping into his basket at M&S every six months since Lyn left home. These are the result of an expedition into Austin Reed on Cornmarket Street, the only place he canthink of, off the top of his head, which would stock Calvin Klein. He hadn't even baulked at the cost, despite wincing as he realised they were \u00a323 each. They'd better be woven from the spun tears of angels to justify that price.\nThe restoration of power, however temporary, seems to have brought the house on Isis Way creaking back into life. There is a small clutch of cars parked in the rutted driveway, ranging from an Elastoplast-coloured Ford with a dog blanket on the parcel shelf, to a gleaming black people-carrier with a discrete hire-company sticker above the number plate. There are lights gleaming from behind the thick veil of ivy over the windows, and raised voices from the door, which stands ajar.\nThe argument rises to a pitch as Robbie approaches, and the door is wrenched open by a red-faced, grey-haired, bull-built man in black before the bell has completed its first heavy swing. \"What? Don't you people realise this is a private house? No one here wants Sky television!\"\nIt's the same bellow that had answered the St Anthony's phone only a few minutes before, the same point-blank refusal to confirm or deny whether Mr Hathaway or Father Waite were at home, let along facilitate communication. The house is closed to all except those in immediate need of its shelter, and its doorkeeper is unmoveable. He can leave the bag, but he can't cross the threshold.\nRobbie fingers itch for his warrant card, his magic passport, but he already knows it is unlikely to work here. Instead he grabs one of his contact cards, scrawls \"Call me\" on the back and drops it into the bag.\nThen he turns away to seek Conn Patterson, and another way of getting a message to James.\n\"Inspector Lewis?\" Robbie turns back. The big man is still on the doorstep, looking at the card with a perplexed expression.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I think you'd better step inside for a moment.\u201d\n", "24": "\nChapter Text\n\nAdejole is waiting for Robbie in the little room where he last saw James, only a day before. He lays aside his book and rises, offering his hand. \u201cYou came! Thank the Lord; Father Waite has been asking for you all morning, but we didn\u2019t know how to contact you.\u201d\n\u201cInspector Hathaway has my number\u2026 \u201cAdejole frowns. \"But Mr Hathaway is not here.\u201d\"What!\"\"He went out, very early this morning - for cigarettes, he said. I lent him \u00a320, and a coat. He\u2019s not been back since.\"Robbie quells a prickle of fear. \"And you weren\u2019t concerned?\"\"He is our guest, not our prisoner. He doesn't need permission to take a walk.\"\u201cYou do realise that one of your former guests has been murdered, another is missing - and you are refusing to co-operate with a police investigation!\"\"I? I am co-operating with you right now, Inspector.\u201d\"My colleague DS Maitland called here last night \u2013 you \u2013 or Father Waite, or that belligerent chap downstairs, shut the door in her face.\u201d\u201cAh, that was Clive. He was only following the rules of the house. This is a haven for some troubled fellows. Some just need a bit of a helping hand \u2013 but others, well, they are tormented by the distance between their vocation and their weak nature. And all too often women are the source of that torment. We try to keep the house free of that provocation.\u201d\u201cProvocation! For pity's sake, man, what century are you living in! Women aren\u2019t a provocation. They are just people, like you and me, and locking yourself away from them won\u2019t prevent sin. I know only too well that people can find any excuse for evil inside their own heads, without outside help!\u201d\u201cYou are quite right. And now I have made you angry, which I regret. Please, Father Waite has not been well since last night, and between you and me, I don\u2019t believe he has very many days left amongst us. He very much wants to speak to you, and it may be that, as well as providing relief to his mind, he can provide just the information you seek. Come, through here\u2026 Ah \u2013 Father Waite has drifted off again. He does that from time to time \u2013 the drugs I believe. He will wake again soon, I am sure. You\u2019ll wait? I can fetch you some tea \u2013 or coffee? Very well. I will leave you alone together.\u201d And he closes the door behind him, leaving Robbie with the sleeping priest in his spare white washed bedroom.There is no chair, so Robbie sits on the window sill, in the warm spring sunshine. The sound of a lawn-mower drifts up from the world below. Down there, beyond the wilderness of St Anthony's garden and decayed wooden fence, Conn Patterson is mowing his own neat patch of green. A dozen boxes of bright pansies are laid out ready for planting in the freshly turned borders.Robbie can see the change in the old man for himself. Adejole might not know the significance of the pear-drop acetone scent on his breath, but Robbie recognises the evidence of the disease hollowing him out from within. Something has happened in the last 24 hours to loosen his grip on the world. His eyes twitch under the paper thin lids. What does he see, Robbie wonders, what dreams trouble a dying man? Memories of the past, or the hopes and fears he projects into the future.He turns his attention to the bedside cabinet, where, among the paraphernalia of sickness, sit a bible and two pictures, the only personal objects in the otherwise bare room.One, postcard-sized depicts a tonsured monk caressing a plump simpering baby, presumably the Christ Child, who for some reason is perched precariously on an open book. The other is more intriguing - a photograph, black and white, of a group of young men in long robes playing football on a dusty field under a fierce foreign sun. One, a dark, handsome bearded youngster has just scored, and raises his hands in triumph.\"Me. In a past life.\u201d Father Waite is watching him from the bed. \u201cHow fast it seems to have flown. You would think all those hours spent contemplating eternity might have prepared me for that, but no; it\u2019s still a surprise to find myself so old so soon. And that other chap - that is St Anthony, after whom this house is named.\u201d\"The one who had nightmares in the desert? My lad had the Dali poster on his wall for years, the one with the elephant.\"\"Wrong St Anthony; St Anthony Abbot was indeed harassed by erotic temptations, whereas St Anthony of Padua was troubled by a lost book. A student at the seminary where he taught ran away and took a valuable book with him. St Anthony prayed and the book was returned. History is silent on the subject of the young man's fate. It\u2019s a bad painting I\u2019m afraid.\"\"Well, I know nothing about art.\u201d\u201cI doubt that, somehow. Your eyes are everywhere, pinning down the meaning of every detail you see.\u201d\u201cFather Waite, I was told you might have something to tell me. Something about Mickey Dunn\u2019s death?\"\"Did you ever wonder to whom the priest makes his confession. I have heard details of so many transgressions - who do you suppose listens to mine?\"\"I don\u2019t know \u2013 perhaps you should tell me?\"But Waite seems to be wandering back into his past. \"When I was a much younger man, I served for a time in Liverpool. I had a very good friend, with a parish in Rochdale, and once every few months or so we would visit each other and get the business over with. I would hear his penance, he would hear mine, and then we could settle to a long, and happy evening together - good wine, good food, good conversation. His housekeeper was an excellent cook - but I could afford better wine!\"\"Sounds a bit cosy to me.\"\"Collusion. That's the word on your tongue, isn\u2019t it? Or cover up?\u201cWell, you have to admit I\u2019d have reason to be suspicious of an arrangement like that \u2013 it might just involve admitting to speeding, or uncharitable thoughts about a neighbour \u2013 \u201c\u201cOr something much, much worse.\u201d\u201cWe both know what that means. If your friend \u2013 or any of the other boys in your club \u2013 had confessed to worse, say rape or murder - what would you have done? You\u2019ve already told me you wouldn\u2019t turn them in. So \u2013 what would you do? Pat them on the head, say there, there, try not to do it again, now pass me the cork screw?\u201dThe priest snorts, \u201cAnd are you any better?\u201d and the sudden fire in his eyes recalls vividly the powerful presence he must have had before the cancer ate his strength.\u201cAre the police any less of a \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d? Any less prone to cover-up and collusion and scratching each other\u2019s back? On a lovely April Saturday, just like this one, I went to watch a football match, and watched, helpless, trapped, as 96 young men and women - some my own parishioners - had the life crushed out of them. And what were the police doing? What have they done for 25 years since? Lied. They smeared the reputations of the dead, and abused those who tried to save them. The mocked the pain of mothers waiting for children who would never come home. They shared brandy and cigars with newspaper editors to make sure that the truth would never be told, and the men responsible would never pay. Now that\u2019s what I call \u2018cosy\u2019!\u201dThe two men eye each other, like tom cats meeting in disputed territory, unwilling to attack, unable to withdraw. Robbie wonders if James is the mouse under Waite\u2019s paw. He chooses his words, carefully. \u201cI have been a policeman for over 30 years, and I have never lied to protect a colleague or frame a victim.\u201dWaite\u2019s eye\u2019s narrow. \u201cBut others have, and you have kept silent.\u201dIt\u2019s not a question, but Robbie finally nods in assent. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201dIt seems to satisfy Waite. \u201cWe are very alike, you and I. Sins of Omission.\u201dThat triggers a moment of recall; James, in darkness in the back of a car, yellow and blue light reflected in his eye. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cSin of Omission. \u2018Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.\u2019 \u2013 The Epistle of James the Just.\"One day, my friend sat at my fire side and told me something no penance and contrition and absolution could ever wipe away. Because he was not contrite. He didn't need my forgiveness, only my understanding.\"You would not think it a sin at all. Certainly not a crime; he had doubts - small ones, initially, but they had chipped away at the vast edifice of belief built since St Peter heard confessions in secret in the catacombs under Rome, until he brought it all crashing down on his head. He could no longer believe in the existence of the God he was bound to serve.\"I could not console him. His new convictions frightened me - so I asked him to leave. And he did. He left his comfortable home, his friends, his life's work, and he went out into a world that had no place for him.\"I expected to hear from him. I expected a letter, once he got a bit of perspective. We'd meet up, joke about his adventures out there together. I missed him, but I was too proud to reach out to him.\"Instead, three years later, I got a telephone call, informing me of his death, and asking me when I would collect his effect. \u00a0He died alone, in a horrible room in a seaside town, friendless, penniless. He had lain there undiscovered for days. No one had missed him - except me. My brilliant, gentle, loving friend...\" the old man's voice trails off into a choked sob, almost inaudible. Tears are leaking, slow and cold, through the maze of skin on his cheeks.\"That's why you set up this place.\"\"It's my penance. These men were called to save others, and then find no one to save them. I sold my wine, sold all I had to buy this house and open its doors to them all - whatever their doubts. Whatever their sins. Some never leave - and then there are those like our James, who have travelled so far, and with such grace...\" He grips Robbie's hand with surprising strength, pulling him in, towards his confidence, until they are eye to eye. \"James will need you. Be his friend. Do not abandon him.\"\"If you know anything, anything that can help, tell me now.\" The old man shakes his head, whether to indicate that he knows nothing, or can say nothing, Robbie cannot tell. \u201cIs he protecting someone here, someone who might have reason to fear exposure?\u201d Waite sighs. \u201cCome on \u2013 \u2018Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sinning\u2019. Just tell me what you can\u201d. The old man squeezes his eyes shut. His lips move. Robbie leans in to catch his words.\u201cMe. He is protecting me.\u201d Waite\u2019s clawed hand reaches out and grasps Robbie\u2019s wrist with a terrifying strength \"Please. I beg you. Do not let him fall into despair.\"\n", "25": "\nChapter Text\nThe paramedic has left his blues running, and the light, lazily flashing back from the windows and brass of St Anthony's has drawn half a dozen onlookers keen to enliven a slow Saturday with a little reflected drama, Conn Patterson, among them, secateurs in hand, grass stains on his knees and a look of deep concern on his face.Robbie crosses the driveway to intercept him on the pavement. \"I'm afraid Father Waite\u2019s taken a turn for the worst, they're just making him a bit more comfortable.\"\"I'm sorry to hear that, Mr Lewis - my Mo will be too. She's very much attached to him.\"The car keys jingle in Robbie's hand, his skin itches with the need to get moving, to find James. By Adejole's account it has been seven hours since he left St Anthony's in a borrowed coat after sitting up with Waite for most of the night.He could call uniform, ask them to keep an eye open, but on what grounds? He could get in the car and cruise the streets and paths, but in which direction?A cigarette run sounds like a reasonable enough pretext, but where has he been in the hours since. It is warm enough now, in the sunshine, but the night was bitter. Of course, there was nothing to stop him buying a pack then making a call with the change. But to whom?\"You look all in, Inspector!\"\"Aye...\"After all these years he is hazy about James's other friends and contacts. James has watched his faltering relationships for years, but James's always seem to leap out at him from nowhere. James has Lyn's number - but Robbie has not one emergency contact for James, bar a solicitor in Bicester, whose recorded message promises to return calls after the bank holiday weekend, and proffers a 0800 number for out-of-hours emergencies.\"Not getting enough sleep, by the look of you.\"There's the band, he knows, he's met them once - that double bass player, George? Didn't James joke about George buying two tickets on the bus to rehearsals, one for himself one for the instrument - but a bus from where?That gay lad, the film maker, is he still in Oxford? Robbie recalls something about him moving, to Cardiff perhaps, some job with the BBC. And just how close were they anyway? He has no idea.Nicotine. The most faithful relationship James has. The old flame he has never shaken off. He must know the location of every tab machine and vendor within a 5 minute walk of the nick. Always has. Robbie can't imagine that's changed in 10 years. He needs some local intelligence.\"Mr Patterson-\"\"Call me Conn, everyone does.\"\"Where would someone buy cigarettes round here?\"\"Oh, I wouldn't know - we don't smoke, see. I did, before we married, but my Mo wouldn't have it. There used to be a bit of a shop on the parade - newspapers, bread, milk, that sort of thing, but it closed down. Most people drive to the big Tesco's now.\"\"That's an all-nighter, isn't it?\"\"That's the one, opened a year or two back. It\u2019s on the wrong side of the ring road, mind. You'd have to take the car. Anyway it's not cigarettes you need, Inspector - What you want is a strong cup of tea.\"And from there, James could have gone - anywhere. Disappeared into the endless river of white and red lights streaming out of Oxford into the darkness.The answer is not out there \u2013 it\u2019s here, in this house, in whatever happened here two nights ago \u2013 or ten years before that. Where would someone who needed to think, to walk, to smoke, head from here, ten years ago?And here he is talking to the one person who was here, who might tell him what Waite cannot and James will not.\"Actually, I think I could do with a cuppa - if it's not too much trouble.\"He trails Conn into the cul-de-sac behind Isis Way, to a small bungalow, overshadowed by the ivy clad bulk of St Anthony's. In its own small way, it is just as dated, but with none of its neighbour\u2019s air of neglect. The windows are bright and clean, the paintwork fresh, the path and garden weed-free and blowing with tulips and winter pansies.There is a slender, almost girlish figure perched in the doorway, like a bird about to take wing.\"Now, just to warn you, Inspector, Conn says, just short of the gate, \u201cMy Maureen is a bit on the nervous side. Has been ever since\u2026well, anyway, go easy on the details. I'm not for the God thing, myself - but Mo, well, he was very kind to her. Here I am, my love, don\u2019t you fret!\"\u00a0\"I heard voices, Conn.\" Her voice is light, and Robbie notes how she holds her head, cocked, as if searching for the source of the sounds around her.\"No need to fret, old girl. This is a friend of Father Waite's, come round for a brew - Mr Lewis, my Maureen.\"\"Pleased to meet you, Mrs Patterson.\" Robbie holds out his hand. She turns towards him without releasing her grip of the door frame, as if she fears to be blown away. Her pale green eyes gaze out a face clean of make-up, freckled like a wren\u2019s egg, framed by faded red hair caught at the side by a clip. She ignores his hand, because, he realises, she cannot see it, or him, or the carefully planted flowers in her garden.\"How is the father?\u201d she asks, and, mindful of Conn's warning and her precarious perch, Robbie replies, \"Hanging on in there, Mrs Patterson, hanging on in.\"Which is true enough. Robbie can still feel the steel -spring grip of Waite's fingers on his wrist, and his peardrop-scented plea. He had lent in to that fierce gaze, to hear more, to know more, to reassure, to take the burden of the old man's fear and guilt.But the fingers had fallen away, and then the face, falling to one side like a candle left too close to a gas fire. No sound emerged from the sagging mouth except a gasping babble, and Robbie had called Adejole into the room even as the stroke started to burn the old man\u2019s certainties away.Even as Robbie thumbed the call through to dispatch, summoning paramedics to preserve Waite and his secrets, he had found himself watching the young priest, as focused on the next life as he himself was on saving this. Robbie has seen death in so many forms. He knows what Adejole was about, recognises the tiny silver cup, the little tin marked with a cross that would hold, as far as at least two of the men in that room were concerned, the living body of their God.\"Pink wafer, Mr Lewis?\" Conn Patterson is shaking a biscuit tin at him across the coffee table. The Pattersons have a liking for brightly coloured nursery food. Not just the violently tinted wafers, but a selection of iced blue and yellow party rings, and several jammy dodgers.Maureen reaches for the teapot. \"Best not, old girl,\" says Conn, tenderly incepting her hand, squeezing gently. \"It's a bit heavy. We don't get a lot of visitors, Mr Lewis, not since Father Waite took sick, last autumn. Sugar?\"Maureen subsides into her chair, apparently happy to let her husband fuss, her smile warm, but distant, as if she is listening to some secret music inaudible to the rest of them. She seems half the age of Conn, but only, Robbie realises, because she has the smooth ageless look of a life suspended, as if at some point her world ceased to move forward with the rest of them. She probably doesn't get out of this room very much - there is no car in the drive way, no oil or tyre marks on the smooth concrete, just Conn's bicycle, leaning against the wall and freshly polished.But then, he reflects, as he takes his cup and waves away the sugar bowl, there might be worse places to be trapped. It's a lovely room, chairs and tables placed just so, everything with a place, a little old fashioned, even the CD player now looking like something from a bygone era. Everything a little worn, but spanking sparkling clean. Maureen sits like a queen, surrounded by warmth and light, despite the looming shadow of St Anthony's extension, which seems to butt almost to the shared fence.\"Is that the annex then?\" he asks.\"Jerry-built, I'm afraid, just after the war. Damp and insanitary, not safe at all. I offered to help rewire it, a few years back, but they never raised the funds.\"I was an electrical engineer, see, before I took early retirement, at Castle Bromwich, that's the old Jaguar line, but I did my apprenticeship at Cowley, and I always liked Oxford. Civilised place, a good town to raise kids, grow some flowers and be on friendly terms with the neighbours.\"That's what's missing. Children. Robbie hadn't put his finger on it until that moment. There aren't that many pictures in the room, naturally enough in the circumstances, and only one of a child, a little boy with Maureen's freckles and smile, half shy, half mischievous, perched on a chopper bike. No school photos, no graduation, no wedding photographs, or snaps of grandchildren.\"You seem to be on good terms with your neighbours across the way.\u201d The tea is hot and strong and good. Robbie realises how thirsty he had become.\"Well. that's down to Father Waite. He's a gentleman. You can tell he was born in a better class than most.\u201d Conn Patterson loads sugar into his own cup as he speaks. \u201cI'm not saying the Sisters were bad neighbours, and I helped them a bit about the place - but the girls they took in, they were a handful. Hardened little tarts, some of them, they used to slommuck around, hanging out of the windows, all hours, calling out all kinds of filth. Words I\u2019d never even heard on the factory floor! It was very upsetting to Mo.\"\"It didn't really bother me, love. They were just lassies, having a bit a cant.\"\"Well, when Father Waite bought the place, he came round almost at once to introduce himself, set our minds at rest - see, there was talk back then of the council buying the place from the nuns, and turning it into a bail hostel of all things\"\"When was that again?\" Robbie asks. \"That he bought the house?\"\"Oh, well - let\u2019s see, we moved here in '94, and the sisters moved out in '98. Father Waite paid for the new fence, and had some of the windows on the extension bricked up, to give us a bit more privacy.\"\"Are you staying at St Anthony's, Mr Lewis?\"Robbie glances at Conn before answering. \"No, Mrs Patterson - I'm with the police.\"\"Mr Lewis is a detective, old girl.\"\"Are you investigating something?\"\"Now, Mo, don't you go thinking police work's like it is on the telly. It\u2019s not like that Midsommer Murders, is it Mr Lewis, eh?\"\"Call me Robbie.\"\"It\u2019s not all murders and bodies in the library, like that John Nettles has to worry about. I don't suppose the Inspector here sees more than one body a year, if that!\"\"Your husband\u2019s right, Mrs Patterson, you\u2019ve nothing to worry about - I'm just looking into an accident a few night\u2019s back.\u201d\"One of the fathers?\"\u00a0\u201cNot really \u2013 someone who used to live there, a while back. You might remember him. Michael Dunn - some people called him Mickey?\u201d\"Mo's never set foot in the place, have you girl? And, like I said yesterday, I can't recall this Dunn at all.\"\"Yes you do, Conn! The young fellow with the camera.\"\u201cWhat \u2013 him? I caught taking pictures of my Mo over the fence, without so much by your leave. Was that Dunn? He had a nerve!\u201d\"He was just lonely, Conn. He said the garden looked like heaven. I think he just wanted a little bit of what he missed. Go on, show him the pictures.\"\"Pictures? I don\u2019t recall\u2026\"\"Go on. They\u2019re in my old sewing box, in the cabinet.\"Conn looks stumped. \u201cI\u2019d no idea you\u2019d kept them.\u201dRobbie dusts the crumbs from his hands, \u201cI'd love to have a peek - oh, thank you, Mrs Patterson, don't mind if I do.\" He takes another wafer and balances it on his saucer, as Conn rummages through the glass fronted cabinet with pursed lips, and returns with an old fashioned basket, full of rusted pins, odd buttons, and a half-darned sock, a rusted needle still wedged in the wool. There are several photographs, wedged in the side, one or two snatched as Conn suggested from the window high above the garden, a handful taken on the lawn itself, on a bright day with the cherry in blossom.\"I asked him to print them out for me,\" says Maureen, glowing with pride at being the star of photographs she will never see.And there she is, in black and white, a picture of contentment, sitting among the flowers, smiling shyly, mischievously. And there, at her feet sprawled out on the grass, is James, absurdly young, gazing up through the camera at the man who would try to blackmail him ten years later.\"You must have been out, Conn, the day them came round to apologise. Michael and his friend. Oh, now he had a lovely voice. Smoked like a chimney. Nerves, I expect. They are all nervous when they arrive, Father Waite's boys. I made them orange squash.\"\"Could I borrow this?\" Robbie asks, aware of a glow in his face, as if this weren't a perfectly routine request. \"I'll make sure you get it back.\"\"Did you say Mickey'd been in an accident?\"\"Two nights back.\"\"That would be the night the lights went out next door.\"\"Aye, that's the one. We think maybe Mr Dunn was heading towards St Anthony's. What time did the power go off?\u201d\"About ten thirty - Conn got a phone call.\"\"No, no Mo - it was much later than that - past eleven, it was Mr Lewis. Mo drifts off a bit in the evenings, don't you old girl? After you have your hot milk. It was past eleven when they rang.\"\"Who made the call?\"\u00a0\"That African chap, I suppose. But you could see it from here - the whole house in darkness. I made sure Mo was safely tucked up, then went over to see what I could do to help. There must have been about seven or eight of them, sitting in the dark.\u201d\"So, Mickey Dunn could have been there - at the vigil?\"\"Well, now you mention it, yes. I didn\u2019t want to disturb them, so I suppose he might have been - sandy haired chap, wasn't he, on the short side? Yes- he could have been there.\"\"What about Mr Hathaway?\"\"Ha, no. Now that I'd know for certain. Great tall lanky chap like him. Stand out. No. I didn't see Mr Hathaway. I just did what I could which was little enough, then went home.\"\"He was chilled to the bone when he came back, Mr Lewis. Feet like ice.\"Conn blushes and takes Maureen's hand in his own, in a way that Robbie finds oddly touching. \u201cNow, now, old girl. The Inspector doesn't need to know that sort of thing!\"Robbie dunks his wafer in the last few inches of tea, and indulges in the sharp nostalgia in the contrast of hot sweet pulp and crisp shards.Isn't this the life he\u2019s always wanted? A life of small, sweet comforts, clean and content, decline and darkness warded off with the practical magic of paint and polish and winter pansies. He can imagine Val, curled in a chair in a pool of spring sunshine, her auburn head bent over a book, while he forks up the spuds for their lunch. Or Laura. Perhaps this is what life with Laura will be like, a decade from now. Except, he realises, it would be Laura in the garden. If he's honest he wouldn't know which end of a potato plant to put in the soil.The air suddenly feels close, the room over warm. He needs fresh air. He needs to move, to find James. He drains the last chewy dregs of tea. \"I'd best be on my way - thanks for the brew. Could I just use your, um -? \"\"Bathroom? Of course, second on the left.\"The bathroom is as neat and safe and clean as the rest of the little house. Two glasses, two toothbrushes. No rug, obviously, nothing to tangle a blind woman's feet, just a nonslip floor. Shelves clear of clutter, safety lock on the cabinet, no lock on the door. A wooden chair by the bath, and one of those rubber hoses, hung over the bath taps, the ones folk washed their hair with before they had showers. Before they had baths even, as Robbie remembers from his Nana Robb's house in Seghill.No mirror. Of course. At least this time he doesn't have to watch himself snooping into other people's lives, other people's tragedies. Has a cop ever asked to use a civilian\u2019s bathroom in complete innocence? He wonders if his state licensed curiosity will simply wither away after retirement, and he will be able to relieve himself without checking that his hosts aren\u2019t concealing a murder weapon among the clean towels.He shakes himself dry, flushes, washes his hands and leaves.Conn is hovering in the hallway, to usher him out of the front door, out of Maureen's hearing.\"Thank you for being discrete, Inspector. She's better than she was, but she has nightmares... well, it was worse when we could hear the babies, in the annex. The crying would wake her and she'd go looking for our own little lad, wandering about in the dark.\"\"What happened?\"\"Drunk driver. Christmas, see. Mo was driving Peter to see his Gran.\"\"I'm sorry.\"\"He was a grand lad. Lovely. Losing him \u2013 I had to be strong for both of us. For a while I thought I'd lost them both \u2013 but it was Father Waite who brought my Mo back to me. We\u2019ve been happy ever since, just the two of us.\"\"She's a beautiful woman, Conn.\"\"You know, Inspector, I've been thinking, about the cigarettes. Was it Dunn you were thinking of? It\u2019s just, there was a place...\"\"Yes - \"\"Well, going back a bit, some of the residents were members of a club, just a few streets over, in Coal Hill Cut...\"\"What, the Bricklayers?\"\"You know it then?\"\"Aye, well I'm a cop, I'm supposed to know stuff like that.\"\"Ah, well, I suppose you would know it. It had a certain reputation, back in the day. Still, live and let live, I say. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the place was open all hours, if you get my meaning. Still is, as far as I know. You could do worse than try there.\"\n", "26": "\nChapter Text\nNavigators\u2019 Cut runs parallel to the canal, one of those streets found in every city where the light seems to have wandered in at some point in the 1950s and never found its way out again. A dingy street of terraced brick cottages which seem to resist gentrification, a shuttered scrap yard and a long-closed corner shop with DAIRY painted across the window in faded blue letters.The Bricklayers' Arms, a low pebble-dashed building with opaque wired glass in the windows, was indeed once well known to the police, but not perhaps for the reason Conn might believe.In 1979 the Brickies was what passed, on certain nights, for one of Oxford\u2019s gay bars.\u00a0 Not the Oxford of gowns and port and braying students in wingtip collars, but the city of car workers and quarry men, car dealers and builders.It had been run back then by Bernie, thickset and straight as a die, and his venomous wife Lil, who hated all men only slightly less than she loathed all women.As a result the only other women you ever saw in the Brickies were the strippers who worked five to nine, for the shift workers, and the drag acts who lip-synced to Shirley Bassey and kept the tills ringing from ten to midnight and beyond.That combination, marinated in beer, smoke and testosterone, had become a staging post for the boys of Cowley nick, venue for male-bonding, late-night lock-ins and stag parties, where, cops rubbed sheepskin clad shoulders with the very men they kicked senseless for cottaging in Oxford's public lavatories.Robbie had been bemused to see the response of his peers to the club\u2019s entertainment. Drag queens were greeted with enthusiasm and applause, drunken kisses were blown, feather boas appropriated, in a strident parody of courtship.Yet in the presence of the strippers they could only watch in slack-jawed silence, glazed eyes trained on the last strip of sequined nylon, anticipating the awe-filled moment of revelation.\"Good god, man,\" he longed to say, \"Yes, it's a fanny. What else did you think she might have in there - a koala?\"But he never did. He just supped his beer, and smiled and nodded at bellowed conversations he could barely hear, and felt nothing but a huge relief on the night Val put her foot down and the baby in his arms and announced that he was staying in and she was to evening class, and he realised he need never set foot in the god-awful place again.And now he's back, flashing his warrant card at the door, looking for a long blonde needle in a city sized haystack. A needle who in all probability is already back at St Anthony's, and sitting down to whatever it is that clerical types have for lunch.With a sudden qualm he recalls the bag, left with his note. Call me.. It's all \u00a0wrong. It gives too much away. James will open that bag and he'll know. He'll know I looked - he'll know I noticed.It's quiet, just a couple of locals killing time with a beer. Nothing much has changed \u2013 same, dank patterned carpet, scarred wooden stage, porridge coloured walls, the same dark maze of cubicles and banquettes. No smoke, of course, but still resolutely brown as if lacquered in tar.And who would have thought it, that must be Lil herself, sipping gin on a stool beside the bar, 80 if she's a day, mouth a painted cat's arse of disapproval, half the size she\u2019d been, and she'd barely reached his shoulder then. \u00a0But it's not Bernie who pulls him a pint of over-chilled Tetley's.There's a small knot of punters in the far corner, gathered around a table. Robbie moves towards them. The tension holding their attention breaks, they cheer and shift, and, as they do, Robbie sees him.James, hunched over playing chess against an old man in a cable-knit cardigan.He's focused on the board, and apparently doesn't see Robbie approach. His eyes are sunken - he hasn't slept in what, two nights now? Does he fear bad dreams too?He's the stuff of respectable citizens' nightmares himself, unshaven, in ill-fitting clothes, one eye blackened, lip swollen. It seems to have affected his game - he looks distracted, puzzled, his hand hovers over the pieces, chooses one, replaces it unplayed.\u00a0 The spectators murmur suggestions, commiserations, \"Never mind, lad,\" and \"Got you a bit bottled up there, hasn't he,\" and \"No shame in it, you tried your best.\"Then James drops the act, moves his queen, takes a knight and says, quietly \"Mate in four.\u201d The spectators groan and clap, and start to pay up on the wagers they made.\"How did you find me,\" James asks, without looking up.\"You might not have noticed, but I am a bit of a detective,\" he says. \u201cI can still manage a bit of house-to- house without you holding my hand.\"The bloke in the cardigan folds up his board and slides out of the banquette to let Robbie in. \u00a0Bushmills, was it?\" he asks, and James nods. His companions drift off towards the bar with him, and Robbie and James are alone.\"You don't usually drink whiskey?\"\"I do when I'm among friends. The beer in here is vile.\"\"Always was.\"James looks at him then, his pupils dark and blown. The defeated chess player returns with a double, and places it on the table in between them. \"Well played!\" He lingers for a moment, waiting for a reply, but neither man looks at him, so he sighs and moves away, the board and box still tucked under his arm.James downs the glass in one. There's a small collection of tumblers on the table, a crumpled pack of Marlborough Lights and a neat stack of fifty p coins.\"Are you hustling, Inspector Hathaway?\u201d\"No law against it, Inspector Lewis. Gambling Act 2005 Schedule 12: Sections 279 & 280: Exempt gaming for small stakes on licensed premises.\" James smiles into his empty glass. \"Chess paid for most of my student vices.\" His fingers stray to the crumpled cigarette pack, turning it over and over. Robbie's heart aches at the familiar gesture; James clutching at a talisman of adult life that only traps him forever as the kid behind the bike shed, trying to look like a man..\"James, we need to talk.\"James crushes the cardboard. \"In that case -\u201d his eyes flick over the pile of change, calculating. \"- can you lend me \u00a31.25? I've a feeling I'm going to need a full pack.\"Robbie opens his wallet and pulls out a twenty. \"On me.\"\"God. It must be bad if you're offering to sub my coffin nails.\"\n", "27": "\nChapter Text\nThere's a chill little breeze playing with the litter at their feet, but Robbie is sure that\u2019s not the reason James's hands are shaking as he tries, and fails, to light up.\"I was at St Anthony's.\"James flicks a spent match away. \"And?\"\"Your friend, Waite; doesn't look as if he has much longer.\"\"Well, obviously.\" James\u2019s calm is belied by the rattle of the box in his hand. Another match gutters and dies in his fingers. He throws it down, rubs his face, scratches at the pale half-beard starting to form on his chin.\"Christ, James, what are you doing to yourself? You look bloody terrible.\"\"So sorry to disappoint you, sir.\"Robbie aches to snatch the box from him, do the thing properly. Cup the flame against the wind, draw James down into his hands to take it, hear paper and leaf hiss into fire... \"Away, man, it's nothing a wash and good kip won't fix.James laughs. \"No hot water. No, maybe you're right. A cold shower should fix everything, right?\u201d Third attempt successful, James draws deeply, squeezing his eyes shut \u201cBracing.\"\"I've got hot water. And a bed. Look, if it\u2019s space you want, I can move out for a bit, move in with Laura. Here - take the keys.\" James barely glances at the keys in Robbie's hand, then stares back at the gutter at his feet. \"James \u2013 I know how tough this must be. I understand.\u201d\"With all due respect, you don't. You're not the one with SOCO scraping DNA off the Kleenex in your bin.\u201d\"I know. James, just look at me. I'm not here on the job\u2026\u201d\"Really? How nice for you. How do you get to switch it off?\"\nBut I don't, do I - and you know it. I'm standing here, looking at you, trying to work out how a man left your flat, full of your wine and full of your coffee and, apparently, full of your sleeping pills, and is found hours later stone dead, and wrapped in a shower curtain. \n\"James, man, if you won't talk to me, how can I help you?\"\u201cYou can't help. This is something you can't fix. You, of all people. No. Don't touch me.\" James almost stumbles into the road in his anxiety to back away. \u201cYou\u2019ll never understand what it\u2019s been like - in here, all these years.\u201d He taps his temples furiously, as if to force the thoughts and words safely back into his skull, back into the darkness. \"In this bloody stupid head of mine, second guessing every impulse, every thought, every gesture, hating what you want, loathing yourself for wanting it, stepping so carefully in case you let something slip, something get away from you.\"\"Christ, you\u2019re not making sense. This is what it's all about? You being gay? So what? You think after all this time that bothers me? You're not the first copper with a secret, and you won't be the last, not by a long chalk. It doesn't make you special, or worse or better than anyone else.\"\"You have no idea. Go on - tell me how easy my life is, I dare you. What could possibly go wrong. I mean, it\u2019s all legal now, all respectable, isn\u2019t it? I could even invite the Chief Super to my wedding. Totally wipes out 30 years of crouching in the dark, begging God, someone, anyone to take it away, all of it, before it slips out, and someone gets hurt.\"It must all seem so strange to you.\u00a0 How could you understand?\u00a0 Everything you've ever wanted lines up so perfectly with what the world expects. You don\u2019t even have to pretend to be happy.\u00a0 Bet you got gold stars at school for colouring inside the lines.\u00a0 Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy loses girl...\u201cRobbie's face flares with a sudden incandescent heat, at a blow which stings all the more for its complete surprise.\u00a0 \u00a0James knows at once what he has done.\u00a0 He\u2019s pale with horror, \"Shit, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dJames folds, the heels of his hands pressed into his eyes, to block out the world.\"So.\u00a0 Tell me what you meant.\u201d\u00a0A woman walking her dog towards the canal glances across at them - an old man in a suit and tie scrapping in the street with a lad half his age in sagging sportswear and bruises - draws her own conclusions and quickens her step.\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d James\u2019s hands fall away; his eyes are huge, and dark, and spilling with cold tears.\u00a0 \u00a0He looks as exhausted as Robbie now feels. \u201cAt least now you know just how disgusting really I am.\u201dRobbie wants to feel rage, or disgust, but all that fills his mouth is a kind of acid misery. \"What do you want from me?\"\"Nothing. Please.\u00a0 Go home. There is nothing you can do now that won't make this worse.\" He turns to walk away, head down, hands thrust deep into coat pockets.\"You're right.\" Robbie calls after him. \"I don't understand.\"James turns back, in the middle of the road, in a kind of squared off, miserable triumph to accept Robbie's scorn. But all Robbie can see is grief. For Dunn? For Waite? For some other unknown, unnamed love? He has no idea.\"Colouring inside the lines? Good god, man - I'm not the one around here drawing up lines that can't be crossed. That's all I hear these days, \u2018what\u2019s your type?\u2019 Dividing us up.\u00a0 Men, women, gay, straight, young, old, hair colour, eye colour, weight; like a menu in a coffee shop, or, or that god-forsaken leisure park \u2013 all looks like freedom and choice, but it's empty, everyone looking at the fancy packet, never what\u2019s inside.\"The phone in his breast pocket is throbbing, but Robbie is barely aware of it over the empty pounding of his heart.\"But then, what would I know, eh? Dull, boring old Robert Lewis, slept with just one person his whole life. But that's the point. I fell in love with a person. Not a girl. Not a number, not a type, not a selection of chromosomes, the right sort of plumbing. A person. She was whole, and unique, and I loved every bit of her, whatever and whoever she was.\u201dJames is still staring at him, stock still in the unlovely, lonely street, his face rigid and unreadable, eyes dark and intent. His mouth opens. \"Are you going to answer that?\"\"What - ?\"\"Your phone. That's a Shout.\"Robbie blinks. The insistent ringtone throbbing against his ribs finally registers, the programmed tone reserved for Command and Despatch. For call-outs.\u00a0\"Wait there,\" he calls as he fumbles in his jacket, but too late. James is already walking away, away from the canal, away from the Bricklayers, away from him.\"Inspector?\", De Souza's voice, tight and urgent, \"I'm at Dunn's place. Get here, fast. Blues and twos.\" James's long legs have already carried him past the scrap yard. \"Debbie's gone out on the ledge, and refuses to talk to anyone but you.\u201d\n", "28": "\nChapter Text\n\"She seemed okay. Exhausted herself crying last night, but calm enough. Just said she wanted a bath. I thought it was a good sign.\u201d Sergeant De Souza is trying very hard not to sound defensive.\nRobbie can hear water running in the bathroom at the top of the stairs of the tiny house.\n\"Next thing I know, she's throwing stuff, breaking glass, screaming, and she won't come out. Won't talk to me or McGuire here. Just kept asking for you.\"\nThe small, bare, pebble-dashed house is uncomfortably full, even with the door wide open. Robbie, De Souza, two paramedics with bulky packs and radios crackling, McGuire and Williams from Family Liaison team and DCI Siobhan Maitland, struggling to speak into her phone over the babble of voices and static.\n\"When you called me, you said she was suicidal?\"\n\"She said she wanted it to stop.\"\nUpstairs Debbie Dunn wails.\nRobbie knows that sound, deep and animal and ripped out of the strongest muscles in the human body. Does Debbie understand what is happening to her, he wonders, or has she simply added this latest torment to the storm of grief and misery which has descended on her in the last 24 hours?\n\u201cJust \u2018it\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cEverything.\u201d\n\"What's she got in there? Pills, razors? Did you check?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I bloody checked.\u201d\n\"We both did, sir.\" That's McGuire. As hard-headed as she is pretty. \"Standard search. The bathroom was clean - the whole house.\"\nAnother scream and the sound of falling, shattering glass.\n\"Well, it sounds as if she's found an alternative to razors. Just break the bloody door down and get her out of there, man!\nThe paramedic shakes his head. \"She's sat right against the glass panel, mate. Can't guarantee she won't get hurt if we go in. If you could just get her to shift up a bit, away from the door\u2026\"\nSiobhan Maitland snaps her phone off and turns to Robbie for the first time. \"Psychologist is still forty-five minutes away. She won't respond to any of us, she asked for you. Can you keep her talking?\"\n\"I can try.\" At least this one can't run away from him.\n\u201cSir.\" Frankie De Souza, pulling him to one side. \"The house was easy to search. Too easy - not just the bathroom. There was nothing here. I mean, stripped. No food, not even milk. Williams had to charge the electric meter before we could even make a brew. Looks like stuff's been sold. Space on the shelves, that sort of thing. And this - \" She thrusts a letter at him.\nDistress leaps out from the sea of boilerplate text: Arrears. Eviction. Officer of the Court. Removal of goods. So much for Mickey Dunn\u2019s business plans.\nThe bathroom is at the far end of a narrow landing.\n\u201cMrs Dunn?\u201d He can see her outlined against the frosted glass, curled up into a knot of misery. \u201cDebbie?\" He crouches low, so he need not raise his voice. \"It's me. Inspector Lewis. Remember? Robbie. You wanted to tell me something.\"\nHe can feel rather than hear the sobbing on the other side of the cracked glass. She's panting. Like a cat, crawling into a cupboard to give birth alone. He has no idea what he will say or do, but then he never does.\n\"You all right, lass? You've got everyone here worried about you.\"\n\"Make them go away.\u201d\n\"It's just me, Debbie.\" There\u2019s a creak on the staircase behind him. Irritated, he turns to wave the paramedic back down and out of sight.\nThe girl sobs again, then hisses, and curls even further around her swollen belly. \u201cDad. I want my Dad.\"\nRobbie can almost hear the fat tears dropping from the girl's chin as her shoulders convulse.\nHe\u2019d listened only minutes earlier to Maitland update; Debbie\u2019s parents still untraced, the electoral roll leading Uniform to a flat a mile away, locked and dark. Calls going straight to an old-style answering machine, and a neighbour who only said that the couple were respectable; kept themselves to themselves and that maybe he\u2019d heard they had a caravan, somewhere in Wales. Or Bournemouth. Or Cromer.\n\"Okay, Debbie. You just hang on there. You're going to be okay.\"\n\"You can't know that,\" she wails.\n\"I do, though - 'cos I'm a dad, remember? We\u2019ve seen it all - we know when thing are going work out in the end.\u201d\n\"My Dad never wants to see me again. He told me.\"\n\"Oh Pet. Dads say all sorts of stupid stuff. All the time.\u201d He leans in as close as he dares to the cracked pane. \u201cI've said stuff when I'm angry or upset or tired, and wished it was right back in me big mouth as soon as it\u2019s out.\"\nThere's an odd smell in the air leaking under the door. Chemical. Metallic. Oily. Familiar, half forgotten, that hits you in the back of the throat and stays there for hours afterwards.\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s nothing we can't sort out, Debbie. You and me. Why don\u2019t you let me in, and tell me all about it.\"\n\"No! No! No!\" She scrambles back against the door frame, panting hard. \"No one can see. No one.\"\n\"Shhh, Pet, shhh, it's okay. There\u2019s no one here but me, honest, and I\u2019ve seen all sorts. Look \u2013 why don\u2019t you unbolt the door, and let me in - I'll lock the door again right behind me. Just you and me. I promise.\u201d\nThe cracked glass in the door creaks alarmingly. \"Good girl. Just reach up and slide the bolt. Can you do that?\u201d He can hear the girl panting, can see her hand outlined against the glass, reaching, scrabbling at the lock. \u201cCareful now - that\u2019s it. Now shuffle back.\u201d\nOver his shoulder he can see Siobhan Maitland, standing in the crook of the staircase, waiting, watching. She nods, once, and he steps over Debbie Dunn\u2019s drawn up legs to squeeze through the gap and slips the bolt back into place.\nEven in the first few seconds, and in the half-light cast through the torn blind, Robbie can see the bathroom is a wreck.\nHis shoes crunch on broken glass, the bath panel is in splinters, the floor is awash with debris, torn paper and splintered plastic, while water spills from the edge of a the tub onto jumble of bottles, plastic trays and drifts of sodden paper, torn from their hiding place underneath.\nIt's this, the sheets of paper afloat and underfoot, that brings the strange chemical scent sharply into focus in Robbie\u2019s memory. It is the smell of his youth, of the days and night working Vice, of basement darkrooms where the pornographers of Newcastle printed smut in a distant pre-digital past.\nHe feels something underfoot, lifts his sole, and James Hathaway, painted in light and shadow, looks back at him.\n\"That's Jamie,\u201d Debbie sprawls against the door frame in her bathrobe, bare legs drawn up under her, dank, panting. \u201cI told you about him. I knew Mickey was hiding something up here, under the bath, in here night after night when he thought I was sleeping.\u201d\nRobbie crouches beside her, relieved to see that she seems unharmed. \u201cHe went on and on about him \u2013 Jamie, his fancy clothes, his fancy flat, job and what a hypocrite he was. When I asked him what that meant, he shouted at me.\u201d She screws up her face in misery, \u201cIt\u2019s all just shouting. We had no money, and the electric went out, and he\u2019d taken the money from my purse to buy stuff. I said terrible things to him, horrible things, and all he said was I should have more faith, he\u2019d make it all right again\u2026\u201d\n\"Come on, lass.\" He gently strokes a damp rat-tail of hair from her swollen face.\n\u201c\u2026he just left, and it\u2019s my fault. If I\u2019d had faith he\u2019d still be here\u2026\u201d her voice rising in a wail of pain and panic \u201c\u2026 and now I\u2019m dying too!\u201d\n\"Debbie. Listen to me. You\u2019re not dying. It\u2019s just your baby, that's all.\"\n\"Make it stop,\" she pants.\n\u201cShhh - It'll pass.\" He squeezes her hand. \"It always does. Now, let's get you a bit more comfortable, eh?\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t come now. Mickey was supposed to be here, to look after us\u201d\n\u201cCome on \u2013 up you get,\" With some difficulty he helps the girl to her feet, and supports her as he snags a towel from the rail to fold under her as he eases her down onto the toilet seat. \u201cNothing to worry about. I\u2019ve seen babies arrive before now.\u201d\nHis count is three; two of his own, Val clinging to his hand and swearing like a docker, and one in a snowbound layby between Blaydon and Prudhoe, when he was six weeks into uniform and as green as a cabbage. Blue light flashing over rutted snow and Christmas songs on the radio. Somewhere in Blaydon today there is a thirty-five year old woman called Carol Louisa Bobbie Robson - and he ever meets her he will owe her a heartfelt apology for his part in her name.\nNow he desperately hopes he won\u2019t have to deliver Debbie\u2019s child here in this narrow space between bath and door, littered with the wreckage of Mickey Dunn's plans and dreams.\nHe hitches up his trousers and crouches down beside the girl.\n\"Your lovely suit...\" she protests, and to be honest he dreads to think what Mr Khan will say when he brings these in next week.\n\"Don\u2019t you worry about that, lass. You just sit here a moment, nice and quiet.\" He slides an arm around her, and she settles a little closer to him, hot with an excess of life. \"You gave poor Frankie a real fright just now.\"\nShe pushes the damp wad of paper into his hand. The emulsion is lifting in mottled patches, but Robbie can see past them, as if through pond ice, to an unbearably familiar profile.\n\"What was Mickey doing, hiding all this away, when I needed him? All I wanted was to make him happy, and I never could.\u201d\nHappy, thinks Robbie, and looks at the sun-gleaming head bowed over his guitar, hands caressing neck and strings, lips curved in a rare and precious smile. Just a boy, alone on a crumpled sheet. Happy.\n\u201cI loved him \u2013 why couldn\u2019t I understand what he needed.\u201d\n\u201cOh, lass. I\u2019ve been around years, and I still don\u2019t really understand what makes folk tick. You can spend years with a person, day in, day out, and they'll still surprise you. One day, they do or say something, out of the blue, and it\u2019s like you're staring at a stranger.\u201d He glances again at the smiling stranger in the photograph. A mouth he knows so well, curved in a smile he has never seen before.\n\u201cHow can you ever trust anyone, if you can never be sure you know them?\u201d\n\u201cYou trust the things you know about them. \u201c Robbie holds her just a little closer. \u201cLike, I never got to meet your Mickey, but I know something really important about him.\u201d\nDebbie stares at him with wide damp eyes.\n\u201cLast thing Mickey did, the very last, was try to find the money you needed, for you and the baby. Whatever else happened, however wrong it went, what he wanted was for both of you to be safe and warm and looked after.\n\"You know the biggest surprise of them all? Most folk are just deep down, kind. \u201c He remembers the man in the photograph in his hand, turning up unbidden every December 19th, accompanying him to the quiet acre of earth and grass and engraved granite slabs where he had buried his own hopes for the future, and just standing, wordless, waiting, watching. Fiercely, apologetically gentle.\n\"Downstairs, right now, there are people who\u2019ve not met you, but all they want is to look after you, keep you safe. I know it\u2019s not easy, and you\u2019ll hate them for it, but you have to be brave enough to do what Mickey wanted, and let them care for you. Can you do that?\u201d\nThe silence stretches out around them, two strangers sharing a fleeting eddy in the great rivers pulling their lives on and out of shape. Then she squeezes his hand back, nods, and Robbie opens the door to let the rivers carry them apart again.\nRobbie holds Debbie Dunn\u2019s clammy twisting fingers as she answers the paramedics\u2019 questions, as she is strapped into evacuation chair, as she if lifted into the waiting ambulance.\nBut as the doors close he steps back, and feels once again the quiet internal uncoupling of responsibility which has kept him whole and sane for the past forty years, as he turns his full attention to the bundle of sticky paper clutched in his left hand throughout.\nFive photographs. Portrait of a Young Man. Alone, on a crumpled sheet on a day of bright sun that set ten years ago. Naked. James Hathaway. Familiar in every regard, but utterly unknown to him, revealed in landscapes of shadow and skin, like an unexplored country glimpsed from the window of an aeroplane.\nUntil a few hours ago Robbie would have sworn he knew this man. Now he realises he knows nothing, and must start again.\nLook at the evidence. \u201cHe watches well who notes well what he sees.\u201d Look. \nThe stranger in his hand is young - younger than his 25 years, as if the estrangement from God had been a sort of rebirth, as if it had freed him to sit like this, at home in his skin for the first time since childhood. What did it mean, this offering of skin and flesh in place of bread and wine?\nAnd if James - the James he thought he knew - has rebuttoned and withdrawn from the light since, why?\nPerhaps, he realised, the ultimate mystery of James Hathaway was not what he was repressing under those layers of cotton, silk and wool \u2013 who doesn\u2019t have secrets and fears they bury from the sunlight \u2013 but rather, what James would be if the weight of that armour were ever to be removed.\nBecause this is what is shocking to him. Not the flesh but the smile.\nHe has never seen James this happy before.\nHe is beginning to understand why these images devastated Debbie. Each frames her husband's discontent and desire.\nNot for the segment of tender flesh at the juncture of arm and torso, the indented chest, sharply jutting hip, or for the shadowed cock, curled heavy against the thigh.\nRobbie knows pornography \u2013 it was his business once. Over the years he\u2019s seen every variety of desire, human and inhuman, framed in paper and film, And for all their intimacy and honesty, these five portraits are as cool and chaste any of the marble limbs and torsos he and Laura wandered among last week in the cloisters of Florence.\nIt\u2019s not the body the photographer covets. It\u2019s joy. James\u2019s joy, whatever, whoever its source, is self-contained, escaping from him like the light of a shaded lamp.\nI think he just wanted a little bit of what he missed, Maureen had said.\nMickey Dunn, looking through a lens over a garden fence, where the grass is always greener \u2026\nTormented not by Lust, but Envy.\nAnd that leaves Robbie with another problem. Because, just as there is no sex in theses shots, there is no motive for blackmail. No motive for murder.\nHe has to trust the fragile scraps to Siobhan Maitland, and hope that she can see them, and understand them, as he does.\n\u00a0\n\n \n", "29": "\nChapter Text\nIn the end, it's not Maitland Robbie has to convince, but someone closer and dearer to him \u2013 and much, much more terrifying.\nThe Blackbird Leys may not be the hellish sinkhole it was paintedin the headlines of the \u201880s and \u201890s, but it is still not an overly gentle or genteel place. Men in football colours, women wrapped in dressing gowns, smoke and hooped jewellery, children circling on bicycles, holding mobile phones aloft to broadcast the unfolding drama. Time was, Robbie recalls, the papers would pick up the scent of a story on semi-legal radio scanners. Now all they have to do is flip through twitter between lattes to see the news unfold in real time.\nHe recognises many among these loudly curious neighbours. They havefaces and names he has known from their childhoods, or the infancy of parents and grandparents. Short generations of families with a long and complicated relationship with the law. Victims, offenders, informers, with the turn of each year.\nThey are not easily impressed or intimidated, but even they move aside at the arrival of Jean Innocent, in her official car, her sharpest suit and what Hathaway once dubbed \u2018The Earrings of Shock and Awe'.\n\u201cLewis! What the hell are you doing here!? I ordered you to keep your nose out of this case.\u201d\n\u201cMa'am, I...\u201d But before Robbie can muster a defence, Maitland has stepped ahead of him into the line of fire.\n\u201cInspector Lewis is here at my request, Ma'am. His presence and quick thinking almost certainly prevented a further tragedy this afternoon.\u201d\nInnocent is barely mollified. \u201cThat does not explain what he was doing at seven this morning, breaking into an unreleased crime scene, against my express orders.\u201d\nLewis catches Maitland's eye, but she shakes her head.\n\u201cDon't look at her, Lewis.\u201d Innocent sighs, and pinches the pad of flesh between her eyebrows. \u201cYou weren\u2019t snitched, you were spotted by the press. I've just spent a hair-raising twenty minutes persuading the Mail on Sunday not to make you the pin-up of tomorrow's page five. As you know, our tabloids just love a bank holiday murder. What on earth were you doing there anyway?\u201d\n\u201cJust looking out for my partner,\u201d he tries, conviction is leaking away from his voice. This is the version of Innocent which unnerves him most, aggravating, attractive, almost invariably in the right.\n\u201cYour ex-partner. Inspector Hathaway is a grown-up now. He at least seems to understand the minefield we are negotiating. And you \u2013 you of all people \u2013 are the one setting off the explosions. Oh, for the love...\u201d The last is in response to the arrival of Ben Black, crime reporter of the Oxford Mail, in a familiar Ford Focus. \u201cThere\u2019s no bloody escaping them. My car. Now,\u201d she hisses. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d\nInnocent's driver loiters on the grass a few paces away, as Robbie and Maitland, shielded behind the Volvo\u2019s tinted glass, lay out the events of the last few hours, from the Widow Dunn's melt-down to the discovery of Dunn's secret photographic stash.\n\u201cHidden in a folder behind the bath panel,\u201d Robbie explains as he finally surrenders the pictures.\n\u201cThese are definitely of DI Hathaway?\u201d Maitland leafs through the pile with intense, professional interest. \u201cI don't know him, of course,\u201d she passes the curled sheets across the console to Innocent, \u201cbut - would you say they were credible blackmail material?\u201d\nRobbie sees the spot of pink, high on Jean's cheek, as she realises what she is studying.\n\u201cInspector Hathaway has always struck me as a deeply private person, but, well\u2026 surely this is no worse than you\u2019d see in aftershave advertisement. Or those tasteful studio portraits buy for their partners at Christmas \u2013 you know the sort of thing? Lewis?\u201d\n\u201cErr, I never, really \u2013 not, um. Ma'am.\u201d It\u2019s Robbie\u2019s turn to feel his face warm, as he tries very hard not to imagine Mr Innocent opening his Christmas present, and fails. \u201cAnd,\u201d he continues, \u201cthat would line up with Hathaway's statement \u2013 he was just modelling for a friend with an artistic hobby.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we can tell it stayed a hobby,\u201d Maitland adds, \u201cuntil last year, when he lost his job at the school and set up as a wedding photographer.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I spoke to Mrs Dunn, yesterday\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLewis!\u201d\n\u201cI was just providing a shoulder to cry on, Ma\u2019am. Anyway, the widow said Dunn started the business with money from an elderly uncle \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to trace him, without success. The girl has never met him \u2013 but, De Souza found this.\u201d Maitland passes over a copied bank statement. \u201cThree payments into Dunn's account in cash \u2013 eight hundred in October and November, five in early December. So, shortly after Mrs Dunn falls pregnant - \u201c\n\u201cBut before,\u201d Robbie jumps in, \u201cHathaway says he met Dunn in the Covered Market handing out flyers and renewed their acquaintance.\u201d\n\u201cSo \u2013 what? Another, earlier blackmail attempt? Another victim?\u201d Innocent glances again at the photographs in her hand. \u201cWhy would that victim run dry in December, and force Dunn to make this clumsy pass at Hathaway? Did they run out of cash? Or find a backbone?\u201d\nOr fall sick, Robbie thinks. \u2018He is protecting me\u2019, that\u2019s what the priest had said. From what, old man? What secret have you shared with James and Dunn?\n\u201cThe scrap of photograph in Dunn\u2019s hand when he died, have we had any joyidentifying that?\u201d Innocent hands the papers back to Maitland. \u201cFind the photo, find the pressure. Find the pressure, find the victim, and find the victim\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a photo, it\u2019s probably in the house. We\u2019ll find it. I\u2019ll take the house apart.\u201d\nAnd Maitland is gone, leaving Robbie and Jean alone together, side by side in the rear seats, like anxious parents on a sofa.\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d she asks, staring at her own folded hand.\n\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t even try. I know you both too well. Nothing seems to keep you two apart for long. So, how\u2019s James doing?\u201d\n\u201cNot good.\u201d Robbie swallows the sudden taste of bile and anger flooding his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s not himself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe \u2013 well, had a bit of go at me.\u201d\n\u201cJames attacked you!?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Not attack. Not really. Just \u2013 I think I may have hit a raw nerve, and it set him off.\u201d\n\u201cRobbie. You know you can't be involved in this. You are one of the best officers I know: smart, tough, loyal, infuriating \u2013 and you seem determined to make the whole bloody mess worse than it already is. Turning over crime scenes, removing evidence, chatting to material witnesses. Have you lost your senses? Can you imagine anything more likely to suggest a police cover-up where none actually exists? And then to get caught by the bloody press doing it! Take a look\u2026\u201d\nShe hauls out her phone and scrolls through. Yes. There he is, looking left and right before breaking the tape on James\u2019s door. Remarkably shifty, he thinks, every inch a man burdened with a guilty conscience. Had he been followed since? He wonders if there are other shots of him, browsing for underpants in Austin Reed, showing up at St Anthony\u2019s bearing gifts \u2013 or arguing in the street with a man in borrowed clothes, a split lip and a ragged two-day beard?\n\u201cIgnore them. Those bastards have been making it up as long as I've known them. It's all a comedy to them. Keystone Kops. They spot a cop drinking wine \u2013 then he\u2019s Lord Snooty, a clueless ponce. A bloke like me \u2013 well, then they\u2019ll make me the dumb one, couldn't detect his arse in his own trousers. They see what they want to see, write what they want to write!\u201d\n\u201cThey should have no reason to see you at all!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would suspending me prove to your bloody press, except that you don't trust your own officers?\u201d\n\u201cRobbie, I trust you with my life! Just not with managing your own. You know better than this. It looks like collusion, and you know better than most how dangerous that is right now. The media hardly need any more evidence of police corruption. They have it, by the stinking skip load. Jack Cornish's little venture fades into insignificance after the last year. When Morton rang me the night before the Bullfinch arrests, and told me what he\u2019d found. God, heartbreaking isn\u2019t the word. We abandoned those children to years of abuse.1 Hillsborough, Tomlinson, the Lawrence Family.2 It goes on and on, week after week, shaming us all. These aren\u2019t Keystone comedies \u2013 they\u2019re bloody disasters, with one thing in common. Police officers, just like us, lying, destroying evidence, forging statements, protecting ourselves and trampling the very people who need our protection most. Why should anyone trust us now?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s got nothing to do with you or me! Christ, Jean \u2013 that\u2019s everything I\u2019ve fought against. All my career! You know that. And James? Of all people \u2013 James?\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Innocent sighs.\nIn the yellowed gloom cast by the Volvo\u2019s tinted windows, she seems haggard, as tired as he feels.\nFunny, how Robbie's always thought of her as younger, but in truth there's barely eight years between them, and she was an inspector long before him.\n\u201cWe won. That's the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cOur generation. The good guys. We fought to bury that world, deals in smoke-filled pubs and Masonic lodges, all that cosying up to power, and looking after our own. This isn\u2019t the Sweeney anymore; it\u2019s supposed to be a new world of clean, independent, accountable policing. We won, Robbie, and now we're on our own.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the government on our side, thanks to those idiots who thought they could blackmail the Home Secretary over one foul-mouthed Chief Whip.3. After Plebgate we\u2019ll be lucky if the Tories don\u2019t flog off the whole police service to Securicor or G4S, or whatever they\u2019re called these days. It\u2019s not just James\u2019s career we\u2019re trying to save - it\u2019s all the whole deal, the job, your bloody pension - and the safety of all those...\u201d She taps gently on the glass separating them from the kids on bikes, the teenage dads, the grandmas, the good, the bad, the indifferent citizens of Oxford.\n\u201cSo, what? We just turn on each other instead?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, and you know it \u2013 but if we put one foot wrong, under this level of scrutiny, we\u2019ll introduce enough doubt to lose the case, and James\u2019s name and career will be toast with it. Gone. James understands what is at stake. He knows why he has to keep his head down right now and let us handle this.\u201d\nRobbie thinks of a pale, dishevelled figure, red raw with distress, in a coat at once too wide and too short, spitting fury at him. Yes, James understands only too well.\nThey both sense the stir in the doorway of the Dunn house, the sudden intense interest quickening the rhythm of routine secure and search.\n\u201cIt has to be by the book now, Robbie. Squeaky clean. James has to be treated like any other suspect until this is over.\u201d They watch DC Hooper, suited and booted in Tyvek, emerging into the daylight with purposeful tread. \u201cGo home. Have an early night. Relax.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I?\u201d he replies, his eye on the object Hooper holds aloft\u2014small, soft, gleaming within the evidence bag.\n\u201cThose photographs \u2013 of James. That's not blackmail material.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he agrees.\n\u201cAnd even a rank amateur like Dunn would know that.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhich means Dunn believed he had something \u2013 or someone \u2013 else to burn James with.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIf we find it - whatever it is \u2013 we will deal with it. Properly. I promise. We'll get through this, by following the rules.\u201d Hooper is walking towards the car now, oblivious of the cameras, the thing in his gloved hand, hanging obscenely.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he says. And he does.\n\u201cRobbie. Just tell me \u2013 please. Is there anything else you know that could help?\u201d\n\u2018He is protecting me\u2019, the old man said. But who is protecting you, James?\n\u201cSt Anthony\u2019s House. It\u2019s where Dunn and Hathaway met, ten years back. Whatever it is, it probably happened there. I think it\u2019s still happening there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where he\u2019s staying now?\u201d Innocent squeezes her eyes shut, pinches the bridge of her nose. \u201cAnd I hoped James was the sane one. Listen to me. You are going to disappear. You are on leave, as of this moment. If I find you within book throwing distance of any of the crime scenes, or the suspects, or the investigating officers, or St Whatever\u2019s bloody house, I will have you both suspended. Lewis. Do you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cI hear you.\u201d\nInnocent stabs a button at her side, and the window descends to reveal Hooper's broad flat face and the bulging sack of knotted latex, trapped in the bag like a goldfish won at the fair. A condom. Pack of three, one missing. Missing no longer.\n\u201cTaped to the top of the cistern, Ma'am. Looks like there's a container inside. One of those old-fashioned film cans.\u201d\nA drop of water falls and drips on the sill.\n\u201cSo get it to forensics, Hooper. Now!\u201d The tinted glass whines upward again, and the car fills with cool, quiet gloom like rising water.\n\u201cGo home to Laura, Robbie. Please. For all our sakes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n[Warning; The links below lead to articles covering potentially distressing events, including lethal police violence, crowd crushing resulting in death and injury and the abuse of children.]\n\u00a0\n1 Operation Bullfinch: Thames Valley has been heavily criticised in a Serious Case Review into the sexual exploitation of young girls in Oxford, 2005-2013, which found police had been aware of the abuse of girls, which was finally exposed in its Operation Bullfinch, but failed to pursue investigations or even record it as a crime:\n2Hillsborough Disaster: The impact of the 2012 report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel into, 25 years after the event, is devastating. The three findings which have most relevance to the conduct of the police can be summarised as follows. 1) The fatal crush at the Hillsborough Stadium was primarily caused by \u201clack of police control\u201d; 2.) .that \u201cup to 41\u201d of the 96 who perished might have survived had the emergency services' reactions and co-ordination been improved, and that 3) South Yorkshire Police attempted to divert attention from the failing of their own officers and throw blame onto the victims by altering 164 witness statements, performing blood alcohol tests on the victims, some of them children, and running computer checks on the national police database in an attempt to \u201cimpugn their reputation\u201d, and passing inaccurate and untrue information to the press via the then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, Irvine Patnick.\nIan Tomlinson a newspaper seller died while making his way home through a political demonstration in the city of London. The first Police statements reported that Tomlinson had collapsed and been given first aid by police officers, an account supported by the autopsy result, which suggested a sudden heart attack. A week later mobile phone footage emerged which clearly showed that Tomlinson had been subjected to an unprovoked attack by a police officer, and that the pathologist had failed to record the brusing to Tomlinson\u2019s head and body, and had destroyed blood and fluid samples.\n3Plebgate: In 2012 Conservation MP and Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell swore at a Police Officer on duty at the gates to 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister, and was forced to resign as result.\nThis event was misused by senior members of the Police Federation, (the police union) to apply pressure to the Home Secretary in the midst of a dispute over pay, pensions and conditions. As a result five police officers have, to date, been dismissed from the service, and one convicted of misconduct and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.\nInnocent is right to be concerned about the fallout: in May 2014, less than a month after this conversation with DI Lewis, the Home Secretary addressed the Police Federation, demanded that it address serious concerns over Police integrity and honesty, and abruptly ending its public funding.\n", "30": "\nChapter Text\nLater, Robbie will find he has no idea how long he drove that Saturday afternoon, and only fleeting impressions of where, but by the time he parks on the fringes of the sprawling car park surrounding Fry's Hill Leisure Park, the day\u2019s light is failing.Somewhere out there, in the twilight, is the dip in the earth which cradled Mickey Dunn, resting along with the litter of Oxford\u2019s fleeting life, the fag-ends, fast food boxes, screwed up flyers and chocolate wrappers.There are grease-stained wrappers on Robbie\u2019s dashboard and a queasy heaviness in his gut from the coffee he sipped as he listened to the evening news.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt a press conference earlier this afternoon, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent of Oxford Police addressed concerns about public safety at Fry's Hill since the discovery of a body there in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\n\n\"The death of Michael Dunn is being treated as a murder enquiry. I would like to stress at this point that we have no evidence that Mr Dunn was attacked at the Fry's Park site, or that his death is linked to the on-going controversy over use of the car park by some groups within the community.\n\n\n\"Mr Dunn's family deserve to know how and why their loved one died, whatever the circumstances, and I urge anyone who may know of his movements in the hours and days before his death to come forward, in complete confidence.\u201d\n\n\nEarlier today an ambulance attended an address on the Blackbird Leys Estate, and removed a woman, believed to be Dunn's wife, to hospital. Police teams moved to search the two-bedroom house shortly afterwards. \n\n\nAnother property, a flat in the Cowley Road area, identified by neighbours this evening as the home of Detective Inspector James Hathaway, remains sealed and under guard.\n\n\nSuperintendent Innocent refused to confirm rumours that two officers have now been removed from the investigation.\n\n\nIn recent months Oxford police have been at pains to restore public confidence, after the convictions in the Cornish corruption case, and severe, on-going criticism of handling of the sexual exploitation of minors over many years.\u201d\n\nThe radio is silent, but the lights from the great retail flagships of Fry\u2019s Hill are still stuttering out an SOS to the world: Buy. Eat. Play. Save. Save. Save.Robbie's head is full of fragments, as it has been all afternoon, a virtual incident room plastered with pieces of reality in an attempt to glimpse a pattern, a coherent working whole through his anger and frustration and grief.For Morse the facts of a case had always been a puzzle, clusters of letters scrawled in the margins to be manipulated neatly into place. A solution. Five down, thirteen across, fencing in the sordid misery and mess of human life.But in all these years of work, Robbie had never been able to shake off the image of Lyn crouched on the living room carpet playing with paper dolls, dressing them from a shoebox of frocks, hats and shoes she cut from random magazines. She\u2019d sit back, and squint at her work: tweak, adjust, tumble scraps back into the box and start again, hour after hour.And that, he had long since realised, is all his job entailed, with its whiteboards and photographs and forensics and bits of string; cutting and folding and hanging scraps of evidence into a human form, trying to find a fit. A reasonable, rational costume for the case to wear on its big day in court. An approximation of truth, good enough to live with.No wonder old lags call the process \u2018a fit up\u2019.For hours nowhe has been sifting the litter of his memory, trying them on, stripping them off, throwing them back to start again. And all the time he knows he is avoiding one tough, twisted little scrap lurking at the bottom of the box. It has been waiting stubbornly for him, just as this place has been waiting patiently for his arrival at the end of his long circular journey through the Thames Valley.This is the place where it started, two nights ago, where he watched from the shadows as James walked away from him, into the halo of white light around a dead man, and became something strange and new.\u2018Sins of omission\u2019, James had muttered, sitting beside him in this place, in this very car. A half apology for what was to come; \u2018I have no secrets\u2026 my superiors knew that I had sex with men. I lied\u2019.The purple streaked sky has disappeared. Darkness extends above and below. Only the signs of remain. Buy Me. Play Me. Eat Me.Out there, right now, at this moment, in the darkness all around him, strangers are meeting, coupling, losing themselves in a few moments of sightless, anonymous friction.How would it feel, he wonders. A blind exchange of heat, scent, a slide of skin, a handful of hair, a mouthful of flesh, without weight, without meaning, without personality, without a past or future. Is that its sole appeal?James is not weightless. Robbie knows to a scruple the heft of his body against him, slumping into sleep after pizza and beer and long hours at work.He knows the warmth of James's breath, damp on his neck, the precise scent of sweat, smoke, salt, hops, petrol, sometimes grass and once, as James\u2019s eye twitched at a dream world, the sharp, lactic tang of desire.He knows the exact imprint of skin on skin, the silky rasp of close-cropped hair, the still, silent content stealing through him as James\u2019s body falls across his on the shared sofa.All Dunn's photographs have supplied to his imagination is detail; violet shadows under arms, chest, belly, thighs; a glistening trail of hair leading the eye downward.There must be a storm brewing, thunder, somewhere. His skin is tingling.Every breath seems hard won, as through water. There is furious pain in his chest, a gripping anger, so very like grief, a sense of the ground slipping\u00a0away from him. He is in free-fall, tumbling, no longer sure if the darkness above him is earth or sky.His hands clutch, convulsively, holding fast to reality. Something tears, beneath his fingers.He has broken through something. Fragile. In his left pocket. A shell of rustling tissue-paper and ribbon. His forgotten gift, a sea-green tie. Coils of cool darkness, opening to his clumsy fingers, yielding, sliding over skin.The scrap of knowledge Robbie has been skirting all these hours is now ready, hammering at his chest for release, illuminating dim corners in the vault of his skull, just within his grasp...Suddenly blind, in pain, Robbie flings up his hand, cringes from the white light flooding the car.A gloved hand raps on the window.\"Oi! Hands on the dashboard where I can see them!\"There\u2019s two of them, in the familiar silhouette of flat caps and stab-proof vest. A crackle of radio. And then an even more familiar voice: \"You plonker, Stebbins. That\u2019s the boss. Evening, Sir.\u201d\"Jonesie?\" Robbie blinks at the orange afterimage the torch has branded across his sight. His face is burning, although he has done nothing more incriminating than tangle his fist into a knot of silk and paper.\"Say hello to Inspector Lewis, Stebbins. Good lad. Now \u2018op it and let the grown-ups talk. He\u2019s a probationer, from Banbury. We've got six teams out here. Just canvassing the area, warning folk, checking if the regulars saw ought unusual last Thursday.\"Robbie can see them both now, the reassuring bearded bulk of PC Jones, leaning companionably against the door frame, his improbably young partner hanging back sheepishly.\"Anything of interest turn up?\"\"Nah. Though bloody murder hasn't put the doggers off one stroke. God above, the muck we\u2019ve seen. And it\u2019s not yet ten. You couldn't imagine the half of it. I think it\u2019s turned young Stebbins's head!\"\"I think you\u2019re supposed to be enlisting the community's support, Constable, not perving on them.\"Jones draws himself up. \"Right you are, sir.\"\"Oh, ignore me, Jonesie. I'm not checking up on you. Just pulled in on the way home.\"\"And if you don't mind me saying, home\u2019s where you ought to be - you look done in. Come on, lad. Let's go complete your sexual education.\"And the light is gone, bobbing along the ground, between the parked cars.Robbie wipes his face with relief. He is puzzled when his hand comes away wet.Christ, no wonder Jones gave him such a strange look. How long has he been crying?Will that feature in their report - or only in station gossip? So much for keeping a low profile.Though, oddly enough, he trusts Jones to keep it to himself. The man\u2019s been a copper enough to know that tears are, in the end, just part of the job.

Innocent's last order.So he does.\n", "31": "\nChapter Text\nThere is golden light streaming out of the house, from the window, from the rippled glass of the door, pouring over the neglected patch of grass and gravel that Robbie calls a drive. It picks out the lines of the VW Golf parked in front of his bay window, and flickers between the blinds as Laura paces, her fair head bent over her phone.\nThere is a peace in this he had never thought to feel again, the simple pleasure of returning home in anticipation of warmth, lamplight and a human voice raised in welcome.\nLaura is still speaking as he opens his front door.\n\u201cOh God, Jean... it's okay. He just walked in. I'm sorry - no really, thank you for listening to me blathering on! We'll be okay now.\u201d\nHe's not even dropped his keys before she has her arms around him.\nWe will, he thinks. Be okay.\nHe presses his face into the clean, sweet cloud of her hair. He can stop now, perhaps. Be warmed, for a moment, an hour, a day, the rest of his life. Held. Quiet. Freed from the compulsion to scratch endlessly through the litter in his own skull.\n\u201cWhere have you been, my love? I've been at my wit's end!\u201d\n\u201cSssh.\u201d\nLaura's scent, clean. Pink. Expensive lotions, violets and Hibiscrub. It tickles. Sweet. Lingering. Like flowers in cellophane on a hot afternoon.\nHe releases her, gently, letting the cooler evening air seep between them, until she moves back an inch of her own volition.\n\u201cWhere did you put it?\u201d\n\u201cPut what?\u201d For a moment he's lost.\n\u201cRobbie. I left an entirely illicit copy of the SOCO report for you in the car last night. Please tell me you found it. Please, please, tell me you haven't been driving around Oxford with it lying on the front seat.\u201d\n\u201cDon't fret.\u201d He lifts a sofa cushion. \u201cHere.\u201d\nLaura snatches up the contraband folder. \u201cI shouldn't have done this.\u201d She folds it to her chest. \u201cEven for you. Or James. Either of you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You shouldn't.\u201d He drops a kiss onto her forehead and his keys onto the table. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d\n\u201cAnything useful..?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. I don't know.\u201d He passes a hand over his face. \u201cSorry love, I'm knackered.\u201d\n\u201cProbably famished as well. Just sit there. I dropped in at Waitrose on the way over.\u201d The green and white carriers are bulging over the kitchen counter. Pizza, bags of pre-washed salad, bottles of wine. Posh pizza. Neither of them has ever pretended to be cooks, but at least Laura has introduced him to a better class of junk.\nBelow, the washing machine door is ajar, just as left this morning, sheet and duvet cover stuffed inside, dry, crumpled and unwashed. He should make the bed, but right now he can't find the will to rise from the sofa.\n\u201cS'alright,\u201d he says. \u201cI grabbed something earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWine, then.\u201d Laura rummages in the drawer for a corkscrew. \u201cYou look like you could do with a drink.\u201d\nWhat he really needs is a Zantac; this afternoon's pasty seems to be sitting just under his ribs, but all he can find to say is, \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d\n\u201cGlasses. Glasses.\u201d Laura stretches high into the cupboard overhead. \u201cJean said you found some photographs at the victim's house.\u201d\n\u201cUmmm.\u201d\n\u201cOf James.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Robbie shifts on the sofa to make space. It's grown soft, sagging as Laura joins him, rolling them together, thigh to thigh. He's dozed through too many nights here. It won't make the next move with him, to his next home. The one he and Laura will share.\n\u201cNeck rub?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cBudge up then.\u201d Her fingers are cool and strong. The needle of pain behind Robbie\u2019s right eye starts to recede.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d\n\u201cThe photographs...\u201d\n\u201cI'm off the case.\u201d\n\u201cI know you too well, Robbie Lewis. You're like a dog with a bone - you're either chewing on it or burying it.\u201d Her thumbs dig into the base of his skull, and he winces, at the sudden pain, at the over-bright images in his head.\n\u201cThey're just pictures, Laura. A lad with his kit off, looking moody. Wouldn't turn many heads.\u201d\n\u201cThey'd turn mine. Hey, Robbie, come on, smile - it's a joke!\u201d\n\u201cDo you think he's attractive?\u201d Robbie shifts to face her, taking one hand in his. The other still rests gently on his neck.\nLaura's brow furrows, not, he thinks, at the question itself, but at the stillness in him.\n\u201cI've probably known him too long now - but yes, I remember thinking that the new sergeant was bloody gorgeous. In an angular sort of way.\u201d\n\u201cAn equine eleven.\u201d\n\u201cDid I say that?\u201d\n\u201cDo you fancy him?\u201d\n\u201cRobbie?\u201d\n\u201cWell, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI - No. Maybe, once. But now? No - he's a friend, a colleague.\u201d\nHe sighs. \u201cSo am I.\u201d The ambiguity of his words turns, unspoken, on his tongue; your colleague, my colleague.\n\u201cAnd I've got my hands quite full enough with you!\u201d She takes the points of his collar and pulls him forward to meet in a kiss, soft, lips barely parted, the merest hint of wine on warm breath.\nHis hands slide over her waist, her back, under her shirt, the silk as soft and smooth as her skin. He could be happy, here, buried in Laura's embrace.\nHis fingers trace the curve of her breast. He has come to know this fold of soft flesh as precisely as he remembers the weight of James's hand, fallen in innocent sleep across his thigh. More so, for all the times he has cupped it, pressed his lips to it, loved it as he loves her. It is like Laura herself, pert and self-contained, pink and gold, and sweet and salt. Its curve is a smile.\nHer breathing quickens, her lips open to his, her taste oddly bitter. He can feel her heart under his palm, thready, out of step, moving rapidly along a path he cannot follow.\nHer nipple rises and stiffens.\nNothing stiffens in him.\nHe can choose to continue. He has already learned how to make her breath quicken though his does not, to make her body stir and shiver with hands and lips and tongue. Surely there is a satisfaction to be found in that? He would die to keep her safe, so he can work to make her happy.\nBut that is not what Laura needs or asks from him.\nSomehow she must sense the ambivalence of his touch. She pulls back, her eyes open, her hands tugging her shirt back into place.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me as if I'm a puzzle to be solved,\u201d she says and reaches for her glass. \u201cOr a tricky bit of DIY.\u201d It\u2019s a rebuke, albeit spoken without rancour.\nThat\u2019s the problem. Laura does not lie. She has never sweetened the truth for him and demands the same honesty in return.\n\u201cI'm the puzzle.\u201d His own wine sits untouched. \u201cLaura - if this was all there was. The two of us, bottle of wine, sofa, telly, someone to come home to. Would it be enough?\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d she says, rubbing his shoulder with brisk affection, \u201cit's been a tough few days. We'll talk another time...\u201d\n\u201cBecause I think this is all there is. All there can be.\u201d\n\u201cWe can work this out...\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing to work with.\u201d There, it\u2019s said. \u201cLaura. It's not the plumbing.\u201d It feels almost like an admission of infidelity, and he blushes despite himself. \u201cFar as I can tell, the plumbing is fine.\u201d\nHer eyes narrow. \u201cSo. It\u2019s the wiring, after all. \u201c\nHe folds her hand in both of his, kisses it. \u201cLaura, you are my oldest, dearest friend...\u201d\n\u201cLess of the old, if you don't mind.\u201d\n\u201cYou have always been the one person I could trust to speak the truth, even when it hurt.\u201d\n\u201cI sound like a monster.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have never compromised. Never settled. In all the years I\u2019ve known you. If I thought I could give you more, I would. I'd move heaven and earth. But if this - if this is all there is, all I have, if you tell me it\u2019s enough for you, I'll draw the curtains and spend the rest of my life here, trying to make you happy.\u201d\nLaura gently disengages her hand to refresh her glass, but thinks better of it, and replaces the bottle unpoured.\n\u201cThere is something I need to know,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAnything. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cIs there someone else?\u201d\nYes. \u201cNo. What makes you ask that?\u201d\n\u201cYou just seem so certain.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she says, \u201chow did you know that Val was the \u2018One\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cGod, Laura-\u201d Relief and guilt pair up to kick him in the gut. \u201cI didn't mean to...\u201d Mean what? To tell you that my love for you is limited, grudging. \u201dIf I've ever made you feel second best...\u201d\n\u201cSsssh, no. Robbie, no. I didn't mean that. It's okay. It really is.\u201d She brushes the hair back from his forehead with a tenderness that makes him want to weep. \u201dI'm just curious, honestly. All right, maybe, I'm a tiny bit envious. But not of Val - of you.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201dYou\u2019ve experienced something rare, something I\u2019ve never known or understood, and all these years I\u2019ve been too much of a coward to ask.\u201d\n\u201cHow would it help?\"\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be scientist. I\u2019ve been staring into the secrets of the heart every day of my life for twenty years. To understand a thing, I should lay out the pieces and look, with open eyes and mind. So. Help me now. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn't. Know, I mean-\u201d Robbie sighs, and closes his eyes. \u201dWe weren't even a couple. My mate was going out with a girl at the Poly. Val was the flatmate, but we used to end up together at the end of the evening, like a pair of gooseberries. Then they split up, and somehow Val and me just kept meeting up, every couple of weeks. Just someone to talk to, go to concerts, that sort of thing. Just friends. I must be really dense about these things, because... yes, alright, I know that smile, Doctor Hobson! I didn't get it. Until...\u201d\n\u201cUntil?\u201d\nHe shrugs. \u201cOne day she calls me, to say goodbye. Her auntie\u2019s sick, so she's going to drop out for a while, hitch-hike to Oxford, spend some time with him. I told her not be so daft \u2013 I\u2019d drive her. \"\nHis skin prickles with the memory of his first sight of Oxford, through the fog of a bitter November evening. \u201cWe talked, all the way down.\u00a0 First time I\u2019d been south of Birmingham, somehow I thought it would be warmer. \u00a0Dropped her at her auntie\u2019s, and I was just thinking how dull the drive back would be, on me own, when she leaned through the car door and kissed me First time - sure you want to hear this?\u201d\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cIt was like - like getting an electric shock. I thought my heart had stopped - couldn't even breathe. Wasn't sure if the world had turned upside down or just my stomach. And that was it. \u201d\nLaura looks almost relieved. \u201cThank you.\u201d She leans forward.\nHer closed lips brush his. Dry and warm and utterly chaste.\nThe world stays exactly as it was, the right way up.\nNothing has changed. Everything has changed.\nThey sit in silence, for a moment. Her glass almost empty, his untouched.\n\u201cI think,\u201d she says, at last, \u201cI think perhaps we could learn to live with what we have now. Or we might just learn to like each a little less, bit by bit, until there is nothing left except resentment.\u201d\nAnd only then does the colour drain from her cheeks, as if her admission has driven the breath from her lungs. She stands abruptly. \u201cI need air... No - stay here. Please. I just want some time.\u201d\nRobbie feels certain there must be a word or gesture that would hold her here, a minute, an hour longer. He tries neither.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk again, tomorrow,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and she is gone.\n\nCall her back.\n\nRobbie listens to the long minutes before Laura's car starts.\n\nGo to the door, you idiot. Call her back.\n\nHe sits until the growl of the engine fades into the distant swish of the ring road and silence fills the house again.\n\nOh, brilliant work, Lewis. \n\nTwo glasses of wine, one empty, one full.\n\nRoyally pissing off your two closest friends, in a single day? Congratulations.\n\nHe reaches for the wine. The glass topples and spills, turning in a perfect circle on the table top before falling to the floor. He lets the pieces lie. The bottle in the bookcase provides better comfort.\nThe first tumbler of whisky burns a path through the tight knot of misery in his chest.\nThe second becomes a toast. Cheers, Morse, you should be proud. Old, alone, and drinking.\nThe third slips down much, much more easily.\nMight as well go the whole hog. He pulls out the loudest, most miserable, most German looking CD he can lay his hand on, and flicks the volume up full.\nLoud enough to drown the clamour in his skull.\n\nAnd bugger the neighbours.\n\n", "32": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cWe climbed, he first and I behind, Until, through a small round opening ahead of us I saw the lovely things the heavens hold,\nAnd we came out to see once more the stars.\u201d\n\nDante. The Divine Comedy: Inferno Canto XXXIV, 135-9\n\n  \nLying here, in the dark, he can almost remember, once, he dreamed of sunlit streets, and air, and perhaps of something other than an endless blind pursuit.The stone beneath his cheek is tooth-piercing cold and dry, thirsty enough to pull skin from flesh, flesh from bone. Each time he falls he loses a little more, fraying palms, elbows, knees, fingers. He\u2019ll rise again, presently, and climb again.They must be far above the city now.Somewhere, in the cellarage, fathoms below, he thinks he was once the prey, that he waded through water, slime and fear, with the snap of teeth always at his heels. Now he is the hunter.He has been in the dark so long he has forgotten the light, and the faces of those who live in it \u2013 but he knows the Beast, as he saw it last, when he turned, in despair or defiance, and waited for its long jaws to tear at him.Instead, it merely gazed back at him, through weeping red-raw eyes, snarled once, and fled.It has been climbing ever since, every passage, doorway, crossing or stairwell leading upwards, until even the air grows cold and thin as a razor\u2019s edge.Once he saw it, in the turning of the stair above him, a grey gleam of lean haunches, the tip of its twitching tail. An icy breeze stirred his hair, and twisting upward, he glimpsed a fist-sized opening, far, far overhead, full of unmoved, unmoving stars, and the bones of his own outstretched hand before his face.It is still there, ahead of him. He can smell it, hear its pant, a skitter of claw on stone, the slow drip of drool. Waiting.\nFor what? \nHis limbs are nerveless, dead things beneath him. He must cling to the curved wall to rise.\nCome on, you bastard, I\u2019m all done. Finished. Take me.\nHe hears it retreat. Step by step. Ahead of him, beyond his reach.Another step. His heart pounds, blood bursting through brain, and lungs, his whole body thrust onward, upward, until with one last turn, he is spat out of darkness into light and space and airy gold.He sways on the parapet of a vast dome, one half-stumble from the brink.Below, far, far below, towers and spires, roofs, stairs, pavements, canals roll blue and grey, to a fine ribbon of glistening silver. At last. Far off. The glistening, undulating sea..His balls clench with terror and joy and an irresistible urge to leap into fathoms of warm air, and fall.He has forgotten the long climb.He has forgotten the darkness.He has almost forgotten the great beast that stalks him.Until he feels its hot breath on his neck.He gathers his anger in both fist, and seizes his tormentor.But finds only a man.Long and lean and gold and naked.One pale hand is stretched out to him, in greeting or supplication, or to display the red pearl in the hollow of the palm.The other is flung wide to stall a backward staggers towards the swimming abyss.For one lifetime-long heartbeat their fingers meet, and hold.Then James is falling back away from him, arm still outstretched, diminishing so slowly he seems almost to float over the great blue expanse of a destroying world.\n", "33": "\nChapter Text\nRobbie Lewis lands with a heart-stopping thud, on his own sofa, in the darkness of his own living room, his head pounding as hard as the pulse in his veins.\nHis hands are empty. Something falling, missing. He gropes blindly, feels glass, smooth and cool slide from fumbling fingers into his lap.\nOnly then does he recognise a third tattoo, beaten out in counterpoint on the front door. The almost empty whisky bottle spins to the carpet as he staggers upright, muttering, \u2018bloody neighbours\u2019, and wrenches back the door.\n\"She's only gone and called a dawn raid, battering ram, ITV film crew, the works.\" DC Hooper barrels past him, and a few steps behind, Frankie De Souza, a terrier snapping at the heels of a bloodhound. \"She's a mate of yours, in't she? Get on the blower, stop her.\"\nRobbie pushes the door shut. \"What the hell are you on, Hooper?\" The thumping behind his eyes refuses to ease. \"And why are you here,\" he checks his watch, \"at four in the bloody morning?\"\n\"Maitland,\" says De Souza, shoulders hunched. \"She's got a warrant.\"\nThe cold slide these words provoke in Robbie's gut has nothing to do with his hangover. \"On what grounds?\"\n\"Flight risk,\" Hooper says. \"Apparently this defrocked vicar club Hathaway\u2019s holed up with has links with Uganda...\"\n\"Uruguay,\" De Souza butts in with the correction.\n\"No extradition treaty, apparently.

We agreed, he has to see this.\"\nRobbie starts to see how this unlikely alliance is forming under pressure. De Souza, tight with facts and quiet fury, Hooper flailing in his outraged appeal to authority. His authority.\nHooper screws up his nose and pulls a creased manila envelope from his pocket, crams it into Robbie's hands, and steps back, thrusting his hands deep into his pockets as if his hands will never venture into the world again.\n\"You shouldn't be showing me this,\" Robbie says, but he has to see.\nHe has to know.\nHis mouth is dry, his palm damp. He hopes neither of them realises that his hands are shaking as he tears open the envelope.\nNow this. This really is blackmail material. Not art. No restrained placement of limbs and light and shadows.\nThis is what was called in his youth \u2018Gross Indecency contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 1967\u2019 or, more simply, cock-sucking.\nThis is James Hathaway.\nFucking.  \nWith another man.\nRobbie wants to look away, he wants to look closer, he wants to tear the two bodies apart with his shaking hands. He needs Hooper and De Souza to leave, now. He needs\u2026\n\u2026to concentrate on the specifics. On the evidence he is holding.\nThe photographs: Twelve shots in all, printed two up on A4 copier paper. Colour. A single unmoving point of view. Under lit. With a fish eye lens.\nNot pornography then. Blackmail from the start?\nThe subject: Two men. Naked. Corkscrewed together. One long and pale, upturned to the light, the other strong and broad and dark, face buried to his task.\nRobbie's mouth is dry. He is being watched, intently, impatiently for reaction. His face burns, skin crackling. He licks his lips. His lips are cracked.\nIdentity: James\u2019s lips are parted, head thrown back, neck and back arched, bowstring tight. One hand twined in his lover\u2019s hair, twisted into the glossy dark head bowed over his crotch, one hand is stretched, raised, corded and braided with another\u2019s strong, broad fingers.\nRobbie needs to breathe. He needs to seize his coat and run. He needs to see James arch like that under his touch.\nNo wonder Maitland got her warrant. No wonder Innocent dare not gainsay it.\nThese are images to kill for. To die for.\nRobbie\u2019s hand shakes a little. There's a buzzing in his ears that Robbie realises must be Hooper, speaking.\n\"...I bloody hate blackmailers. Bloodsucking scum, the lot of 'em...\"\nBut Robbie is hearing other voices, echoes from the previous day; \u201cYou can't help. This isn\u2019t something you can fix,\u201d and feeling the fierce grip of surprisingly strong fingers on his wrist - \u201cHe is protecting me.\u201d \nRobbie looks up, at the two unlikely allies standing in his living room. Two expectant faces, De Souza tight and miserable, Hooper bewildered, angry and trusting.\n\"Why are you here?\"\nHooper, cut off mid-rant, is simply bewildered. \"Boss?\"\n\"Why are you here? What the hell do you want from me?\"\n\"To stop it, of course. Because Hathaway might be a hoity-toity pansy pain in the backside, but he's our pain and it\u2019s our backside, and I'm not having some jumped up tart dragging him out of bed and into a black maria, just to hitch her way one more notch up the greasy pole to Chief Constable.\"\n\"And just how do you expect me to save him, eh? Fly him across the border in a single engine plane? To live out his life in exile in Cardiff - or Pontypool? Grow up, Hooper.\"\n\"Boss-\u201d\n\"This is isn\u2019t police work, Sir,\" De Souza cuts in, \"It\u2019s PR, and you know it.\u201d\n\"So do your jobs! You are cops, right? Find the evidence. Find the killer. Whoever it is.\" Robbie thrusts the bundle back into De Souza arms. \u201cAnd destroy these, for Chrissakes, or say goodbye to your careers.\u201d And his, and mine. One sheet falls to the carpet, face up. Something has been loosed into his world that can never be safely locked up again.\n\"They'll kill him, boss,\u201d says Hooper, quietly. \"A queer bent copper on remand? Every hard man we've ever sent down will be lining up to shiv him, first time he opens that big clever gob of his. I know. I've wanted to often enough.\n\"You seen Jack Cornish recently? No, thought not. Washed your hands of him, you did, when you finally sent him down. It\u2019s not pretty. He told me he didn't sleep for the first three months, leastwise not with both eyes closed, and they still got to him. Hathaway\u2019s your boy \u2013they'll eat him alive in there, and if we don't care, who does?\"\nRobbie just stares at Alan Hooper\u2019s fat, flat, hopeful face, round as a stopped grandfather clock, and right twice a day despite himself, and for all the wrong reasons.\nGod knows he\u2019s led enough dawn raids in his own career. It\u2019s all just theatre, a familiar script; the audience assembling, cameras rolling, hi-vis jackets, smashed doors, the long walk into shot, carefully framing the picture they all want; the shamed perpetrator, dragged from his seedy refuge to be paraded before the gawping world, cringing from the flash of lights. Barefoot, red-eyed, robed in a sacrificial blanket of guilt.\nFitted up. Like one of Lyn's paper dolls.\n\nI tried to hold him and I let him fall. \n\nRobbie reaches for the hanger on the back of the bedroom door. \u201cSergeant De Souza. Go back to the nick, re-join your team and make sure you do exactly what you are ordered to do. Do you understand?\" As he pulls on the clean shirt, the pink cleaning slip flutters to the carpet.\nHe cuts short De Souza\u2019s protest. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done what\u2019s needed. You're young, your career matters. I don\u2019t want you to get caught up on the wrong side of whatever happens next.\u201d\nHe is moving now on autopilot, as on so many other early morning calls to action; tucking a fresh shirt into yesterday\u2019s clothes and checking the toolkit, keys, phone, handkerchief, and torch. Polo mints to substitute for toothpaste and a night\u2019s sleep.\nExcept \u2013 James should be waiting for him, hovering on his doorstep, a burning ember in the pre-dawn chill.\n\"Whereas, this fat bastard here is almost as old and useless as me.\"\n\"Well thanks, Boss,\" says Hooper, uncertainly, clearly still unsure at the change in his superior's demeanour.\n\"Have you got cash on you? Here\u2019s twenty \u2013 no, forty quid. You go to Khan's, right now. The dry-cleaner in the parade? He lives above the shop, so you keep ringing the bloody bell until he's up and cooperative. I want everything Inspector Hathaway's got in his shop; suit, shirt, the lot.\" He pulls on his own jacket, checks his pockets. Keys, phone, even the tattered coil of silk and tissue. \u201cAnd shoes \u2013 check behind the heel-bar.\u201d\n\"Then you bring them right round to Isis Way. Discreetly, mind. Park at least a street away and wait for directions.\u201d\n", "34": "\nChapter Text\nEvery city has a still point in its day, the hour before dawn, when the young have roared home from clubs and pubs and parties, the old have yet to rise and draw back their curtains, and the keen have yet to pull on their running shoes.\nRobbie dare not match his speed to his concern or his racing heartbeat. His time is limited, but he is still, he realises, more than a little drunk, and attention is the last thing he needs or wants at this moment.\nHe has his radio scanner on, reading meaning into the operational chatter. He can place himself exactly among the team assembling, right now, back in Cowley, polystyrene coffee cups and stab-proof vests, the mood uneasy, banter subdued by knowledge that this time the target may be one of their own.\nThe press will be with them by now, carefully chosen and corralled \u2013 \u201cembedded\u201d, inthe phrase Petersen borrowed from the military. The promise of an exclusive, the money shot, the ram breaking the lock, will make them dependent, biddable. But it also dictates the timing of the raid. A TV crew prefers full daylight, so Robbie calculates he has at least 50 minutes to reach James before them.\nHis palms sweat on the wheel as Robbie passes the turn into Isis Way. He\u2019s plotting the area in his head as he drives, calling on decades of knowledge to guide him. St Anthony\u2019s will already be under observation, but he must gamble that the stretch to the rear of the house may yet be accessible.\nThere, there it is. A familiar looking chip van, shuttered and silent, which conceals cameras and two coppers rather than cooling fat, parked at the corner with an oblique view of the street and of St Anthony\u2019s itself, behind the screen of ivy and winter trees.\nIf he turns just here, yes, behind the Nursing Home and the old tennis courts, he can park out of sight, cut through the alley to the back of the house, and hope to reach his goal before his colleagues move in.\nHe lopes across the crescent to the Pattersons\u2019 snug little bungalow and into the neat garden backing onto St Anthony\u2019s, more confident now that the annex is not under observation yet.\nThe wall, which seemed so slight the day before, looks daunting now, and the house beyond, black and lifeless, its windows blank and empty. There\u2019s no ivy here to provide a convenient route over, no crumbled bricks .Conn is far too meticulous a home-owner for that, and Robbie has no sergeant to boost him the three or four feet to grasp the coping.\nHe casts around for an alternative, a garden chair or tub. The shed is chained and locked, and neither padlock nor hasp will yield to his hand. He stoops to pull a rock from the neat border and raises it overhead to smash the lock asunder.\n\"Who's that!? Come out where I can see you!\"\n\"Conn?\u201d Robbie turns to the source of the light, and winces at the brightness of the beam playing across his eyes. \u201cFor Chrissakes, man, keep your voice down.\u201d\n\"I'll call the police!\"\n\"I am the police!\n\"Mr Lewis\u2026?\u201d Conn materialises, in slippers and ironed pyjamas, and with a crowbar clutched in one pudgy fist. \u201cI thought you was burglars!\u201d\n\u201cConn. Can I get into St Anthony\u2019s from the back?\u201d\n\u201cThere used to be a wicket gate \u2013 but Father Waite had it bricked up years back. God rest his soul.\u201d\nThe ground shifts under Robbie\u2019s feet in a way that has nothing to do with whiskey. \u201cWaite\u2019s dead?\"\n\u201cLast night, about ten. At home, in his own bed, mind, with all those lads around him. My Mo is ever so upset, what with that and a killer on the loose. Can\u2019t barely sleep. You lot any closer to finding out what happened to poor Mr Dunn?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d says Robbie, glancing up to the sagging bulk of the annex, slumped against the older, larger parent building. The ties holding James to this place and to his silence are dissolving now, even as the old man\u2019s body cools.\nAnd there, he glimpses, high above, a single point of light, a glowing ember, so close he might almost taste the smoke, yet far beyond his reach.\n\u201cWhat we need is in there,\u201d he says, and \u201cCan you help me?\u201d\nConn peers at him, stupidly, the crowbar still raised awkwardly as if embarrassed to be caught with it in his hand.\n\u201cConn? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nThat\u2019s all I need, thinks Robbie, seeing Maureen Patterson outlined in the kitchen door. Why not call the whole Crescent over, we can drink coffee and discuss setting up a bloody neighbourhood watch scheme.\n\u201cShussh, love, nothing to worry about. It\u2019s just Inspector Lewis. He\u2019s asked me to help find the killer.\u201d And with that, Conn seems to put his doubts and scurries into action, fetching a bunch of keys, unlocking the shed and helping to prop the short ladder against the wall, and all the while Robbie frets, and texts, and dreads the lights and cries that would herald the arrival of his colleagues to investigate.\nFinally, at the top of the wall, Robbie risks the torch, shielding the beam from unknown watchers with his hand, the blood in his fingers staining the light red.\nThe ridge had once been topped by teeth of broken glass, whether to keep the unwed mothers in, or the local lads out, Robbie cannot say, but enough shards remain to make his next move an unpleasant prospect.\nWhen Robbie first made the detective squad, so long ago, he thought he was on his way to financial security at last \u2013 until he realised how much of his salary would end up in mangled and junked suits. Now he shrugs off his jacket, lays it over the chipped cement and hopes for the best.\n\"Conn,\u201d he hisses into the shadows below, \u201cstay in the house with Maureen and keep the lights off. There\u2019ll be a big chap coming this way in a short while - DC Hooper. I\u2019ve sent him directions.\u201d He grins in the darkness at the thought of Hooper puffing and cursing up the ladder. \u201cAnd, next time you think you see a burglar - don't try to take them on yourself; just lock the doors and dial 999. Okay?\"\nThen he slides gingerly over the wall and drops into darkness.\nBlinding white pain courses from fibula to fingertip on impact.\n\"You alright there, Mr Lewis?\" he hears Conn faintly from the other side.\nFor a few moments, he is unable to speak coherently.\n\u201cMr Lewis?\u201d\nRobbie tests his ankle and grunts. It will ache for days to come, but will take his weight.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over, Mr Lewis \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cNo \u2013 stay where you are. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He tugs at his jacket. It comes away with the whisper of torn wool. Bugger. What he has in mind requires him to at least look respectable.\nThe generator, thumping as fast and hard as his heart, guides him through the crackle of last year\u2019s vines and leaf-fall. Knee-high grass dampens trousers and footsteps, and Robbie lungs fill with the scent of crushed leaves and hyacinth. Just as he reaches the cellar door, the moon slides from cloud cover and transforms the garden into a mosaic of black and silver dots.\nIt takes only a few seconds to locate the correct key by touch, a single iron shaft among the jumble of Conn\u2019s slippery yales, and Robbie is in, leaving the door ajar for Hooper to follow.\nMoments later, he is clutching the lintel as he catches himself on the threshold of the old laundry, the six dank steps worn slick by generations of shod feet, soap, and steam. In the narrow beam of his torch, the industrial machines loom below him, like the boilers of a long drowned liner.\nTo the left, an unlit staircase twists up and away through the annex, breathing out the ghosts of mice, mildew, dust and disuse, and perhaps a memory of milk and soiled nappies.\nIt leads him up through a maze of landings, turns and mezzanines, all odd angles and doors in the wrong places.\nIn one room, walls painted with sea creatures, whales and crabs and cheerful starfish, colours faded and splodged with damp, cracked tiles and pipes reveal the outline of long vanished showers and basins.\nIn another the ceiling has fallen, to cover stored cradles and stacked chairs with a drift of plaster like snow.\nFinally he turns to face the last door, closed and blank but for a line of fitful, flickering light escaping underneath.\nRobbie knocks, gently, and waits.\nThe door opens at last to a sliver of candle light and to a face swollen and creased, but not by sleep.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d Robbie says, and James Hathaway stands aside to let him pass into the room beyond.\n", "35": "\nChapter Text\nThe room is bare, as bleak as James\u2019s expression. Two candles, wax pooling on the worn linoleum, and a pale blanket draped bedstead, pushed against the wall. The rest of the space recedes into shadow, only the barest impression of doorways, and steps, and uninhabited echoes.\nJames is stripped to the waist, dripping, as if disturbed in the midst of plunging his head into cold water, the bones of his shoulders and ribs casting shadows in his still bruised flesh. He ducks with a wariness that Robbie identifies as shame.\nRobbie raises a hand to forestall whatever apology or attack James might be about to launch.\n\"Just listen. I know this is a bad time. I wish I could make it go away, but you have to know, and you have to make plans. The goon squad are coming through the front door at first light, with a warrant, a press release and a dozen cameras.\"\nJames doesn't waste time in outrage or protest. \"What do they have?\"\nThat's my boy, Robbie thinks, bizarrely proud. Straight to the point, concentrating on specifics, on the case.\n\"Enough. They\u2019ll get 36 hours without difficultly, maybe remand, if you're charged.\u201d\nThey, Robbie realises. Not we. For the first time since he was a rookie, in a blue collar that rubbed his neck raw, he has placed himself on the other side, among the outlaws. \u201cI called Felicity Pryor's chambers; she'll meet us at the station, try to get you out as soon as possible.\"\n\"What do they have?\" James repeats, mildly. They are both professionals, they both know that the right evidence can convict the innocent and let the guilty walk free.\nThey have you, James. The wadded paper weighs down his pocket, like guilt. They have you and your lover.\u00a0 Now Robbie is the one unable to meet the other\u2019s gaze.\n\"They have this,\" he says, holding out the folded sheet, \"from Dunn's place. You. With Meredith Waite.\"\nMeans, opportunity - motive.\nJames stares at the photo in his hand. His face is white. One hand goes to his mouth to strangle a curse. His legs fold, neatly, and he sinks onto the bed.\nAge and cancer might bow a dying man's shoulders, but once his hair had been thick and glossy, and his hands had been as broad and firm and, to Robbie\u2019s eyes, unmistakable folded on the bed sheet as they are on paper, as they were on James Hathaway's skin, a decade earlier.\nOnly now does Robbie notice the cord around looped James's wrist, knotted and tasselled, tight enough to redden and mark the flesh below. For some reason, it chills him, reminds him of stories of hair-shirts, fasting and flagellation, and he fears it.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\" Robbie says, but for what, he is not sure. For James\u2019s grief? For his intrusion into a private sorrow? Or for its thickening effect on the gulf that seems to have opened between them? Or that James had loved another and lost him.\n\"Mickey said he had evidence,\u201d James says. \u201cI wasn't sure I believed him, until now.\u201d He tugs absently at the cord, twisting it hard into his flesh. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even realised he\u2019d known.\u201d\nRobbie feels a prickle of heat, of anger or jealousy. \"At least you don't need to protect anyone but yourself now.\"\n\u201cIt was only a few weeks, a month at most. It could have destroyed him.\u201d\n\u201cYou were vulnerable, homeless --\u201d Robbie struggles to form the words against the twist in his gut, the thought of James, here, ten years ago, alone, with a guitar and no future, and the man who took him in and - took him. \"It was abuse. You know that.\"\n\"Yes. Yes, it was.\" James smiles and briefly strokes the paper. \"He didn't stand a chance. I abused my youth and freedom and his loneliness, because I could, and because I wanted him. My selfishness almost destroyed a great man. I swore never to make that mistake again.\"\n\"Christ. Come on, man!\" Robbie wants to seize James, and shake him. \u201cJust listen to \u2026\u201d He takes a deep breath. Later. Now he needs to focus on essentials, on this morning, this moment, on James. \"You know you can't be taken like this. You have to be ready. Hooper's on his way with your clothes - suit, shirts, shoes...\"\n\"Hooper?\" James asks, eyebrow raised.\n\"You're going to open the front door at five-before and walk out of here looking like a detective, not a bloody nonce! Here...\" He rips the sea-green silk tie from his pocket and tosses it into James lap. It lies there, uncoiling heavily, snake-like.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there something you've forgotten?\"\n\"We don\u2019t have time\u2026\u201d\n\"All this - and you haven't asked me.\"\n\"Asked you what?\"\n\"If I killed Michael Dunn.\"\nRobbie opens his mouth. And closes it again.\n\"Don't you want to know?\u201d James presses.\nRobbie stares at him. Both of them recognise this moment, with instinct honed by hundreds of hours of interviews; one of these sweet soft ripe moments, where some bud swells and breaks, where words flow out to surprise both interrogator and prisoner, congealing on the table between into new truths, new realities, new futures.\n\"No,\" says Robbie, and the revelation he has carried unspoken since the sunset over Fry's hill slips into the world, fully formed. The question is irrelevant. Trivial.\n\"No,\" Robbie says, and the bedsprings creak as he sits, where he can finally see James level, face to face, \"I don't need to know. I'm not here as your confessor, or your interrogator.\u201d\n\u201cAs what, then?\u201d\n\u201cA friend. I don't need an answer, because whatever you say, it can\u2019t change what I do next. I\u2019ll walk out of this place with you, step by step, whatever happens, as long and as far as I am able.\n\u201cAnd before you try it, saying something smart and mean is not going to change my mind!\u201d\n", "36": "\nChapter Text\nThere is nothing left to do now but wait.Robbie\u2019s watch is ticking. Any moment now he will speak, James will stand, and then their lives spool away into the future. But not yet.All tension, the brittle edge that has held James upright and apart for so many days, has flowed out. The man slumped beside him is boneless, in free fall, and, it seems, trusts Robbie to catch him. His eyes droop, even as the candle gutters, and the window becomes a pale rectangle of sky.\u201cThank you,\u201d James says.\u201cFor what, man?\u201d\u201cFor coming \u00a0back. Yesterday,\u201d James\u2019s eyes are open after all, watching him, \u201cwhat I said. I had no right\u2026\u201d\u201cA lot was said yesterday. Let\u2019s drop it. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re sorry. Slate clean, no need to fret over it.\u201d\u201cYou are OK?\u201d\u201c\u2019Course I am! Look, why are we talking about me?\u201d\u201cSomething you said-\u201d\u201cJust switch that big brain of yours off for a minute, will you.\u201d\u201cYou said \u2013 \u2018Robert Lewis, slept with just one person his whole life\u2019\u201d\u201cDid I? I really must learn to watch my tongue when there are detectives around.\u201d\u201cSo, you and Laura?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re both fine.\u201d Robbie looks again at the red-rimmed eyes. \u201cJames, when exactly did you last sleep?\u201d\u201cHmm. Wednesday?\u201d\u201cOh, good god, man \u2013 three nights like this? No wonder you\u2019re seeing problems that aren\u2019t there!\u201dJames closes his eyes.\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time. Still have the pills in the cabinet to show for it.\u201d He yawns, widely, like a fox. \u201cShould have borrowed Ade\u2019s when he offered.\u201d\u201cSleeping pills.\u201d\u201cYeah \u2013 everyone here ends up on them. Local GP is old school, hands them out like Smarties. The house must be rattling with them. There\u2019s coffee if you want some \u2013 nasty instant slop from Mrs P.\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tasted that already.\u201d Robbie shifts a little, just enough to allow James to fall against him, even as he carefully files the words for later analysis.\u201cLaura loves you very much,\u201d James says. \u201cThat\u2019s important. Don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201dThe weight on Robbie\u2019s shoulder is so familiar and comfortable, so precisely the memory he conjured the night before, that he\u2019s a little dizzy.\u201cCharming. James, do people generally come to you for relationship advice?\u201d\u201cNot as a rule, no. Can\u2019t think why, my own life being such a model of domestic felicitude.\u201d\u201cAh. You just haven\u2019t met the right,\u201d Robbie stumbles for a second, \u201cbloke.\u201d\u201cThat must be it.\u201d\u201cWell, what do I know? I\u2019ve been trying to make sense of this love business since before you\u2026 conjugated your first Latin noun.\u201d\u201cVerb. You conjugate verbs, not nouns. Amo, Amas, Amat\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's just-\" Robbie says. \u201cLaura's a friend. A really good mate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cAnd when it comes down to\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d\u201cIt?\u201d\u201cYeah, It. After all those years, it feels wrong somehow, like - like - oh I don\u2019t know, snogging Morse!\u201d\u201cGod, Robbie! I've no idea how snoggable the late Inspector might have been, but I really, really hope you didn't tell Laura that!\u201d\u201cJesus, man! I\u2019ve got a few problems - but I\u2019m not bloody suicidal!\u201dSomething is unsettling him, about the room. Like a forgotten gas tap or a bath left running. He needs to be moving again, thinking again. \u201cWhere's that idiot Hooper? I left the back door open for him.\u201d\u201cRobbie,\u201d James says. \u201cWill you do something for me?\u201dRobbie tears his eye from floor, from the patch of light on the floor, marking the approach of dawn. \u201c\u2019Course.\u00a0 Anything.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not bailed \u2013\u201c\u201cYou\u2019ll get bail. That\u2019s what the suit and the fancy lawyer are for.\u201d\u201cRobbie, please, if. Conditional clause. If I don\u2019t get bail, will you look after my guitar?\u201d\u201cIs that all \u2013 man, of course I will. Least I can do. Don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll bring it in for you \u2013 if you go down. You can be the Elvis of Bullingdon Category B.\u201dJames smiles. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Prisons are now guitar free paces, thanks to our enlightened Justice Secretary.\u201dAnd Robbie finally recognises, in all its specific horror, what waits for James on the far side of the front door. Like every other cop in jail, whether for days, or weeks, or years, he will be on The Rule, secluded along with the grasses, the nonces and the kiddie fiddlers, as a risk to himself and others. Twenty three hours a day on the lock. No exercise, no work, no association \u2013 and now, no parcels from the world outside, books, magazines, no carefully chosen bags of toothpaste and overpriced underpants.1And for all his bravado and his promises, Robbie can\u2019t walk beside him through that door, or hold him like this, in gaps between night and daylight.\u201cHey, don\u2019t look like that, Robbie. Trust me - prison can\u2019t be any worse than a boarding school. I survived that more or less intact, and the food has to be better. Just - keep her safe for me. Promise.\u201dHooper was right, but it wouldn't be the hard men who killed James. It would be his own lovely, fucked-up brain.\u201cI promise,\u201d Robbie says.The golden comfort of the last few moments has fled. There is just this chill half-furnished room in the dull pre-dawn light, and a puddle of wax congealing on the scuffed linoleum. Robbie shivers.\u201cOne last thing, before we\u2019re interrupted,\u201d James is smiling, head cocked to one side, like a bird considering whether to strike.It is so familiar an expression that Robbie wants to weep.\u201cDid you ever actually kiss Morse?\u201d\u201cOnce,\u201d Robbie says, finally too frayed to fall back on anything but the unvarnished truth. \u201cTo say goodbye. And thank you.\u201d2James blinks, once, seems to nod, then leans forward to brush dry, chaste lips to Robbie\u2019s cheek.Robbie\u2019s heart stops. Liquid shock runs through him, rooting in him from stem to sternum. It raises the hair on his arms, his thighs, his head, on the back of the hand which curls itself around James\u2019s skull and draws him back, close.The second kiss tastes of cigarettes, whiskey, insomnia, peppermint and the ocean, and of James\u2019s own strawberry-seeded tongue, moving against his own.James\u2019s hands are fluttering against his face. For a moment Robbie draws back in panic, heart thumping.James\u2019s eyes are huge with shock, his pupils so wide the blue almost disappears. Robbie can see a hectic tide of blood flushing upwards, chest, neck, cheeks. And then it has gone from his sight as James seizes his face in both hands and pulls him down, clutching like a drowning man plunging into the abyss.James is moving, legs, arms, tangling them together, pushing back to accommodate Robbie\u2019s weight, scrambling to pull him on top.There is an overwhelming hunger building in Robbie, to grind, to mill, to slide against and into warmth and hardness and softness and skin, and James\u2019s drawing him down, into the perfume, Yes.And his heart is going like mad and yes I said yes I will...\u201cYes.\"The solid earth crumbles beneath them both, the world swims, and they are falling together, James beneath him, floating\u00a0 over the gulf below\u2026Robbie opens his eyes again\u2026\u2026to see, beyond James\u2019s shoulder, in the first light, the blue linoleum, rippled and patterned like a city under the sea.Recognition smashes the words out of him.\u201cThese are the rooms you shared with Dunn.\u201dJames scrambles back from beneath him like a scalded cat.\u201cYes.\u201d His face is full of pain and horror, but Robbie doesn\u2019t have time to reassure him.He has seen that pattern before, at just that angle.\u201cRobbie?\u201d The confusion in his expression evaporates as he follows Robbie\u2019s thoughts and eye line, upwards, from floor to ceiling.The dawn light rakes across cracked and convoluted plaster \u2013 patterns from an earlier, more elegant age \u2013 and across a neat round hole, like an unblinking eye, from which a man might steal photographs of a couple embracing below.\n", "37": "\nChapter Text\nJames is in step with him now, absorbed by the puzzle, the satisfaction of discoveries falling into place.\nFlat, fat fluorescent lights open up room after room into a maze of unloved spaces, until they find it, in a windowless box room up a flight of six uneven steps. A hatch in the wall, half hidden by a poster for the Ashmolean, opening into the crawl space under the slates.\nRobbie kneels up on a chest of drawers to take a closer look. No further confirmation is needed - Dunn's Judas hole is betrayed by a Morse-code flicker of light from the faulty light-fitting below.\nThe beam of his torch reveals the rest - tea chests, bundled newspapers, an old pram, a celluloid doll with a crushed skull, all dusted with a seam of black soot that has been settling since the years of coal fires and steam trains. And, as he half-expected, a trail of newer, cleaner boards laid over the joists.\nHe leans in. The board beneath his knee creaks, triggering a skitter of claws in the far corner. Pigeons, he thinks, firmly. Not rats. Pigeons. Not much better, but at least not rats.\n\"Stay back. Don\u2019t trust these boards to take the weight of two.\u201d\nA few feet in, his hand sinks into something soft, tacky. A plastic pad or mattress. Not full sized, maybe a child\u2019s, but just long enough for a man to lie, curled around himself. The rafter above is padded too, with foam that crumbles at the touch. Odd that. It looks much older than it should if Mickey Dunn pinned it here ten summers ago. Perhaps the contractor who laid the lighting cables feared to bash his head as he worked.\nFighting instinctive revulsion, Robbie lays himself down, shoulder to the mattress, eye to the hole, sees flecked blue and white floating below and imagines James laid out there, under his touch. Then stops, because that image is producing an immediate and inconvenient physical response in him.\nHe turns instead to the tide-wrack of debris within arm's reach, combing the through spoil with torch-light, and comes face to face with a large and very dusty pair of swollen breasts. \u2018Milky Mums\u2019. The title, typeface, and cheap paper catapult him back to his youth in Vice. \u2018Shaven Havens\u2019 and \u2018Barely Legal\u2019 peep from the layer of dust, and, when he nudges them aside with a handkerchief wrapped finger, \u2018Gymslip Jezebels. Issue 22, September, 1992\u2019.\nSomeone's well-thumbed wank-stash, doubtless read one-handed, just like this, by torch light. Relics from the days when porn came in plain brown paper envelopes rather than a stream of digital noise. Robbie is queasily grateful for the handkerchief.\nDunn's, of course. Why not? Had he carefully carried these mags around for ten years, relieving the tensions of celibacy? Or had he found some other man's collection boxed and abandoned in a skip?\nBut something about the content doesn't match the suspect. Lying here, camera ready to intrude on an intimate exchange between James and his mentor \u2013 yet all the while brooding on big milky tits, round bellies and smooth childish thighs? It\u2019s almost as if Dunn drilled the hole like an archaeologist, hoping to uncover the ghosts of the troubled teens who had nursed their babies here long before he arrived. Unless\u2026\nRobbie\u2019s intake of breath stirs fragments of cellophane caught between the pages, little scraps of pink and red. Biscuit wrappers.\nHe recreates in imagination the man who made this haven; neat, ordered, practical, who lay here in the darkness, leafing through these pages, waiting, watching, wanking, fortifying himself with pink wafers and jammy dodgers. A man who would not be challenged as he clambered into the roof space with cables and drill to replace the lights. \"I was an electrical engineer\u2026 I helped out the sisters from time to time\u2026 that\u2019s what neighbours are for.\"\n\"James,\" he calls, as he backs out, towards the light, a copy of \u2018Udders\u2019 still clasped in his hand. \"Dunn used the hole all right. But he didn't make it. We need to have a long and meaningful talk with Conn bloody Patterson.\u201d\n", "38": "\nChapter Text\nJames's long legs quickly outpace Robbie down the annex stairs, and on across the chill grass towards the rear wall dividing St. Anthony\u2019s from the Pattersons\u2019 bungalow.It looks taller still from here, and dark, sheltered from the pre-dawn sky and even from the incongruous lights their search has left burning in the top most windows. Robbie\u2019s ankle is complaining now, and by the time he catches up, only slightly out of breath, James is already contemplating the wall separating the two gardens.\u201cYou got over here?\u201d\u201cKeep the noise down. I borrowed a ladder from the lying toerag.\u201d\"Give me a leg up.\"\"What do you think you\u2019re going to do?

Don\u2019t you?\u201dAnd Robbie does, because he can feel the wrongness of it \u2013 the sense of something out of place, out of sync. Patterson eagerness to help no longer seems neighbourly, but defensive.\u00a0\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be encouraging you,\u201d he grumbles, even as he braces his back against the brickwork, and offers his cupped hands to his partner.For a moment James flails, one long naked foot in Robbie's grasp, the other scrambling for a toe hold in the mortar, hands reaching for the top to pull himself up.\"Watch out for the glass- \" Robbie warns.\"OW! You could have said something sooner!\"\"Sorry!\" Robbie's reply is muffled by grey cotton fleece, James's borrowed sweatpants a finger's breadth from his face. He breathes in warmth, a heady scent of skin and sweat, ripe with recollection of recent desire. The proximity thrills him.Thrills them both, he quickly realises.\"Get that great thing out of my eye, Hathaway!\"\"Well, take your eyes off my great thing for a moment, and concentrate on getting me up here instead.\"James plants the other foot on Robbie\u2019s shoulder, driving the breath from his body. \"Ah, better, let\u2019s just take a look over - Oh shit.\"\"What the...? James?\" But James is already scrambling up and over, landing with a thud among Patterson's carefully tended wallflowers.\"James!\"Robbie hears nothing but a low groan. He tries to ignore the cold sweat breaking out across his back at the sound. \"Hathaway, damn it - speak to me, man!\"\u00a0\"Call for back up.\" That groan again, followed by a choked, flabby, intake of breath. \u201cIt's Hooper. Okay, big feller, take it easy. Someone's knocked him cold with - looks like a wrecking bar?\"Robbie already has the phone in his hand. \"Officer requires assistance. Rear of 13 Isis Crescent, Oscar X-ray Two. Acknowledge.\" He waits for the affirmative, confirmation that the units he knows must be parked a few streets away are alert to what is unfolding on the far side of the wall.\"Robbie \u2013 there\u2019s a light in the kitchen.\u201d\"James Hathaway, you stay with Hooper, that\u2019s an order,\" Robbie hisses, and is horrified by the note of panic in his voice. \u00a0\"The door\u2019s ajar. I\u2019m going to take a look.\u201d\u201cJames \u2013 goddamit.\u201d The phone in his hand crackles. \u201cWhat? I know you have a bloody shout on, I\u2019m in right in the middle of it. I have an officer down, medical assistance and back up required. Suspect is one Connor Patterson, IC1, male, 5 foot 8, late 60s.\u201d He cannot see, he cannot hear, he cannot know what James is walking into. \u201cDI Hathaway is the ranking officer on site. Yes, you heard me \u2013 now get those units moving.\"Robbie has lived and worked with fear for almost all his adult life, but somehow never quite this sharp or sickening. He strains to hear James\u2019s progress across the lawn, the creak of the back door. He wills the wall to dissolve and let him see James\u2019s tall shadow on the grass. But all he sees is his own, flat and faint against the brickwork.Without warning that too flickers out of existence. Robbie turns back, towards St Anthony\u2019s, just as all the lights flash on again, one last time, and die, plunging the house into darkness.\n", "39": "\nChapter Text\nThe garden and house may be in darkness, but the unseen birds of North Oxford are not fooled. They call fiercely to each other as Robbie quietly retraces his steps towards the gaping back door: me me me, mine, mine, mine. Which is how he identifies the source of the unease which has nagged at his gut since he limped across the lawn in James\u2019s wake.He hears the dawn chorus only because he can no longer hear the generator. The generator whose heartbeat has been keeping St. Anthony\u2019s alive since Patterson brought it back in the mini-van two days ago.The generator is still lying there, pungent, warm, and silent, in the right angle between house and extension, beside the open back door. Only the petrol can is missing, a little slick revealing where it stood before.The generator was silent as he and James raced past it moments ago- but the lights in James\u2019s rooms had still been burning.Someone is playing games. Someone small, and insignificant and helpful, always in the background, wandering where he wills, with his toolbox and his ingratiating smile and his thermos of coffee.\nI have been deaf and blind for so long. How could I not see this? I saw only an old man, like me, used up, settling into quiet obscurity. I couldn\u2019t see the lover in Meredith Waite \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t see the killer in Connor Patterson. \nRobbie thrusts the phone into his pocket and pauses in the threshold, among the mops and buckets and broken brooms. He listens intently for movement beyond, up or down, hearing only the softly rush of running water from the basement. I have been here before, he thinks, reeling slightly, but cannot pin down the memory of dark, flooded spaces that flees from him like a dream. He shakes it off, takes a deep breath, and steps downward into the dank bleach-scented misery of the old laundry.Patterson is at the far end, picked out in the light filtered by the tiny cobwebbed window, his back turned, scrabbling at the fuse board with little, pink, mousy paws.Robbie feels suddenly sick and deflated, as he always does at the end of the puzzle, by the meanness of it all. His skin crawls, he longs to strip the shirt from his back, scrub his skin red raw under steaming water. He thinks of Laura, washing Dunn\u2019s blood from her hands in the mortuary sink, the pink soap oozing onto porcelain.Soap. He glances down at the slimy discoloured step under his shoe. Not soap. Detergent.\nI am standing where Michael Dunn died, his skull smashed against the cement. \nNow, as his eyes adjust, Robbie can see what Patterson is about, cutting and crimping a cat\u2019s cradle of wire from the consumer board, looping it over a pipe in the wall, trailing it to a heap of junk stacked high on one of the defunct washing machines - and to the petrol can peeping from beneath. To wipe clean the evidence? Or simply to destroy this house and everything and everyone in it.Somewhere above, Robbie hears movement, splintering of wood, voices, heavy feet. Must be dawn, he thinks. He wonders how long it will take his colleagues to find them down here, but dare not move or call, or lose his line of sight on Patterson.The old man must hear it too. He pauses, head cocked, listening, one hand full of cable, the other on the mains switch, breathing hard.\u201cNot so easy, is it, Conn?\u201dPatterson\u2019s head jerks, twists, crook-backed towards him.\u201cNot like doping a cup of coffee and watching a man drink it. Or knocking a man down from behind in the dark.\u201dThe fury and malice working in the old man\u2019s face is so naked that Robbie almost reels back under the impact, feels the hair on his head rise in shock.Then Patterson smiles and nods, the mask back in place as he turns back to his work, ignoring the puddle of black water slowly spreading about his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Mr Lewis. Just fixing the lights, see?\u201d And he pulls the switch.Robbie braces himself, but nothing happens.\u201cAt six in the morning, Conn? But I suppose you\u2019re used to wandering through this house at all hours. Dunn must have worked out who made that little peep-hole upstairs. Girls\u2019 room, was it, back then, Conn?\u201d\u201cGirls? They weren\u2019t girls. Tarts. Sluts. Spreading their legs, collecting their dole cheques and breeding more scum to ruin this city. They didn\u2019t want looking after, they wanted locking up so decent people like my Maureen didn\u2019t have to hear their filth, or look at\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you looked, Conn. You wouldn\u2019t want Maureen to know that, would you? Her lying in bed, alone, helpless, while you squirrelled off to look for younger, firmer\u2026\u201d\u201cYou shut your mouth!\u201d\u201cYou must have thought it was all forgotten, all safe, \u2018til last year, when Dunn turned up out of the blue to ask for hush. Can\u2019t have been easy - not on a pension, not with a wife to look after.\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep on about my wife!\u201d\u201cBut you paid up somehow. Enough to set him up in business. That must have stung.\u201d\u201cWe had a deal.\u201d\u201cSo what went wrong on Thursday, Conn? How did Dunn end up down here with his head smashed in?\u201d\u201cHe slipped. Missed the step. Nothing to do with me.\u201dRobbie is sure he can hear sirens now, somewhere in the street, with the peculiar raspberry fart of the fire service. Who called them in? \u201cBut he could barely stand, could he? Not with all those pills in him. Don\u2019t blame you. He was a young man. Fit. I\u2019d want him groggy, too.\u201d And he wonders when Patterson first realised that a few pills in a night-time drink would render someone quiet, biddable, pliable. Exactly how much had he got away with over the years while others slept?\u201cHe asked for more, and you reached the end of your tether...\u201d\u201cHa! You don\u2019t know a thing. Your kind never do. Bleeding hearts. Soft. You don\u2019t see the way the scum take advantage. Like that nancy boy you put in here to spy on us. Bet that was a nasty shock, wasn\u2019t it, finding him AWOL, hanging out in a pansy bar with all the other perverts, eh? I\u2019m thinking you put quite a rocket under him, the way he came storming back here yesterday. But that\u2019s your problem, Mr Lewis, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. Soft. You give people like that a second chance, and they\u2019ll run rings around you. Laugh at you. You and Father Waite and the Sisters. You think there\u2019s good in folk like Dunn, and that Hathaway, and those little harlots. You need people like me to keep things straight. People who stick to the rules, who don\u2019t break their promises.\u201dRobbie realises he is no longer alone. He daren\u2019t turn around, but he can feel the presence behind him on the threshold, hear the crackle of radio, and the voices.\u201cFound them, Ma\u2019am!\u201dHe holds up his hand to signal. Quiet. Back.\u201cWhat promise did Dunn break, Conn?\u201d\u201cHe was as weak as the rest of you. Sitting there, crying, going on about his baby, and forgiveness and redemption, with his eye all blacked. Seems he\u2019d seen the light. Going to put it all right. Fair made me sick. Asked me to forgive him before he trotted off to confession upstairs. Then the police, and god knows what else. Said he\u2019d work night and day and pay back every penny, however long it took. He broke his word, see, Mr Lewis. He made a deal, and he broke it. I couldn\u2019t allow that, could I, Mr Lewis?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t have my Maureen hearing all that filth. Have them looking at me in the street and thinking they were better than me. So \u2013 I had to make him behave. I see?\u201d\u201cYes, I do,\u201d says Robbie.And he does.He sees enough and understands enough. The rest can wait for the station, for the questions already forming somewhere in his head. Later he\u2019ll tease out the details, the scraps that make a case; the phone calls, the fuses, the van, the pills, the conveniently timed power-cut. All the rags and tatters of Patterson\u2019s choices, which he was now trying to wipe away with water, petrol and a wrecking bar.\u201cYou did what you had to,\u201d Robbie says, \u201cI know that. So let me help you explain it all. We can sort it out upstairs. I\u2019ll make sure Maureen\u2019s okay.\u201dPatterson\u2019s fingers flex on the cable, and his eyes flick to the side \u2013 not to the kindling and fuel but to the loosely twisted bare wires drooping a finger\u2019s width above the rising water. A look of such triumph and spite crosses the old man\u2019s face that Robbie tastes bile in his mouth.\nDear God, James, get there fast, find her, please God \u2013 this man is an annihilator. He wants to send us all to hell ahead of him.\nRobbie takes a step down, closer to the dark slick of water. \nIf this is the last one I bring in, I want him. I want Connor Patterson. \n\u201cCome on, Conn,\u201d he says, trying to keep his voice steady, warm. Another step. Water laps the toe of his shoe. \u201cCome upstairs with me now. We\u2019ll talk, just you and me. You put the record straight.\u201d\nI want him safe and well and comfortable, sitting across a table in my nick, spilling his guts on tape. \nAnother step. Water, icy cold, splashes his sock. Robbie stretches out his hand.\nFor poor repentant Mickey Dunn, always on the wrong side of history, for Debbie and the fatherless baby making its way into the world, for Maureen who married him, for Meredith Waite who trusted him. \n\nFor James. \nPatterson shrinks back. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a smart man, an honest man. No one would blame you for what you had to do. We need you Conn. I need you.\u201d He opens his hand, palm up.\u201cI'm not afraid,\u201d says Patterson, small and fearful to the very end.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSee,\u201d says Patterson, and he opens his hand, as if mirroring Robbie.Robbie watches the heavy cable slowly uncoil and twist and fall in the dark sheet of water. He hears voices - four, five, more - crying \u201cNo!\u201d, some strange, one as familiar as his own.He feels hands reaching for him, pulling at his jacket, his shirt, hauling him back.Then he hears only thunder, and sees only white light. He feels only the breath crushed out of him, as a giant fist takes him and throws him skyward.\n", "40": "\nChapter Text\nHe is buffeted by voices:\u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStand clear-\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cChrist almighty!\u201dAnd all the time he is gasping for breath like a fish hauled up on the beach.

Not on the beach, under the sea. I am under the sea. I am drowning. See\u2026Robbie reaches up. His hand twitches, but does not move. Odd that.But, oh, James's mouth is on his, his kiss fierce and tender, and the taste of him flows into Robbie\u2019s mouth and lungs. His mouth is full of James, his eyes are full of light, his ears are full of bells; Oxford waking up to an Easter dawn. His heart swells with joy. Full. So full.Yes, he says, but goes unheard, drowned by the thump, thump, thump of a disco beat slamming into his chest.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. Not now. Not now. Please. Breathe, you stubborn\u2026 Breathe!\u201dJames must really angry with someone. \u00a0Probably me. It usually is.\u00a0He yawns. Tired now. Maybe tomorrow. \nWhere did the day get to? It\u2019s dark already. \n\nJames?\n\nNeed to sleep now. Just a little. Tomorrow. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\nPeace is rolling over him.

As far as I can tell, most of the emergency services in the Thames Valley seemed to have been patched into your Sunday morning wake-up call, plus at least a dozen members of the press. How many times do we have to tell you? Shoving a mobile into your pocket doesn\u2019t disconnect the line.

Dead on his feet, poor lamb, listening to you snore. None of us knew what to do with him. In the end, Jean reminded him she had a valid warrant with his name on, and wasn\u2019t afraid to use it: he could choose whether he slept in her cells or somewhere else, and swept him off. I promised to call them both the next time you surfaced.\u201d\n\u201cHooper?\u201d\n\u201cTen stitches in his scalp, and off home.

The bruises on his chest seem to darken in real time, blossoming blue and black over his heart.

How you doing?\"\n\"Been better,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cOh, f\u2019pete's sake, Siobhan - don't hover. Sit. Talk.\u201d His voice is stronger now, but breaks and squeaks at inopportune moments, and his ribs ache with every breath.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be taking your statement.\u201d\nHe waves that aside. \u201cI need to know \u2013 what you found.\u201d\n\u201cNot much yet. It looks like your friend Connor Patterson booby-trapped his own house, before moving onto the gothic pile. Fire brigade won\u2019t let us loose on the scene yet.\u201d\n\u201cWife?\u201d\n\"De Souza and Hathaway found her in the kitchen. They got her out, but - looks like Patterson strangled her. De Souza think she must have put up quite a fight, judging by what she saw. As for the rest, forensics are taking apart the mini-van. There is blood in the wheelchair lift. Give us a few days to match the evidence.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not looking\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026for anyone else for the Dunn killing.

You got it wrong - but so did I, and I got two people killed.\"\n\"Almost three. You\u2019d have joined them, but for Inspector Hathaway. He's an unusual man. Impressive. I understand why he raises hackles.\u201d\n\"He also makes collars.\"\n\u201cYou never doubted him, did you?\"\n\"No, \" he says.\n\"Not for a moment?\"\n\"No. Because I know him.\"\n\"And I suppose you know your boy doesn\u2019t have it in him.\"\n\"Don't be daft,\u201d He says \u201c We're all killers. In the right circumstances. Anger, fear, stupidity\u2026 Push the right buttons - we kill. No, I mean, I know him. Know what makes him tick. The very first time he spoke to me - in that God-forsaken car park, I watched him. He was relieved it wasn't suicide. That's his button.\"\n\"This hasn't been the easiest way for him to move into command, has it?\"\nRobbie sighs. \"No, it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\"Still, he\u2019s right, a fresh start will help...\"\n\"Fresh start?\"\n\"Clean slate, somewhere high profile, where he can get back on the fast track. You said he was smart.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cHathaway said that?\u201d\n\u201cHe even convinced Innocent, once he pointed out that one more transfer out of her team would unlock funding for recruitment a year early. I\u2019ll give him a good reference, too. It\u2019s the least I can do, don\u2019t you think?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\u201cMaybe your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can shake off whatever has been holding back the past seven years. Oh, and that\u2019s not the only good news. Debbie Dunn gave birth last night. Little girl. Her parents are with her, looking shell-shocked, to tell the truth.\"\n\u201cI know how they feel.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a relief to both of them when she is summoned by text back to Isis Crescent, and the smoking remains of the Patterson bungalow.\nLaura turns up at seven, with an overnight bag, a pasta salad and a single Cadbury\u2019s creme egg. - \u2018\"Seeing as you missed the Easter bunny.\"\nThey swap notes, hers on the mortal remains of Connor Patterson, his on the state of his heart, as relayed by a doctor younger than his Lyn who had looked as exhausted as he now felt.\n\u201cThese are good, Robbie,\u201d Laura looks up from her study. \u201cTrust me. According to these, your heart shows no sign of serious damage.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d he says, and he is not thinking only of the pain across his sternum.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just bruising. Nothing permanent.\u201d She brushes the hair back from his forehead, with a tenderness that makes the ache just a little worse.\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d she says. \"And so, it seems, will you. You\u2019ll be out of here in a day, two at the most. Not everyone gets a second chance, you know. Don\u2019t throw it away.\u201d\n\u201dLaura.\u201d He takes her hand before she can withdraw it, warm soft and dry in his. He has no idea what apology he can make. \u201cI\u2013 I\u2019ve never lied to you, I promise.\u201d\nHer face crumples into something halfway between grief and laughter. \u201cOh, shssh. You idiot. I know that. You seem to be constitutionally incapable of lying to anyone, except possibly yourself. Now, I have a case review first thing tomorrow morning. Should be done before lunch. Date?\u201d\n\u201cDate,\u201d he agrees.\nHerero\u2019s replacement, Nurse Jinn, seems to accept that Robbie is not about to lapse into coma, removes the last of the wires and tubes tying him to the bed, and helps him make a slow progress to the bathroom. \u201cGot to start moving, Mr. Lewis. One step at a time.\u201d\nThe night is long and lonely as only night in a building crowded with 1000 restless sleepers and dreamers can be. Robbie lies awake, contemplating silence, and wonders where James lies, if he sleeps, and what dreams or nightmares pass through his head.\nAfter seven years Robbie has learned that it is always James\u2019s silence which speaks most clearly to him. And now he is running away again.\nSoon all this will be just another anecdote in JamesHathaway\u2019s unlikely biography, revealing nothing: I rowed a bit at college; I trained as a priest; I was approached by MI5, I played with the kids on the estate. All boxed up and locked up and left behind. Safe. I once kissed my boss. \nWords spoken. Words unspoken. Sins of Omission. Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.\u2019 \nAt some point in the night Robbie slips into sleep. If he dreams, he recalls nothing when he wakes at dawn, and makes two phone calls from the bedside payphone, lying through gritted teeth on both.\n"}}, "4441751": {"Series:": ",\u00ab ,Part 27 of the ,Magic Incident Team, series", "Words:": "5023", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Jean Innocent"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Many Parts", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Relationship:": ["James Hathaway/Robert Lewis"], "Published:": "2015-08-21", "Category:": ["M/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Hits:": "291", "Kudos:": "36", "Summary": "\nRobbie has fragmented his mind after attempting to cast a charm on himself, and James is desperate to find out what happened to Robbie.

He couldn't make small talk--not here, not at this place.\nSiobhan hesitated.  \"He's not very well today.  Lots of changes.\"\nJames nodded, feeling a muscle in his jaw tense.  \"I understand.\"\n\"You might want to wait for another day,\" Siobhan said.\nJames met her eyes.  \"Have I ever waited for another day?\"\nSiobhan shook her head.  \"I expect you know where his room is by now, but I'll have Paul walk you down there.  Just in case you need him.\"\nJames couldn't imagine a situation in which Paul was going to be any bloody use to him, but he nodded all the same.\nHe could imagine that, if you didn't have someone you loved living here, this could seem a very nice place indeed.  But James could feel the weight of the charms on this place, cast to damp down the magic of the people who lived here and the charms that were afflicting them, and it felt oppressive.  It felt like a prison.\nPaul unlocked the door to Robbie's room.  \"Give us a shout if you need help.\"\nI won't, James thought, but all he said was, \"Thank you.\"\nRobbie was sitting on his bed, and at James's entry he looked up.  \"James?\"\n\"It's me,\" James said.  He'd learnt over the course of his many visits to leave it to Robbie to make the first move, to allow Robbie to act within his own comfort zone.\n\"Sweetheart.  Thank God.\"  Robbie's face flooded with relief, and he had his arms around James in a moment.  \"I didn't know where you were, and they wouldn't tell me anything.\"\n\"I'm all right,\" James said, feeling a weariness creep through him.  He'd reassured so many iterations of Robbie, and it never got any less heartbreaking.\nRobbie stood on his toes to kiss James, then whispered, \"Never mind.  You're here now.\"  Then he frowned.  \"Since when are you blond?\"\nThe trouble with Robbie's mental shifts through every conceivable version of himself was that the James Robbie remembered wasn't always the James James was.\nJames sidestepped the question.  \"Do you like it?\"\nRobbie ran a hand through James's hair experimentally, and then he smiled.  \"I think I do.\"\n\"Good,\" James said.  He longed to lean into the touch, to recapture some of the intimacy he'd once shared with Robbie, his Robbie, but it was too much of a risk.  Their bond had gone with the casting of this bloody charm, whatever it was, and it was too risky to get close to Robbie on a day he could change personas in the space of a heartbeat.  It had hurt too much the first few times for James to try again now.\nRobbie fitted his body against James's, resting his head on James's shoulder, and James couldn't help feeling the emptiness that came with the loss of their bond.  He should have been feeling whatever Robbie was feeling now.  Instead, there was nothing.\n\"I don't like this place.  I want to go home,\" Robbie said.\n\"I wish you could,\" James said, hoping his voice hadn't betrayed his emotion.  He'd tried looking after Robbie at Robbie's flat first, but it had been a disaster, one that had nearly ended with Robbie casting a very nasty charm on James when he'd thought James was a burglar.  Only James's protection charm had saved him.\nRobbie sighed.  \"Where are we?\"\n\"It's a facility for people who've been on the receiving end of charms that have gone wrong,\" James said.\nRobbie frowned up at James.  \"Who cast a charm on me?\"\n\"You did,\" James said, holding back everything else he wanted to say.  Why did you do it?  What were you trying to do?  Why didn't you tell me so I could stop you or do a counterspell that would bring you back?\n\"And it went wrong?\"\n\"It did,\" James said.  He had thought that explaining this over and over again would deaden him to the experience, but it hadn't.  It hurt every time.\nRobbie kissed him again.  \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"It's all right,\" James lied.  It would never be all right.\nA look of confusion came into Robbie's eyes, and James gently disengaged himself from Robbie so that they were no longer embracing, waiting for the next Robbie to appear.\nA wild, frenzied look came into Robbie's eyes, and James steeled himself.  Robbie threw himself at the door, pounding against it with both hands.\n\"Let me out,\" Robbie shouted.  \"Let me out!  You can't keep me here!  I want to know what I'm charged with!\"\nWhen Robbie turned from the door to survey the room, Paul slipped quietly into the room, in case Robbie got violent and James needed help.  That hurt too.  Everything hurt in this place.\nRobbie leaned against the wall, trying to get control of himself.  He glanced at James.  \"Who are you?\"\nIt cut a little deeper every time Robbie asked.  James put on his best 'policeman' face.  \"DS Hathaway, sir.\"\n\"Another policeman?\"  Sometimes that calmed Robbie; sometimes it didn't.  This time it did.  \"What did they charge you with?  They're not allowed to have us in here until they charge us with something.\"  He glared at the door.\n\"I don't think we're under arrest,\" James said.\n\"Course we are.  I know a prison when I see one,\" Robbie said.  He shuddered.  \"I hate prisons.\"\n\"So do I,\" James said quietly.\nRobbie looked at James for a moment, and then he smiled.  \"It's the copper in us, eh?\"\nJames tried to smile.  \"It must be.\"  He turned away for a moment.\n\"Something wrong, lad?\"  Robbie's voice was unbelievably kind.\n\"I miss you,\" James said.\nSilence.\nJames turned to see what had happened.\nRobbie stood there, expression faintly lost.  \"James?\"\nJames took a cautious step toward him.  \nRobbie seemed to be concentrating hard.  \"I feel peculiar.  The charm\u2026has it\u2026?\"\nThe charm.  Robbie knew about the charm.  Which meant\u2026James grabbed for Robbie's hand with clumsy, anxious fingers, and he he could almost breathe again as their bond snapped into place and he felt Robbie's confusion and disorientation.  This was his Robbie.\n\"Tell me what spell you cast,\" James said.  \"Quickly!\"\n\"I can't remember,\" Robbie said.  \n\"What did it do?\"  James said.\n\"I was meant to know everything,\" Robbie said.  \"That's what it said.  James, what happened?  I feel\u2026\"\nThe bond flickered, and James gripped Robbie's hand more tightly, trying desperately to keep the bond in place, to keep his Robbie here.  \"Stay with me.\"\nRobbie's grip tightened in response.  \"I'm trying.\"  He met James's eyes.  \"I'm sorry.  I just wanted to be clever enough for you.\"\n\"You always were,\" James said, voice breaking on the last word.\nRobbie's eyes grew vague.  \"In my head, it's all a muddle.\"  The bond flickered again, and this time, James knew it was failing.  Robbie knew too, and was frightened.  James tried to send him consolation through the bond but couldn't tell if it was working.\n\"It's all right,\" James said.  \"It will be all right.  I'll find you and bring you back.  I promise.\"  \nRobbie nodded, and then the bond broke.  James had never felt so hollow.\nRobbie pulled his hand away from James's.  \"No more lies.  Tell me the truth.\"\n\"The truth?\"\n\"Where's Val?\"  Robbie demanded.  \"What have you done with her?  Where is she?\"\nThis was the sort of scenario where James had to lie, and he didn't like it at all.  \"We're trying to find out, sir.\"\n\"Well, let me out of here and I'll help you,\" Robbie said.  He made a sudden feint toward James, trying to catch him off guard, but James was ready for him, and dodged.  Then, before James could do anything else, Paul had subdued Robbie in a tight hold to keep him from trying to get away.\n\"Don't hurt him,\" James said, voice wobbling a bit.\nBut Robbie was struggling and swearing and livid now.  \"If you've done anything with Val\u2026bloody bastards!  I'll kill you!\"\nPaul sighed, looking at James.  \"I think you'd better go.\"\nThe look in Robbie's eyes changed again, and he resumed his struggle against Paul\u2026not an angry struggle now, but a panicked struggle.  \"What are you doing?  I've done nothing wrong!\"  He turned his attention to James.  \"Please!  Don't let them do this to me!  Help me!\"\n\"I don't know how,\" James whispered.  \"I'm sorry.\"  He turned to go.\n\"Wait!\"  Robbie called behind him.  \"Please, wait!\"\nFor the first time, as James left, he wondered whether someday seeing Robbie like this would grow too unbearable for him to return.\n***\n\"You think this is helping?\"  Innocent asked from the doorway.\nJames didn't look up from the pile of papers in front of him.  \"I need to work.\"\n\"If you want to be there with Robbie\u2026\"\n\"He's not there,\" James snapped.  Then he caught himself, took a deep breath, and said more calmly, \"Being there doesn't help.\"\nInnocent entered the office.  \"How long since you've eaten?\"\n\"I'm not hungry,\" James said.\n\"That wasn't the question, but since you mention it, yes, you are.  Taking care of yourself won't stop him getting better.\"\n\"He's not getting better, ma'am,\" James said, looking up at her.  \"He's getting worse.\"\nInnocent nodded.  Apparently she'd known at least part of that already.  Sometimes it was a gift that she could see the truth of things with her magic, and that he didn't have to explain anything to her.\n\"He's on a treatment plan?\"  she asked.\n\"If you count them crossing their fingers as a treatment plan.\"\n\"That's not fair.\"\nJames sighed, closing his eyes for a minute.  She was right.  \"No.\"\nInnocent slipped into the chair on the other side of James's desk.  \"I went to see him.\"\nJames stared at her.  \"When?\"\n\"A few days ago.  I thought I might be able to see what was wrong.\"\n\"You couldn't.\"\n\"I could see it,\" Innocent said, expression grim.  \"His mind in tiny fragments, every fragment another Robbie-who-might-have-been.\"\nJames nodded.  \"That's all anyone can see, including me.  The spell was only ever in his mind, and that's exactly the part of him he's smashed to bits.\"  He turned his gaze back to the papers on his desk.  \"I've been through his flat more than once.  He didn't write anything down.  I think he\u2026\"  James's breath hitched for a moment.  \"He wanted to surprise me.\"\n\"With what?\"  Innocent asked.\n\"He wanted to be clever enough for me.\"  James didn't bother to hide his bitterness.  \"He said he wanted to know everything.\"\n\"Is that exactly what he said?\"  Innocent's voice was taut now, tense.\nJames frowned at her.  \"Yes.  I asked him what spell he used, and he said he didn't know, just that he wanted to know everything.\"\nInnocent jumped to her feet.  \"I know what he's done.\"\n\"What?  How can you?\"  James was on his feet too, work forgotten.\n\"There was a case, before he came back and before you were here\u2026Finley?  Foster?\"  Innocent thought a moment, then snapped her fingers.  \"Fenster.  Come on--we should have it in our files.\"\nMiles Fenster, it seemed, had been an undergraduate at Clare College who had favoured the illicit magical form of swotting up for his nonmagical exams.  But something had gone wrong.  He'd been found weeping behind a rosebush, half-naked, and no one who'd asked him questions had received sensible answers.\nJames pored over a list of materials that had been found in Fenster's rooms, and then he frowned.  \"He had a fifth edition Turgeon.\"\n\"Unorthodox,\" Innocent said.\nJames shook his head.  \"More than unorthodox, ma'am.  The fifth edition was the first one Turgeon didn't translate herself.  It was notoriously unreliable in the effects of its charms due to bad translations, so much so that it was taken off the market, and every copy that could be found was destroyed.\"\n\"But you would've found it in Robbie's flat, wouldn't you?\"  Innocent asked.\nJames nodded slowly.  \"If he had the whole book.  But if he only had copies of the pages he wanted, or\u2026\"  He looked at Innocent.  \"Digital photos.  I haven't checked his digital photos.\"\n\"Go on,\" Innocent said with a nod.  \"We can manage without you.\"\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"  \nFor the first time, James allowed himself to think there might be hope after all.\n***\nFinding the photos of the charm from Turgeon on Robbie's computer was easy enough.  Finding the original charms that had been translated badly was a bit harder, but thank God for the Bodleian, which had copies of the source materials, though James had to sign nearly seventy forms in triplicate promising that he would not cast any of the charms himself.\nJames set the two versions of the charm side by side, examining them thoroughly.  Strangely enough, the translation of the charm itself was dead accurate--whoever had done that work had done a very good job.  The trouble was in the definition of what the charm did; here the limits of the translator's skill showed.  What the translator had written as \"to know everything\" actually translated directly as \"to be everyone.\"  And this charm wasn't meant to be a tool of self-improvement; it was a weapon.\nRobbie had cast a charm designed to be a weapon on himself, and because he'd been the one casting it, it had ignored his protective charm and had taken effect anyway.  Bloody hell.\nNow if only there was a countercharm that could undo the damage\u2026and if there wasn't one, James suspected he could create one, given enough time.  But he hoped that wouldn't be necessary.\nHe set to work.\n***\nSiobhan gave James a look of surprise.  \"Back so soon?\"\n\"I need to ask you a favour,\" James said.\nSiobhan arched an eyebrow and waited.\n\"I need you to take the magic protections off his room,\" James said.\nSiobhan snorted.  \"Why not take them off everyone's while I'm at it?\"\n\"Please.  I think I have the countercharm for what he did to himself, and I don't have enough magic to cast it underneath all those dampening charms.\"\nSiobhan sighed.  \"You really think you can help him?\"\n\"I really do,\" James said.\nSiobhan gave him a 'I'll do it, but I'm not pleased about this' look.  \"You have fifteen minutes.  Paul will be outside the door, and if anything goes wrong, he's going to let me know and the charms go right back up.\"\n\"I understand,\" James said.\nSiobhan hesitated, then said, \"He's a bit better.  Not changing so often.  You might have a chance.\"\n\"Thank you,\" James said, setting off down the hall.\nWhen James entered Robbie's room, Robbie was sitting on the bed, with his back to the door.\n\"Robbie?\"  James said.\nRobbie turned to look at James, wide-eyed.  Then he hid his face.  \"Don't look at me, James.  Please.\"\nJames approached him.  \"Why not?\"\n\"Something's gone wrong.  I don't know how.  Shapechanging charms aren't even meant to exist.\"\nJames sat beside Robbie on the bed.  \"Someone's changed your shape?\"  This had happened once or twice before\u2026sometimes versions of Robbie expected his physical appearance to be different.  Or her physical appearance, as the case might be, because some of the versions of every-possible-Robbie were women.\nRobbie sniffled, turning away from James.  \"I don't want you to see.\"\n\"I don't have to see if you don't want me to,\" James said.  \"But how you look won't change how I feel about you.\"  He rested a gentle hand on Robbie's shoulder.\n\"It's all wrong,\" Robbie whispered.\n\"I'm sure that's how it feels,\" James said.  He could feel the protective charms being dropped around Robbie's room--he was going to have to try his countercharm very soon, to be sure that he got it all in before the dampening charms went back up.  \"But give me a few minutes, Robbie, and I'll have everything put right again.\"  Please let that be true.\nRobbie leaned back into his touch.  \"Promise?\"\n\"I promise,\" James said.  And with that, he began to speak the countercharm.\nWhen James finished, he was silent for a few moments.  Not long after that, the dampening charms on the room buzzed back into place, sounding for all the world like the hum of fluorescent lights.  James moved his hand away from Robbie's shoulder in case the countercharm hadn't worked.\nRobbie turned to face James.  James held his breath.\n\"Did you do it?  Is it me?\"  Robbie whispered.\nJames frowned at him, feeling an inner surge of anxiety.  \"You don't know?\"\n\"I don't remember exactly what I was like before the charm,\" Robbie said.  \"I've been so many different people since then.\"\n\"But you do remember casting the charm,\" James said.\nRobbie nodded.  \"Aye, I remember that.  And the fog in my mind has cleared.\"\n\"Then you must be my Robbie,\" James said.  There was an easier way to check--their bond--and with his heart in his throat, James stretched out his hand to Robbie.\nRobbie looked at James's hand for a moment, and though their bond wasn't in place yet, James could tell that Robbie was just as nervous as James was.  Robbie slipped his hand into James's, holding on tight.\nNothing.  No sign of a bond at all.\nRobbie went completely pale and dropped James's hand as though it had stung him.  \"It didn't work\u2026\"\nPrivately, James wondered about the same thing, but he certainly wasn't going to say that to Robbie.  \"We don't know that.\"\n\"The bond was there even when I was ill,\" Robbie said, getting up from the bed and beginning to pace.  \"When I broke through, whenever that was, and you took my hand, it was still there then.\"\nJames stood.  \"You see?  You remember that.  I must have brought you back if you remember that.\"\n\"I remember everything!\"  Robbie shouted, turning to face James.  \"Being the me who knew you and the me who didn't, and being the me who didn't even know me.\"  He turned away, voice growing softer.  \"The bond was going to help me be sure.  It was going to tell me.\"  He sighed.  \"I don't know who I am now.\"\nJames took a few steps toward Robbie.  \"Maybe that's why the bond isn't back yet.  Not because you're not the right Robbie, but because you're not sure.\"\n\"So it's my fault.\"  Robbie didn't sound angry when he said it, just sad.\n\"You think it's mine?\"  James asked, with more of an edge to his voice than he meant to have.\nRobbie's shoulders slumped, and he shook his head.  \"No.\"\nJames stood there silently, waiting.  If this experience had taught him anything, it had taught him to wait and see what Robbie might need before doing anything himself.\n\"Are you going to leave me here?\"  Robbie whispered.\nJames raised his eyebrows.  \"That depends.  Are you going to try to cast another coma charm on me?\"\nHe'd meant it as an attempt at humour, but Robbie drew in a sharp breath and spun to face James, his eyes deep with misery and his mouth trembling.  \"I'm\u2026I'm so sorry\u2026I've been so\u2026\"  He swallowed hard and closed his eyes, nodding.  \"You should leave me here.\"\n\"No,\" James said.  \n\"But I'm dangerous.\"\n\"I don't think you are.  You haven't changed once while we've been talking.  The charm's been lifted; the others are gone.\"  James reached out to take Robbie's hand.  Still nothing.  \"Now it's just the two of us.  And I think I can manage one of you.\"\nRobbie looked down at their joined hands.  \"How can you stand it, James?\"\n\"The bond not being there?\"  James asked.\nRobbie nodded.\nJames looked down at their hands, then back at Robbie's face.  \"Because I have to.\"  \nHe wouldn't lie; it hurt.  If the bond never came back between them, that would hurt too\u2026and James hadn't even begun to think about what sort of bondsickness one or both of them might suffer from if the bond remained destroyed.  But that was a problem for another day.\nRobbie met James's eyes and nodded his understanding.\n\"Being in your flat will be somewhere familiar,\" James said, doing his best to be reassuring.  \"And you won't have that magic-dampening stuff hanging over you all the time.\"\nRobbie almost laughed at that.  \"Dunno what it's like to you, but to me it sounds like that hum when you turn on a light at the office.\"\nJames felt a jolt of hope inside him.  \"Fluorescent lights.\"\nRobbie nodded.  \"Yeah.\"\nHe'd been touching Robbie then, when the dampening charms had come back on.  And he'd heard the same sound Robbie had heard.  In fact, he could hear it now, holding Robbie's hand.  He let go of Robbie's hand, and the sound vanished, though the damp, heavy feeling of the charm was still there.\nRobbie was studying James's face.  \"You're going to have to tell me, James.  I can't read your thoughts any more.\"\n\"You can hear the magic,\" James said.\n\"Course I can.  I always\u2026\"  Robbie's lips parted in surprise as he understood what James was suggesting.  \"I always could.\"  There was a smile in his eyes that hadn't been there before.  \"It's me, isn't it?  The real me.\"\nJames nodded.  \"It is.\"\nRobbie gave James's hand a grateful squeeze.  \"Thank you.\"  He looked around his room, pulling a face at his surroundings.  \"Think you can get me out today?  I haven't exactly got the best memories of this place.\"\nJames grinned.  \"I think Siobhan will be happy to see you go.\"\n\"Oi!\"  Robbie said.\nJames rolled his eyes.  \"You know what I mean.\"\nRobbie gave James a warm look, still holding tight to his hand.  \"I do.\"\n***\n\"There's something else,\" James said, as he was driving Robbie home to his flat.\nRobbie looked over at James, grimacing slightly.  \"Something good or something bad?\"\n\"Something interesting,\" James said.  \"When you were touching me, I could hear the dampening charm too.\"\n\"Then\u2026the bond's not gone?\" \n\"Just working differently.\"\nRobbie sighed in relief.  \"And it might go back to normal.\"\n\"It might.\"  James hoped it would, but at least they knew it hadn't been completely demolished.  Just\u2026reshaped, for now.\n\"You must feel something, though, when you touch me,\" Robbie said.  \"Since your magic works by touch and all.\"\n\"No, actually,\" James said, trying to sound nonchalant about it.  \"You seem to have\u2026blocked yourself from me in some way.\"\n\"Oh.\"  Robbie sounded deeply contrite.  \"Sorry.\"\n\"We'll just have to talk to each other more,\" James said.  He'd have to pretend it didn't bother him that his magic couldn't reveal to him the one person he actively wanted to know about.  James was sure Robbie felt guilty enough.  \"Though obviously we'll both hate that.\"\nRobbie snorted.  \"Obviously.\"  \nJames parked outside Robbie's flat, letting them both in with the key he'd taken from Robbie's things when Robbie hadn't been well.\nOnce Robbie was inside, he glanced around the flat.  \"You've had a tidy in here, haven't you?\"\n\"I had to.  You should've seen the mess I made.\"\n\"Mess you made?  When?\"\nJames gestured vaguely.  \"When I went through your things to try to find a copy of the charm you'd used.\"\n\"Ah,\" Robbie said, looking massively uncomfortable.  \"I'm\u2026so sorry, James.  I can't imagine what you must've been through.\"\nJames shrugged.  \"It's in the past now, and I'd rather not think about it.\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"What about you?\"  James asked.  \"Are you feeling more sure of yourself now?\"\n\"Still a bit shaky, but nowhere near where I was,\" Robbie said, settling onto the sofa.  \"It'll take time.\"\nJames sat beside him.  \"Can I help?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Robbie admitted.  It seemed to cost him to admit such a thing, and he reached over and tentatively took James's hand.  \"But it wouldn't hurt to try.\"\nJames stretched his arm round Robbie.  \"Come on, then.  It's been ages since we had a cuddle as ourselves.\"\n\"Yes, please,\" Robbie murmured, leaning against James's side.  He seemed exhausted.\nJames was tired too.  He'd managed to keep himself running on sheer adrenaline, but it was draining to cast such an extensive countercharm.  Now that things were more settled, James was beginning to be caught out by his own exhaustion.  James didn't have enough magic left to charm up a cup of tea at the moment\u2026but then, he didn't need to.  He only needed to rest, knowing that Robbie, his Robbie, was here, and that he had helped to bring him back.\nThe last thing he heard before he fell asleep was the infinitely comforting sound of Robbie snoring.\n*** \nJames dreamt he was in a room with no furniture and no windows.  Guitar music cascaded gently through the air, and the music sounded familiar, though James was sure he hadn't heard it before.  Oh, of course\u2026guitar music.\nEveryone with magic had, when they began using it, some sort of sign of his magic left over after he'd cast a charm.  Robbie, for instance, had found that things tended to go blue in colour when he used his magic on them.  James's magic signature hadn't been visual like Robbie's; instead, a few notes of music had seemed to hover in the air after James had cast a charm.  The music playing in this room\u2026it must be James's magic.\nFor the first time, James noticed a glass box in the centre of the room.  He took a few steps toward it, squinting at what was inside.  It looked like some sort of glowing\u2026\n\"Don't touch that!\"  Robbie interposed himself between James and the box.\n\"Why not?\"  James asked, folding his arms.\n\"It's too dangerous,\" Robbie said.\nJames looked at the box again.  It seemed to contain a glowing, sparkling blue mist.  \"You've locked your magic away?\"\n\"When I think about casting a charm, I just\u2026freeze.  All over.  And I can't breathe.\"\nJames nodded.  \"I understand.\"  He was thinking of accidentally smashed mirrors and broken windows.  \nRobbie turned to look at the box, his back to James now.  \"Every time I changed, James\u2026it was like I died.  Over and over.  Every single one of me.\"\nJames stepped forward, resting his hands lightly on Robbie's upper back.  \"I'm so sorry.\"\nRobbie shook his head.  \"Magic's not a toy.  I think I thought it was.  Even when I saw other people do stupid or terrible things with it, I thought I was cleverer than that.  I was so bloody smug.\"  \nJames took a step closer, hoping that if Robbie could feel him close by, it would help in some way.  \"And now?\"\nRobbie exhaled, head and shoulders sagging forward.  \"I don't know.\"  He turned to face James, resting his head against James's chest.  \"Tell me what to do.\"\nJames hugged Robbie tight, and Robbie returned the embrace.\n\"I think,\" James said carefully, \"that you should trust yourself the way I trust you.\"\nThere was a sudden popping noise, and suddenly, the glass box had gone and they were surrounded by the blue, glittery glow of Robbie's magic.\nRobbie inhaled sharply and tried to pull away from James.  \"No\u2026\"\n\"Wait,\" James said, catching Robbie gently by the arms.  \"Just wait.\"\nThe blue swirled around them, ferociously at first, but never touching them.  Then, the longer it spun round, the more it calmed down, until it stopped moving altogether and was simply hovering there in the air.\nRobbie stared at his magic as it floated gently around them.  \"Why does my magic sound like guitar music?\"\nJames smiled slightly.  \"That's me.\"\nRobbie looked at James, clearly delighted by something.  \"Your magic sounds like music?  You never told me.\"\nJames gave Robbie a quizzical look.  \"I didn't know it was important.\"\n\"You haven't worked it out?\"  Robbie said.  \"Your magic signature is music, and my magic works through hearing.\"\nJames laughed in surprise.  \"No, I hadn't worked it out.\"\n\"Too bad you can't touch\u2026\"  Robbie gestured vaguely to his magic.  \"\u2026blue.\"\nJames gave Robbie a mischievous look.  \"Who says you can't?\"  He reached out to Robbie's magic with one hand.\n\"James-!\"  Robbie cut off his alarmed words when he saw that the magic wasn't attacking or hurting James.\nJames ran his fingertips lightly over the surface of Robbie's magic, gently taking a handful of it.  It had the weight and texture of candy floss as it pulled away from the larger mass.  He brought his hand to rest in between them so Robbie could see the tiny, wispy sparkling fluff that sat in his hand.\n\"How did you know touching it wouldn't do something terrible?\"  Robbie asked.\nJames shrugged.  \"Because it's you.\"\nRobbie reached out to touch his own magic timidly, ready to pull back quickly if it sparked or hurt him in some way\u2026but it didn't.  So he rested his hand atop the bit of magic, with James's hand still underneath it.  All of Robbie's magic, the bit in James's hand and the swirling cloud all around them, began to glow more and more brightly, until they had to shield their eyes\u2026\n***\nJames woke suddenly, blinking, to find that they were still on the sofa.  Beside him, Robbie jumped into wakefulness as well.\n\"Bloody hell.  What was that?\"  Robbie asked, his surprise easy for James to feel.  Then he turned to look at James.  \"Say that again?\"\n\"I didn't say anything,\" James said, a slow, uncertain hope building within him.\nRobbie rested a hand on James's arm, and then looked into James's eyes, his own joy bubbling away inside him.  \"I can feel you.  But how\u2026?\"\n\"When you took your magic out of the box,\" James said, putting the pieces together, \"I think you fixed the bond.\"\n\"Yeah?\"  Robbie said, delight rushing through the bond.  Delight and\u2026and the desire to kiss James, apparently.\n\"Go on,\" James said.  \"Don't just think about it.\"\nRobbie chuckled deep in his throat and moved in for a kiss.\nThey were together this time.  Truly."}}, "4393343": {"Series:": ",\u00ab ,Part 13 of the ,A copper and his cat, series", "Words:": "4884", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Laura Hobson", "Emily the cat"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "In the end", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Text": {"1": "\nChapter Text\nSitting on the window sill with a pure look of pain Emily gave out a strangled meow when James walked down the stairs. James went over to Emily and stroked the top of her head and fussed her ear which was one of the only things that made Emily purr these days.Emily looked up at James as if she was trying to say please don\u2019t go.James looked at Emily sadly. Emily had not been at her best lately, she was only eating very small bits of her food and that was only if James was lucky. Her walking was now complete limping with little control over her legs; the worst part of it was that she couldn\u2019t control her bladder and the fact that she was drinking waterfalls of water everyday as if she needed it to keep herself happy or at least the happiest Emily could manage.James\u2019s mood had not been any better; nowadays he was always snappy and miserable. James\u2019s mood had been especially noticeable at work, even Emily would have noticed his bad mood if she wasn\u2019t in so much pain.James took one last look at Emily who was now limping over to the sofa, she attempted to jump up but her legs had now given way so James had to pick her up, which of course earnt him a severely angry hiss.Before leaving James tried to give Emily a small smile, but her loud painful meow made James fail his attempt which had left him feeling worse by the time he had got to work.__________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0In the office James was buried in paper work while Robbie kept watching James as seemed to be getting frustrated at the fact that he was dealing with paperwork, instead of looking after Emily and absorbing all the time that she had left.Robbie hated working in silence especially if there was a bit of tension in the atmosphere.\u201cWould you like a coffee James\u201d? Robbie offered.The frustration that had built up on James\u2019s facial expression seemed to mellow at the polite offering.\u201cPlease sir\u201d James replied quietly.When Robbie had returned with two coffees the atmosphere in the room hadn\u2019t changed. While placing the coffee in front of James the question of how Emily was doing was blurted out of Robbie\u2019s mouth, he was instantly kicking himself mentally.\u201cFine sir\u201d was James\u2019s grumbled reply.Surely James must have known that Robbie knows him better than that. Fine could mean anything from she\u2019s ok to she is expected to rest in peace any minute.Robbie was about to reply to James\u2019s answer when he was interrupted by Dr Hobson.\u201cMorning Robbie, morning James\u201d Laura said in her usual tone.\u201cMorning Laura\u201d Robbie replied while giving her a small smile. It soon disappeared when James had mumbled his good morning.\u201cRobbie can I talk to you for a minute\u201d Laura said quietly. Robbie followed her out of the room, unnoticed by James who still had his attention focused on the paperwork.Laura closed the office door and stood in front him as she spoke to him.\u201cIs he still worrying about Emily\u201d? Laura asked as well as looking around as if to see if anyone was listening.\u201cHe thinks I haven\u2019t noticed but I can tell when something is really eating at the lad\u201d Robbie said sadly.Laura sighed. \u201cLosing someone important to you isn\u2019t easy\u201d. Robbie knew that too well.\u201cAye I just wish I could help make the suffering a little easier you know\u201d Robbie said almost in a whisper.\u201cPerhaps I could go round to Hathaway\u2019s this lunchtime and check on Emily for him\u201d Laura suggested.Robbie repeated Laura\u2019s words in his head before replying. \u201cI suppose you could give it a go, it might help James to worry just that bit less if he knew someone was with her\u201dHaving decided on a plan Laura and Robbie went back into the office, this time James did notice them.\u201cJames\u201d Laura began. \u201cI just wanted you to know that I\u2019m free this lunchtime, so if you like I could visit Emily quickly to see how she is getting on\u201d Laura said kindly.James\u2019s eyes snapped up at her as his brain and ears were processing what he had just heard. James felt his heart sink at the fact that Laura cared so much that she was willing to give up her lunch break to do him a favor. He could also hear the little voice in his brain say look you have been giving yourself a hard time over not being able to check on Emily throughout the day, now your friend is asking to do you a favor.James then decided to stop being the stubborn sod he is and let Laura help him.\u201cThank you Laura that would be helpful\u201d James said softly as he ducked his head.James gave Laura his spare keys and when their lunch break came along Laura drove off to Hathaway\u2019s._________________________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile at James\u2019s house Emily was lying on the sofa completely exhausted. She meowed in pain when she stretched her legs across the sofa.Being bored of sitting around and doing nothing Emily tried to stand up but ended up falling off the sofa. She cleaned herself to get rid of the dirt her fur may have picked up during the fall.As Emily tried to get up for the second time she felt her legs wanting to give way , her eyes drooping slightly and her breath being more limited. At that moment was the moment when Emily decided that she wanted to go out to the garden as she didn\u2019t go there as much since her body had become old and pain ridden.Despite feeling the need for water she staggered into the garden and slumped near the tree, remembering all the adventures she had up there when she was that young cat she was desperate to be again.Emily slowly looked around the garden as if she was trapped in a place she didn\u2019t know .A bird flew down and tweeted at her several times but Emily didn\u2019t have the energy to chase it and eventually the bird flew away. Emily looked up at the sky wishing that she was able to chase birds without thinking about the amount of energy she needed.Suddenly she was shaken from the thoughts as her chest felt tighter and she felt her muscles become numb and completely useless.Emily laid her head gently on the grass  where she remembered her first memory of being in the garden with James. She vividly remembered James cooking food on the barbecue and him giving her a bit of cooked chicken as extra dinner, Emily looked as if she was smiling at the happy memory . Her memory was soon cut short when her chest felt more tighter than before which caused her to wheeze. Knowing what was about to happen Emily\u2019s final thought was James I hope you will one day realise how much you are loved.With that Emily felt herself stop breathing, her eyes drooping until they were closed and everything in Emily\u2019s vision suddenly went blurry until it went pitch black.______________________________________________________________________\u00a0It was pouring with rain as Laura drove to Hathaway\u2019s. James had told Laura that she would need to fill up Emily\u2019s water bowl as she drinks a lot more than she used to.She also remembered James telling her that Emily didn\u2019t like to be touched , James had shown her the long scratch mark that Emily had given him the last time he picked her up to help her get on to his bed.When Laura had parked her car she unlocked the door to be welcomed by silence and no sign of Emily.Laura noticed that the water bowl was nearly empty; she went over to the sink to fill up the water bowl. She left it in the living room as that was where Emily was most likely to be.After waiting for over fifteen minutes for Emily to make an appearance, she went to look for her just in case she was finding it difficult to come to her.Laura went upstairs and searched in James\u2019s bedroom, the bathroom and toilet but Emily was nowhere to be seen.\u201cWhere is she\u201d Laura said to herself as she went back downstairs. Laura then saw the garden door open, Laura soon went to the garden despite the heavy rain and she soon saw Emily lying near the tree.\u201cWhat you doing their puss\u201d Laura said gently. When Emily didn\u2019t move or make a sound Laura began to worry.Laura crouched down beside Emily and slowly touched her body. When she didn\u2019t react Laura felt her body temperature, Emily was stone cold.Laura immediately stood up, her heart was racing. For a minute all Laura could do was stare at Emily until she got her mobile and rang Robbie.At the office Robbie\u2019s mobile was ringing and he walked out of the office to answer the call.\u201cHello Laura is Emily alright\u201d? Robbie asked.Laura was clearly shaken as she spoke. \u201cRobbie, I found Emily in the garden and\u201d...\u201cLaura\u201d? Robbie asked, concern starting to show in his voice.\u201cRobbie she\u2019s dead, I was looking for her everywhere and when I went up to touch her she didn\u2019t react plus her body is stone cold\u201d Laura said shock and panic taking over her voice.Robbie rubbed his eye and sighed heavily before speaking \u201cOh bloody hell, what am I going to tell James\u201d?\u201cHe\u2019s going to find out sooner or later\u201d Laura said gently. \u201cShould I tell him the bad news\u201d? Laura asked.\u201cNo I will\u201d Robbie replied. Then he added \u201cif anyone is going to tell James any heart breaking news then it should be me\u201d.\u201cAre you sure\u201d? Laura asked softly.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s best if it comes from me\u201d Robbie said sadly.Robbie looked into the office window and saw that James had nearly finished the paperwork.\u201cWont James want to go home when you tell him\u201d? Laura asked softly.\u201cI suppose so, he will want to go home and he will want to be alone\u201d Robbie said.\u201cRobbie you know that it\u2019s not always good to be alone after something as life changing as death\u201d. Robbie repeated Laura\u2019s words in his head and he realised that Laura was right.\u201cYour right, the lad had been alone for far too long before he got Emily and I don\u2019t want him to be living like that again\u201d.Once they had ended the call they had planned to meet at James\u2019s house with James. Laura had found a phone number for the local vet and told the vet about Emily\u2019s death.Robbie stepped back into the office, preparing himself to tell James the bad news.\u201cJames, I need to tell you something\u201d Robbie said quietly while sitting down on a chair and wheeling the chair next to James.\u201cSir\u201d? James questioned.You\u2019re not going to like what I have got to say lad, was the thought that was going through Robbie\u2019s mind.Robbie rubbed his eye before speaking. \u201cJames when Laura went round, she found Emily in the garden \u201cRobbie started awkwardly.James looked up at him waiting for him to continue.Robbie sighed. \u201cLaura found her dead James, I\u2019m sorry lad\u201d Robbie said as softly as he could.James felt his blood run cold as soon as he heard Robbie\u2019s sentence. He then ducked his head and clasped his hands as if he was trying to block out Robbie\u2019s words.Robbie eventually stood up and told James that Laura was waiting for them both at his house. James soon followed him and he didn\u2019t say a word for the whole journey to his house.Laura met both of the men at the garden when they had arrived. Laura and Robbie were stood near Emily\u2019s body while James was stood behind the back door staring at the floor.Robbie and Laura were talking quietly to themselves, not wanting to disturb James from his silence.\u201cSo, how long do you think Emily has been you know... dead for\u201d? Robbie asked while looking at James in case he had heard him ask.\u201cI would say she has been dead for at least a couple of hours\u201d Laura replied, she too was looking at James, in fear of upsetting him more than he already was.Unknown to Laura and Robbie James had overheard their conversation.\u201cSo she would have died a couple of hours after I had left for work\u201d! James said with a hint of anger.His question had startled both Robbie and Laura before answering with a look of sorrow. \u201cYes \u201cLaura said quietly.James leaned his head back and chewed on his thumb as if he was trying to stop himself from crying.Suddenly the church bells nearby began to ring, the sound of the bells made all of them go silent. Even though the bells were creating a peaceful sound, James just looked irritated.\u201cBloody bells \u201c! James said bitterly, before adding with all anger vanished \u201cI should have stayed with her\u201d. It was going to be like the Vicki incident all over again.  Without saying another word he went back inside to the living room and sat on the sofa with his head in his hands.\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\nThe very next hour Robbie and Laura came into the living room, both feeling sympathy as well as being concerned about his health.Robbie sat down on the sofa next to him, not wanting to sit on the left side where Emily used to sit. Laura remained standing; they were all silent as none of them knew how to break the silence.After a few more minutes Laura looked at both men before saying in a sympathetic tone \u201cI called the vet earlier today and she told me a few options of how you could have Emily buried\u201d.James\u2019s head snapped up at Laura, \u201cWhat are my options?\u201d James said miserably.Laura let out a small sigh before speaking \u201cyou can have Emily cremated which your vet said was the best option, she also said if you would prefer you could -\u201d.James rubbed his eyes before replying to Laura \u201cI really don\u2019t want to go through a list of options now , I will just stick with cremation\u201d\u201cOkay, where do you want to bury her?\u201d Laura asked kindly.James stared at the floor, while Robbie put an arm around James to encourage him to speak.It was James\u2019s turn to sigh, \u201cI want her buried here\u201d he said quickly before turning his stare to the garden.After a while longer Laura and Robbie along with the vet they had called after their little conversation had removed Emily\u2019s body, all James did was stare at the floor , not daring to watch them take away one of things that had meant the world to him.Much later that evening James was still sat on the very same spot on the sofa, staring at the other side of the sofa which Emily would usually be curled up on.James\u2019s blank eyes noticed the little strands of cat fur that remained on the left side of the sofa, not wanting to touch it as it was the only thing that James now had to remind him of the friend who used to wipe away the miseries of everyday life.James leaned his head back while breathing heavily to stop the tears that were stinging his eyes from falling.James kept his gaze at the left side of the sofa as if he was imagining Emily there, brushing away his tears of remorse in her own comforting ways.Before going up the stairs to bed, James took one last look behind him, wishing that Emily was there to follow him to the stairs and meow at him as if to say goodnight.James certainly hadn\u2019t planned on Yesterdays goodnight meow from Emily to be her last.___________________________________________________________________________\u00a0Waking up on the following day had been a difficult task for James, for a moment he had called half of Emily\u2019s name before regretting and remembering that Emily was no longer around to say good morning too.Getting lost in his sorrow James had nearly forgotten that he was put on a week\u2019s leave, which was just as well as James had drunk a lot more than he should have the previous night. It was as if alcohol was the only solution to the emotional pain that was haunting him.Stumbling down the stairs, a massive headache drew James away from his thoughts for just a second before they all came scrambling in again, darkening and overcrowding James\u2019s overworking brain.James looked around the living room as if he didn\u2019t recognise or even belong there anymore. He felt a huge twisting and turning sensation in his stomach knowing the fact that his flat now felt empty without Emily.The atmosphere in the house was wiped out by silence; there were no sounds of pattering paws coming down the stairs or any meows that were loud enough for the whole street to hear. Hit by the sudden realization that all of Emily\u2019s things were dotted all over the flat, had made James tense up and be reminded that those days where James had been desolate in his own misery and loneliness had now come back to slap him round the face.James\u2019s body language was almost screaming out I need you Robbie! Even if he wasn\u2019t aware that he did actually need him.Meanwhile at the office Robbie sat alone with only his paperwork for company,that soon changed when Laura entered unexpectedly.\u201cDo you think that James should be on his own tonight\u201d? Laura asked, her voice filled with nothing but pure concern.Robbie sighed heavily, \u201cTo be honest no, he has been alone for far too long for most of his life before he got Emily\u201d.Laura nodded in understanding; she knew that Robbie would go over to see how James was even if he didn\u2019t let on that he was going to. She also knew for a fact that Robbie cared a lot for the lad and she had always believed that Robbie has wanted James to be more than a work colleague or a friend for a large amount of time.Later that day Robbie had decided to take Laura's advice and go see James. If he was honest with himself he knew that James would be more than happy to see Robbie at his door step, offering the comfort that now no one else could provide.While Robbie was driving over to James\u2019s, James was sat on one side of the sofa, running a finger on a toy mouse he got Emily when she was a kitten.James nearly jumped out of his seat when he heard an unexpected knock at the door. Letting out a heavy sigh he got up slowly to answer the door.His eyes widened in surprise and maybe even in relief to find that it was Robbie who was standing on his door step.\u201cSir\u201d? James asked quietly while rubbing his eye.\u201cMay I come in lad\u201d? Robbie asked gently.All Robbie got in response was a nod from James.Robbie then followed James into the living room to be welcomed by the stench of cigarettes and the many empty bottles which were scattered around the coffee table and the kitchen desk top.Robbie then noticed the full wine bottle that was perched on the side of the sofa that Emily used to sit on. Before James could even protest, Robbie took the bottle and poured the alcohol down the kitchen sink.\u201cIt\u2019s for the best lad, I wish I had someone do this for me when Val died\u201d Robbie said kindly.\u201cI was trying to convince myself that I wouldn\u2019t drink it tonight\u201d James revealed.\u201cAye, I did the same but I never quite managed to keep to that promise\u201d Robbie replied kind heartedly.Knowing that the conversation wasn\u2019t going to go any further Robbie sat himself down on the brown leather chair, not wanting to sit on Emily\u2019s part of the sofa just in case James found it disrespectful.The two men sat in silence for the majority of ten minutes before Robbie broke the silence.\u201cYou know Alcohol isn\u2019t the cure to all your troubles James\u201d Robbie said.\u201cIt\u2019s the only cure I\u2019ve ever known\u201d James retorted.Robbie sighed before speaking, \u201cI know how you feel, alcohol was my only friend in the first year after Val died\u201d. Robbie cleared his throat before continuing, \u201cThen it became my best friend in the second year\u201d Robbie admitted.James looked up at Robbie, admiring that he could admit something that personal.James was about to speak until Robbie had got there first, \u201cListen lad don\u2019t be like me because in then end the alcohol treatment did no good for me what so ever and I won\u2019t let it destroy you\u201d.James ducked his head down as he listened to Robbie\u2019s words and saw that his words made perfect sense as they always did.Robbie then walked up to James and sat right beside him, being careful of not invading the space that was once occupied by Emily.He then placed a hand on James\u2019s shoulder before speaking softly to him, \u201canother thing I was without for an amount of time was someone to talk to about my feelings, I mean I had Lyn but it was my job to comfort her not the other way round\u201d.James felt a sharp ache in his chest as Robbie was speaking to him, wishing that his father had been a kind and understanding person like Robbie.\u201cI know that you haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about how you feel so I\u2019m offering you a chance to tell me\u201d Robbie said, his voice still gentle.James cleared his throat before replying in a shaky voice, \u201cRobbie I don\u2019t know how to put this but you\u2019re wrong about me not explaining my feelings to anyone\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir\u201d James added in embarrassment.In truth Robbie was a bit surprised at what James had just said even if he didn\u2019t show it.Instead Robbie simply said, \u201cTell me\u201d in his kind hearted way.James looked up at Robbie for a second before explaining himself, \u201cEmily was the one I discussed my feelings too and I know this sounds stupid but it felt like she understood what I was telling her even though she couldn\u2019t say anything back\u201d.James then paused as if he was mortified about what he had just let out of his own mouth.\u201cCarry on \u201cRobbie said in an encouraging tone.\u201cThis is going to sound even more stupid but Emily wasn\u2019t just a pet... she was a friend\u201d James stammered awkwardly.All Robbie did was look at James, his eyes showing full understanding of what James was telling him. However he had not expected to hear the following words that came tumbling out of James\u2019s mouth.\u201cEven though it made me feel a bit better telling her my troubles I sometimes got the feeling that I was somehow taking advantage of her\u201d James said in his low voice.\u201cHow do you mean lad\u201d? Robbie asked his voice as gentle as it had always been.James sighed quietly, \u201cI mean I just bombarded all my problems and issues on to an innocent cat who quite frankly didn\u2019t deserve to have all my troubles just thrown at her\u201d James coughed before speaking again, \u201cI guess I was so frightened of feeling alone in my misery that I just got used to talking to Emily\u201d.Robbie gave him a look which said, oh lad you could have come to me, no you should have come to me.James\u2019s last sentence was, \u201cNow that I have lost Emily all my past worries and loneliness have come back to bite me on the behind\u201d James spat.It was at that moment when Robbie realised that Emily hadn\u2019t just made James happy she had also helped James to deal with his emotions other than turning to alcohol. However in the last couple of days that had all changed which Robbie was determined to change permanently.Robbie could also see that James was on the verge of tears which James was desperately trying to gain control of.\u201cJames I-\u201cRobbie began until he was cut off by James\u2019s interruption, \u201cOne thing I forgot to add was even though I knew she couldn\u2019t talk, I could get that feeling in my chest that Emily truly cared about me\u201d.Robbie gave James a look of sympathy before blurting out in almost a whisper, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a cat to show you that you're cherished\u201d. Robbie then added in the same tone, \u201cCome here lad\u201d as well as stretching out his arms wanting to embrace James in a hugJames could deny it no longer; he has needed that hug for so long that he had convinced himself that he could get past his problems on his own and now because of Robbie he suddenly realised that he no longer had to think or feel that way.The tears that had threatened to spill had carried out the threat as a few tears rolled down his cheeks. Robbie than grabbed him lightly and gave him that hug that James had needed, no wanted for many years.Once James had stopped sobbing and spilling tears, Robbie passed him a tissue which got a whispered thank you in response.As James wiped his eyes and blew his nose Robbie said, \u201cYou know lad you don\u2019t have to be alone anymore\u201d.James gave him a puzzled look so Robbie continued.\u201cI\u2019ve seen how you put on this suit of Armour and pretend that nothing bothers you when clearly its eating at you\u201d.Robbie\u2019s sentence had startled James however his facial expression gave the impression that he didn\u2019t understand what Robbie was trying to tell him.Robbie then explained in detail.\u201cJames I\u2019m basically saying that its pains me deeply to see you shove your emotions right down to the bottom of your mind then expecting myself and Laura to not suspect that something is wrong and the worst part of it is that you don\u2019t seem to know how valued you are , not just by those at work but by me.James knew that it was his turn to listen.\u201cYou have helped me through some difficult times and I know for a fact that you\u2019re the best mate I have had in many years\u201d Robbie coughed awkwardly before continuing, \u201cAs my best mate I want you to be happy and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you\u201d Robbie finished, letting out a deep breath as if he had been holding it in for years.James looked flattered at what Robbie had just said to him as he had never considered how his own misery could affect the other people who show compassion and respect for him. At the sudden realisation it made James\u2019s head hurt at the thought of what Robbie and even Laura have been through in his times of misery and hurt.James was about to say something that he should have said years ago.\u201cRobbie, I had never considered what you and Laura have put yourselves through in my bad times and I just want you to know that I am grateful of what you and Laura have done for me in the past few years\u201d. James scratched his head before finishing off his sentence, \"and for that I thank you\".The two men sat in silence for just over two minutes when Robbie unexpectedly said, \u201cI tell you what lad why don\u2019t you have a fresh start\u201d.\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d? James asked almost nervous of what Robbie was about to say.\u201cI mean why not put your worries at rest and say close the door to loneliness and open the door which leads to you spending your life away from the fear of being alone and enjoy the part of life that shows you the true beauties of what the goods things bring\u201d.For the first time in ages James let a small smile spread across his lips in delight. Robbie saw the pure joy and peacefulness the smile contributed into the atmosphere of the room.\u201cI think that sounds like an excellent idea\u201d James said in agreement to Robbie\u2019s words._______________________________________________________________________________Over the next few days James was more than pleased that Robbie had agreed to stay at his flat for a few nights which James had to admit made him feel better about the loss of Emily but also it had helped the fears of being alone shrink until they were no longer bringing despair to James\u2019s mind.Now that was something that Emily could never have provided on her own.If Emily was able to see James right now her thought would definitely have been something along the lines of, in life everyone gets what they deserve and James deserves all the love and care that is possible for one man to receive.\n"}, "Published:": "2015-08-19", "Category:": ["M/M"], "Archive Warning:": ["No Archive Warnings Apply"], "Hits:": "242", "Kudos:": "21", "Summary": "\nWhen James is at work an unexpected yet shocking event occurs, this leaves him questioning everything.\n", "Additional Tags:": ["Emotional Hurt/Comfort", "bad times", "Character Death"], "Comments:": "14", "Authors": ["RickardoTheAvacardo"], "Chapters:": "2/2", "Language:": "English", "Completed:": "2015-08-19"}, "4429883": {"Chapters:": "27/?", "Words:": "40952", "Characters:": ["James Hathaway", "Robert Lewis", "Jean Innocent", "Laura Hobson", "Original Characters"], "Fandom:": ["Lewis (TV)"], "Title": "Snippets Of Life", "Rating:": ["Teen And Up Audiences"], "Text": {"1": "\nChapter Text\nThe man grins and launches himself at the two policemen. They've been stuck in this basemment for four hours now and they are both stiff, tired and hungry. James Hathaway looks over at his boss, who nods and they both stand their ground. Backed up against the wall, the suspects panics and pulls a baseball bat out of nowhere. James and Lewis back of warily, exchanging looks with each other. It is during one of these looks that the man lunges, grabbing the inspector and smiling infuriatingly at the young sergeant.\u201cYou back off now son. Over that side of the cell. And sit down, otherwise I'll club him.\u201d Seething, James retreats to where be has been told. The man grins evilly. \u201cGood boy. Although, you know I might just do it anyway\u201d He brings the baseball bat down on Lewis' unprotected head, it glances off and Lewis crumples to the floor.\u201cBastard.\u201d James spat as he got up.\u201cYou want some of the same son?\u201d James just growls as he leaps at the man, he punches him in the face and the scuffle continues. Eventually the attacker realises that this young cop's anger is keeping him going and sooner or later the tall man is gong to win. He deals James a stunning blow that sends him sprawling to the floor. He leaves the room immediately and doesn't see the younger man crawl over to his boss. He's misread this situation. He took the quiet tones and sarcastic wit of James to be dislike of his boss. He can't conceive that the man may in fact be displaying fierce loyalty.\u201cSir?\u201d Nothing. James glares at the door and sits down to wait for his boss to wake up. His chest is heaving with exertion. His face hurts a little but the pain brings immense satisfaction, he knows that he gave as good as he got. He gently feels the back of Lewis' head. There is a little bit of blood there, but it doesn't seem too serious. He sits there for another half an hour, and dozes off\u00a0******************************************\u00a0An hour later, he is awakened by pressure on his shoulder. Opening his eyes, he smiles as he sees his inspector sat beside him.\u201cHow're you feeling sir?\u201d\u201cBeen better James.\u201d He winces but it is apparent to James that his boss is in no immediate danger. It is silent for a time and then Lewis speaks.\u201cJames, what happened to your knuckles?\u201d James looks confused and glances down.\u201cOh. Yeah that. Er, I, that is me and our captor had a little disagreement sir.\u201d\u201cOh? You kids should learn to play nice. What was this little disagreement about then?\u201d Hathaway had the good grace to look slightly embarrassed.\u201cActually sir, I didn't like the way he tried to smash your head in.\u201d Lewis saw it now. Those weren't defence wounds like he had first thought. He saw them for what they were. Grazes on the knuckles cause by beating a person in anger. He had a pretty good idea how his sergeant had reacted to him being smashed over the head. He felt a small swell of pride that his sergeant cared that deeply for him, that the normally quiet man would react in so aggressive a way for him. He also had another thought. One he has voiced before.\u201cJames, I must admit, sometimes I'm bloody glad you're on our side.\u201d James hears his veiled thank you and just grins.\u00a0\n", "2": "\nChapter Text\nRobbie Lewis groaned as he got out the car. It was wet, it was cold and it was Monday morning. Early Monday morning. Obscenely early, six am was not the time that a 60 year old man should have to wake up. None of these things had a positive effect on his mood. As he looked up, he realised that the last possible thing to make his day worse was coming towards him. It wasn't that he and his sergeant didn't get on. It wasn't that, they got on very well except when Hathaway's personal motives and secrets messed up a case. And they'd sorted that out now anyway. No, the problem today, was that his sergeant looked unbelievably cheerful. And when James Hathaway was cheerful, it invariably meant he was going to be annoying.\"Good morning sir.\" The light, airy tone was already grating on Lewis' nerves.\"Is it? It's a freezing, damp Monday morning and we've got a body. What's so bloody good about it James?\" Hathaway smirked in that way the Lewis just knew, meant he was going to come out with some sarky comment. \"Don't say a word. Just don't.\" If James wasn't the sort of guy he was, he'd have just kept going. But he wasn't that sort of bloke. He knew when he was pushing it and when that pushing it would be tolerated by the older man. Today wasn't one of those days. He ducked his head under a branch as they walked towards the site of the crime. Lewis shuddered involuntarily, Wytham Woods always gave him the shivers. Well being dragged in there and made to dig your own grave was bound to leave some ill feeling about a place wasn't it? He was aware that James was actually being quiet and turned to survey the man.\"Well, what have we got then?\"\"Dog walker found a skeleton. Reported it in and since Grainger is on that murder case in the vicarage, it got given to us. Hobson's on her way\" Lewis smiled. Laura Hobson was a good friend and well, she weren't bad looking either.They stood by the scene, and saw what looked like a snapped leg bone sticking out of the soil. James was looking very pensive and it worried the old inspector some what. He knew what the younger man was thinking about. The Zelinsky case. James had been the one to find her, the 10 year old that Zelinsky had murdered and he hadn't taken it well. Looking at the size of this bone it looked like he may well be having to watch his sergeant a lot more closely this case. It started to drizzle. Then shower. Then bucket down. Both detectives were wet through and even James' exuberant expression had disappeared, to be replaced with sour discontentment.At last, Hobson's car turned up and she climbed out, already suited in the customary blue jumpsuit that forensic pathologists were supposed to wear. Eyeing them both, she decided that today was not the day to be making jokes. James excused himself and went to meet a constable carrying styrofoam cups of cardboard-like coffee. Once he'd gone, Laura turned to Lewis.\"What's eating him? Not our usual bundle of joy today is he?\"\"That Laura, is because, like me, he's been stuck in a rainy forest for two hours.\" As she assumed an affronted expression he hurriedly continued. \"That and we think it's a young body. Well he's not even fully over Zelinsky yet is he?\" She nodded sympathetically.\"Ah. Best keep him away from this then.\"\"No good. He'll just get annoyed. Doesn't like anyone trying to help him out does he?\" They were both quiet as Hathaway returned balancing 3 cups of the meant-to-be coffee in the crook of his arm. Hobson shook her head.\"None for me until I've examined this body.\" She looked pointedly at Lewis. \"No need for you two yet. I'll tell you when I know something.\" Lewis nodded, no need to make James watch if they were indeed going to find a young victim.After much grumbling by the two police men about tine wasting and the absolute failure of British weather, Dr Hobson emerged from the trees.\"Want the good news or the bad news first?\"\"Good news\" James and Lewis said simultaneously\"The good news is that we're not dealing with a child here\" James visibly relaxed.\"And the bad news?\" He asked in trepidation. Laura looked from one to the other.\"You won't kill me?\" They both assured her that they wouldn't.\"...It's a dog.\"\"A DOG?!?!\" James exclaimed. Lewis looked at her in disbelief.\"You mean, we've been stood out here since half six...?\" Hathaway saw the warning signs that Lewis was about to explode in anger. He grabbed his arm and started to drag him back to the car, tossing a 'Thank you doctor' over his shoulder to Laura. Who, for her part, was doing her best not to laugh. As he got into the car he saw Lewis' reddening face and held up his hand to silence any violent out burst.\"I think you could do with a pint sir.\"\"Its half 8 in the morning sergeant. No where will be open. \"\"Ah sir don't worry about that. I happen to have a very well stocked fridge\" Smirking at the almost pleading look on Robbie's face, he quickly drove off in the direction of home.\u00a0\n", "3": "\nChapter Text\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cJust taking a breather\u201d\n\u201cAny luck?\u201d\n\u201cI know what you're thinking. But you're wrong. He left something. He left something for me to find or else...Why send me that letter?\u201d\n\u201cSir...Let it go. You've been through every shred of paper, every word, every file, every photo\u201d\n\u201cThen we, keep looking!\u201d\n\u201cNo! I'm not going to stand by an watch you do this to yourself. You know I'm not. There is nothing here about your wife! Let it go!\u201d\n\u201cHow can I? Its in my head now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn that moment, what James had seen had frightened him more that he'd care to admit. He'd seen something alien in Lewis' eyes. A type of vulnerability that shocked him to his core. The man had always seemed to be a rock to him. Whenever he went off course, whenever he screwed up, Lewis was there for him. Knowing what to say, how to bring him back. And James desperately wanted to be the same for his inspector. He wanted to be able to reciprocate the support he was given, but he didn't know how. The words wouldn't come. As Lewis went back to his fruitless, desperate search, James turned away. He couldn't bear the pain in Lewis' eyes and he wanted nothing more than to run from the room, put some loud, fast music on and go back to work the next day to a Lewis that was back to his normal self. But he didn't run. He'd never have forgiven himself. He didn't have the words, that was true, but he had himself. Shrugging off his jacket, he crouched down to the mass of papers littering the floor. He began to read.\n\u00a0\n**************************************\n\u00a0\nThree hours later and James rocked back on his heels, landing on the floor slightly harder than he meant to. The quiet \u201cOw\u201d seemed deafening to him in the silent room. Lewis' head jerked up.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d The whispered voice sounded tired, defeated and James hated it.\n\u201cNothing broken.\u201d Lewis looked back down to the floor. James took a deep breath, it was now or never. \u201cSir?....Please.\u201d He didn't know whether it was the fact that he spoke, of the fact that his voice sounded so pleading, even to his own ears, that made Lewis look up at him.\n\u201cI'm sorry James. Look go home, get some sleep, you don't need to stay\u201d James scowled. That wasn't what he meant and he knew Lewis knew it.\n\u201cNo. Sir this is fruitless, please just come upstairs. You need to eat something, drink something. Sir I... I can't sit by and watch you destroy your self like this.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate it James. But I don't need your help.\u201d Hathaway bit back a frustrated remark. Instead he lowered his head.\n\u201cJust like I didn't need yours eh?\u201d he said quietly. When he looked up again, Lewis was looking at him with a clarity that he hadn't seen for the last 3 hours. He bit the bullet and continued, his eyes staring straight into Lewis' own. \u201cWhere would I be if you'd given up on me sir? If you'd just washed your hands of me and walked away?\u201d He knew neither of them needed to say it. They both knew he'd have burnt alive that night. They both knew that if Lewis hadn't cared, he would be dead.\n\u201cI'm not trapped in a burning building James, I'm not drugged up to the eyeballs either.\u201d\n\u201cYou might as well be sir. Please? Just come out sir. We can come back. If you really need to. Both of us.\u201d James knew he was blabbing, but he didn't want to stop. Just in case Lewis didn't answer, and the silence stretched out again and he'd know he failed.\n\u201cAye. I don't think I'll be back James.\u201d The older man suddenly sounded old for the first time in Hathaway\u2019s experience.\n\u201cIts probably for the best sir. Come on, I'll buy you a pint. By that I mean I have beer in my fridge\u201d He didn't want to say that he didn't trust Lewis to be left alone that night. Lewis smiled at him. It was a small, sad smile, but it was progress. The two men may have entered the basement separately, but they left together.\n\u00a0\n\n**************************************\n\u00a0\nThey hadn't found any thing. James had known they wouldn't from the off and he suspected that deep down Lewis had known it too. It hadn't stopped James returning there alone a day later, unbeknownst to Lewis, just to check, just to be sure that he hadn't deprived his inspector of some vital truth. Sitting on the floor of the basement, he cursed the dead man that had caused his friend so much pain. Cooper must have known what he would cause and James hated him for it. Satisfied that he had been right and that Lewis could have sat down there for years and never found anything, he got up and left, slamming the door behind him. Closing the door on the basement tat had caused his friend so much pain in such a short time.\nHe'd succeeded. He'd been the rock. He'd given back what Lewis had shown to him and he knew that given a little time, his boss would be ok.\nAnd that meant that so would he.\n\u00a0\n", "4": "\nChapter Text\n\u00a0It was no good. He couldn't concentrate. Every flash of the screen, every hint of red or orange and his mouth went dry.Any word beginning with the letters \u201cFI-\u201d and he broke out in a sweat.God knows how the other occupant of the office was feeling. Well, there was on sure-fire way to find out.\u201cFancy a pint sergeant?\u201dA guarded look greeted him, not quite a smile, but not a scowl. Blank. No. Not blank. Carefully controlled. Designed purely to hide feelings. Lewis hated it. He didn't want his colleague to feel like that around him. He wanted the lad to feel like he could talk about things. He'd seen the man take things to heart and he didn't want to leave him to stew over his thoughts on his own. He shouldn't have to. Lewis reminded himself that this was partially his fault. Oh yes, he'd had good reason to be pissed off at Hathaway, more than good a reason. But he shouldn't have lashed out when the lad was that vulnerable, that lost. He should have supported him, took him home, told him to stay there. Maybe then he wouldn\u2019t have got so drunk. Maybe then Zoe Kenneth... He stopped his thoughts. That way lies a guilt trip. Looking at the man in front of him, he realised that he'd need to offer more of a rope to pull him in. He just hoped it wasn't a rope that would hang them both.\u201cI'll even have the orange juice if you want?\u201dThat worked. A smirk worked its way, unbidden onto the younger man's face and he nodded, almost shyly.In the car they talked.Things were said, things that needed to be discussed.In one of them trust was somewhat restored and the other, a sense of loneliness was slightly lifted.Things were almost back to normal.\u00a0Hathaway had the orange juice. He didn't mind.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "5": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cYou seen Hathaway yet?\u201d Lewis said to one of the constables on the desk.\u201cNo Sir. He called in sick sir, said he wasn't coming in.\u201d Lewis shook his head, smiling at the young uniform.\u201cLazy sod. Cheers Chris.\u201d\u201cNo problem guv.\u201d\u00a0****************************************************\u00a0He decided that since James hadn't returned the call he'd made half an hour ago, or replied to the various texts sent since, that there were only two options. One, James was skiving off. Admittedly it didn't seem particularly likely. That left number two. James was genuinely ill. And considerably so, if he wasn't answering texts, the boy was practically glued to his phone. It made Lewis uneasy. In fact the only other time he could remember Hathaway being ill, he'd been with him. And that was hardly the lad's fault, he had been poisoned with arsenic. Either way, it couldn't hurt to pop over after work. Could it?\u00a0Sighing, he pulled up outside James' flat at half 8 that evening. If this was Jim trying to get out of paperwork he'd...well he wasn't sure, but he'd be bloody annoyed.He quickly realised that this wasn't the case, when after five rings, he got no answer at the door. Walking round to the living room window, he saw James slumped on the floor, head rested against the sofa. Lewis silently thanked whatever entity was answerable for decreeing that he ended up in a rough school in Newcastle, where he learnt how to pick locks. He wrestled Hathaway's door open and rushed into the living room.\u201cAh Jim, should have gone to bed ye silly boy\u201d. He wasn't expecting an answer and he didn't get one.\u00a0****************************************************\u00a0After practically carrying Hathaway up to his bedroom, Lewis set about trying to find the things that he would need. He reasoned that the ever-careful Hathaway would have a basic first aid kit somewhere in his house. Once he found it, he pulled out the thermometer and the ibuprofen. Satisfied that James' temperature was below 103.F (he'd learnt that above that was a hospital job. He and Val had to rush Lyn to A&E when she was 5) he returned to James' bedroom to check on him.\u00a0It became apparent to him at about half 9 that James was actually ill. He resigned himself to the fact that it probably meant that he'd be here to the early hours. Not that he really minded. Robbie Lewis wouldn't have had the heart to leave the pale, shuddering form on the bed alone, even if he'd wanted to.\u00a0****************************************************\u00a0He sat up with James through the night. Alternatively trying to cool him down, and get him to sleep. Hathaway's submissiveness, only served to prove to the inspector that he really was ill. He didn't protest as Robbie shoved a glass to his lips, didn't try to shrug the help off as he normally did. He wasn't really sure James even knew he was there, whenever the younger man's eyes were actually open, they were glazed over and he didn't respond to any thing Lewis said.\u00a0He knew that soon would come the shaking, the fatigue and unconsciousness. All this knowledge served to do, was to convince him further that it was a bad idea to leave his sergeant alone that night. The man was clearly not all there and Robbie couldn't trust him to be able to get himself help if he needed. Especially since when he'd arrived, James had been passed out on the floor.\u00a0He pushed away limp hair that was plastered onto the feverish man's face, the movement coming naturally to a man who'd had two children. Satisfied that James wouldn't die in the next 10 minutes, he quickly went to the bath room and prepared a cool flannel, intending it to be used on Hathaway's forehead, which was so hot Lewis was sure he could cook off it. He put it where it was needed, replacing it every time a movement caused it to slide off\u00a0He kept guard over James as he tossed and turned, muttering in the throes of the virus that gripped his system. Held down his limbs as they jerked, the body's response to infection. Woke him up every time the fevered muttering got too frantic, every time the pale face displayed that haunting look of terror.\u00a0When the fever broke, it was a relief to both of them, even if James wasn't alert enough to realise. Lewis had been starting to get worried, he might have nursed his children\u2019s fevers but that was a long time ago. Lewis smiled slightly as the younger man settled into more peaceful sleep.\u00a0****************************************************\u00a0Its disconcerting to realise you've lost twenty four hours of your life. Which is why James Hathaway woke up feeling extremely disconcerted. He was lying in his bed, feeling as weak as a kitten and drenched in sweat. He couldn't remember getting up to his bedroom, but he knew he must have left it because he was in his work shirt and trousers. So he must have got up and got ready for work and never made it there. Once the world had stopped swirling, he turned over and saw the painkillers and thermometer lying on his bedside table. Along with a glass of water, something else he didn't remember sorting out. Soon after while he managed to stagger to the bathroom and change his shirt, washing his face as well.\u00a0After he'd made himself look semi presentable, he made his way slowly downstairs to the kitchen, realising that he hadn't eaten anything for at least the twenty four hours he couldn't remember. He was still shaky but he felt a bit better. Good enough to attempt to make and eat an omelette and try to keep down a cup of tea.\u00a0He was somewhat surprised to see his inspector slumped in the armchair in his living room. Although a lot of things now suddenly made sense. Like how he ended up in bed, with water and painkillers within easy reach.\u201cSir?\u201d He watched as Lewis started awake, blinking blearily at him. He saw the moment where Lewis realised where he was and shifted upright in his seat.\u201cJim. How're you feeling lad?\u201d\u201cBetter sir thank you....Have you, um, been here all night?\u201d Lewis nodded at him, still a little sleepy. James felt a look of gratitude spread across his own face as he watched the older man stand up and stretch his back, groaning.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lewis looked at him, as if the question was ridiculous. There was a sadness in his eyes that James didn't understand.\u201cYou were in a bad way sergeant. You were passed out on the floor when I got here. Couldn't have left you to it could I?\u201d\u201c...Thank you sir\u201d James meant it, now that he thought about it, he had vague recollections of feverish nightmares.\u201cDon't mention it Jim. Its fine, honestly.\u201d His voice told James that he wouldn't accept any more gratitude. Not a natural hero, Robert Lewis. So James decided to show his thanks in the way he knew would be accepted.\u201cSir, since you're here, do you want breakfast?\u201d\u201cIf you're up to it James.\u201d James nodded.\u201cS'least I can do sir. Omelette okay?\u201d He saw the grin on his bosses face and returned it. He didn't miss that Lewis followed him into the kitchen and stayed nearby in case he collapsed again. He made them both breakfast and once they were full up, Lewis jerked his head to the door.\u201cI best be going Jim, Our Lyn's coming over tonight, I need to make the flat...well habitable.\u201d James nodded at him, sitting back from the table with a contended sigh.\u201cYes sir. Er...what day is it?\u201d Lewis snorted quietly as he read James' mind.\u201cSunday sergeant. You don't need to go into the station.\u201d\u201cAh blessed relief.\u201d He got to his feet, alarmed at the way his head seemed to take a little longer to get there than the rest of his body. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cGet away back to bed with ye.\u201d Lewis' grin was tempered with lingering concern. James could see the sense in his words, he was really tired.\u201cWith pleasure sir. Thank you again sir.\u201d Lewis nodded at him in acknowledgement of his thanks and smiled.\u00a0He waited until he was sure his sergeant had made it safely to his room, before he left, closing the door quietly behind him.\u00a0\u201cAnytime kidda, anytime.\u201d\n", "6": "\nChapter Text\n\u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d \u201cSignificance of names, Jim.\u201d\u201cThat's not an answer sir\u201d\u201cNot now James. Please.\u201d\u00a0James had stopped asking then, Lewis was clearly tired and he knew that the smoke inhalation had affected the older man the same way it had him, if not more. He could see how his superior was holding his shoulder stiff, the strain of hauling a tall, if skinny, sergeant out of a burning building who for all intents and purposes, had been a dead weight. He shuddered at this last thought. He had very nearly become one.\u00a0******************************************\u00a0Now, sat in the office before Lewis has turned up, he pondered on the inspectors enigmatic words. His computer whirred into life noisily and it sounded deafening to him in the empty office. He started the internet browser and before he knew what he was doing, he was on a name meaning site\u00a0******************************************\u00a0\n> Robert = Bright Fame\n\n> Lewis = Fame, War.\nWell that wasn't right. Lewis was quite possibly the most modest man he'd ever met. Everyone in the station did seem to know him though, back from his days working with Morse, Hathaway guessed. War, well he was a policeman. They were both fighting some epic eternal war against criminals in a way. But Lewis wasn't an aggressive man either. Unless he was severely provoked and never without good reason. As far as James was concerned, coming face to face with the man who had killed your wife was a good enough excuse to shout at said man. He'd have stopped Lewis from physically damaging Monkford, but Lewis wasn't like that. James decided he would have been. He'd have tried to put Monkford into the floor. It was probably why Lewis was an inspector and he wasn't.\u00a0******************************************\u00a0\n> \u00a0James = Supplanter\n\n> Hathaway = someone who lives by a heath.\nLives by a heath? Well James supposed that Creavecour hall was a big expanse of green space. But it wasn't a heath. And he lived sort of near Wytham woods. But that wasn't a heath either, that was a wood, clue's in the name. And he lived in the city, which was not heathland, last time he looked. He searched again looking for any other meanings.\n> Derived from \u201cHeaethuwig\u201d, meaning 'Strife', 'Contention' and 'war'.\nWell that made more sense. Interesting that both him and his inspector's names meant 'war'. Admittedly it was a war they could never win. Never had the phrase, \u201cYou may have won the battle, but you've yet to win the war\u201d seemed more appropriate to James. Contention seemed to fit too. It had been a big part of his life. Contention between himself and his faith, contention between himself and his friends. Contention between him and his parents. Contention every which way he bloody looked. And Strife was more than apt, considering the last week.\u00a0Supplanter? He'd had to check up on what that meant, but he had been right. The third result on google had provided a suitable answer;\n> A supplanter is one who takes the place or moves into the position of another. \nHe supposed he'd taken the place of the other 4 new sergeants that had been after the job at Kidlington.\u00a0He also supposed that he'd taken Morse's place as Lewis colleague. No, not taken a place, more filled a gap. If anything, Lewis had taken Morse's place and James himself had taken Sergeant Robbie Lewis' place. He'd seen pictures of Sergeant Lewis. He seemed happy in most of them. Always seemed to be smiling. So I haven't completely taken his place then. James had never been that happy sergeant. It wasn't that he was unhappy, just that at the moment, he didn't really have a lot to smile about.\u00a0The more he thought about it, the more he thought that 'supplanter' fitted Lewis better. The older man had supplanted his father's role that was for sure. Lewis had given him more fatherly advice than his 'Dad' ever had. Lewis had come to visit him in hospital, and it was Lewis, not his father that had patched him up after Zoe Kenneth had attempted to kill him. Admittedly this wasn't all his fathers fault. James had turned away when he was 20 and not bothered to look back, but he reasoned that if he wanted to, his dad could find him.\u00a0A small voice in the back of his mind told him that he'd only known Lewis after his two years of drinking. He had no idea whether Lewis had been like Dad when he was drunk. Some how he thought not.\u00a0He sighed as he decided that he needed a coffee. Lewis would be here soon, and he'd be happy to find that James had brought him one as well. It was the least he could do considering the older man had saved his life. A fact that he still hadn't worked out. He hadn't told anyone where he was going,he hadn't even known himself till he found her stood on his front doorstep. How had Lewis known where to find him? Zoe had barely been a suspect. As he stood up a thought made him pause. He bent back down to the computer, accessing the name site again.\u00a0\n> Zoe = Life\n\n> Kenneth = From \u201cCinead\u201d, meaning \u201cborn of fire\u201d.\n\u00a0James finally understood. He figured he owed his inspector a pint.\n", "7": "\nChapter Text\n\u00a0I watch him, sitting at that computer with his back turned to me, and I wonder.\u00a0He's thirty-three. A mere boy, compared to me now. I was thirty-five, when I started working with Morse. No thirty six, I turned thirty six on that first case. Not that much difference between us then.\u00a0Not much difference at all, yet at the same time, a whole generations difference. I was twenty-seven when he was born. Its hard to remember that sometimes, he seems so old. Old and young at the same time. He's seen more...experienced more than most people his age. Not just in the job. I'm not an idiot, I can see that his childhood wasn't as happy as mine was. I don't know what went wrong but, it was bad. He never talks about it. Except once, that one time just after the Zelinsky case went to court.\u00a0\u201cRemanded for sentencing, pending a social report, which will probably say he had a very unhappy childhood\u201d\u201cAnd did he?\u201d\u201cWell who didn't? But we don't all go around abducting ten year old girls do we?\u201d\u00a0I heard it. But I didn't understand, I didn't pick up on it. Does he believe that? 'Who didn't?' I didn't, I mean times were tough in Newcastle in the fifties sure. But I don't look back with sadness. Does he really think that everyone had a bad time of it. Does he know any different? But then I look at the environment he grew up in. Mortmaigne, Hopkiss. Kids are smart and he's smarter than most. Did he work it out, even at the tender age of twelve?\u00a0God...Did he have to work it out? Exactly how unhappy was his childhood? Did...?\u00a0No...No he'd have said something. He'd have reacted worse surely? He'd have told me.\u00a0As soon as I think it, I know that's bollocks. He's a private sod and he wouldn't tell me. He didn't tell me about Will McEwan. I had to force it out of him, shouting match in the street. I regret that, more than he'll know. It felt too close to home. Too close to the screaming arguments I used to have with Ken when he came in two hours late, knowing it was my fault because I wasn't even at home to reinforce the boundaries we tried to set him.\u00a0I hear him sigh as he leans back in the chair, headphones in. He cracks his knuckles and then gets back to work, but not before pulling that contraption out of his pocket and pressing a few buttons. The music changes, I can hear it from here, the office is that bloody quiet. Its changed from the violin sort of sound from before to heavy guitars. Whatever, if he can concentrate through it, who am I to judge? Too many reports typed up whilst trying to block out Morse's Wagner. Must have made me bitter. Funny that, I don't mind a bit of Wagner now.\u00a0That's one way we were different. I was happy at that age. At least I think I was. I was the optimistic one, the chipper Geordie. Jolting Morse out from the dumps, bit of banter to make him smirk. Or scowl depending on his mood. I've looked back at the photographs. I smiled a lot. I always seemed to be smiling. Its odd really; I don't know what I was smiling at. But I was happy. Working with a bloody good, if a bit difficult chief inspector. I had a b...beautiful wife and two amazing kids.\u00a0James doesn't smile nearly as much. And he doesn't have the wife and kids. And he is certainly not working for a clever chief inspector. Although he could be. He's good enough to be an inspector now. I don't think he'll go for it though. He said if I left, he'd leave too. Well I'm not gonna be around for ever. I'm sixty-one. I've got four years left in the force before I'm out on my ear anyway. Maybe less, I've got a sodding doctor's appointment tomorrow. Can't say I'm looking forward to it. I know the drill. 'Eat properly, drink less...and you need more exercise Mr Lewis.' And I'll nod and agree, walk home, cook myself a microwave meal and have a beer. Probably won't even feel guilty about it.\u00a0James' computer beeps at him and he frowns at it, clicking and pressing buttons until it gives in and he gives a satisfied little smirk. One way we were similar. I was good with technology back then as well, I knew who to use a computer. Of course, they didn't do nearly as much as they do now. What with internet banking, downloads and what is it....anti virus software? Well I dunno where I am any more with it all. But at his age, I was pretty damn good at it. Annoyed Morse that did. What did he say? \u201cI never did trust computers, its only people like Lewis that can work them\u201d. Lucky I did know, he could have gone down for murder. I prided myself on it then, something I could do that Morse couldn't, probably one of the only things. But now, James can do everything I can and more. Stuff that I have no idea about. He tried to show me how to use that flipping iTunes thing the other day. Personally, I dunno what's wrong with a bloody Walkman. Although that little iPod thing he has is a bit clever. Something like two thousand songs on it he told me. That's a lot of CD's. Blimey but I'm too old to get the hang of it. I used to know this stuff. Out of touch, out of date, that's me. Maybe I'm not so very different to Morse either.\u00a0Another thing Morse never seemed to get the hang of, that I had down pat; relationships. I was married before I was thirty. Morse made it to sixty-odd and never managed it. Tell a lie, he nearly did, so he told me. But nearly never won a cigar.\u00a0Me and Val were happy. More than happy. I loved her, truly, madly, deeply...or how ever the song goes. She was my rock, my sail, my anchor. I try not to show it, but I miss her, every single bloody day. James knows. I've seen him look at me sadly, like he doesn't know what to say, but feels something needs to be said. I wish I could tell him its my burden to bear, he doesn't need to feel my grief, let alone try and relieve me of it.\u00a0I wonder if he knows grief like this. I know he's lost people, Will McEwan for one. But someone he loved? He never talks about his parents. Not mentioned them once. I don't know what this means. I don't know if they're dead, or estranged from him or something like that. Does it link back to his unhappy childhood? Forgive me, but I hope it does. A terrible father or mother, I can understand, there was enough of that on the estate I grew up on. But the other thing... the poison that spread through Creavecour twenty five odd years ago, and again a year and a half ago. I don't think I could bear it, not if he's gone through that.\u00a0I look at him now, grinning like a Cheshire cat at a joke email someone's sent him. Is he happy? He's got a lot to be happy about, stable career (most of the time), friends, health (if he quits smoking. I think I'm gonna have to work on that one, there's no way I'm letting the cheeky sod go before me). He smiles, he laughs at jokes and he engages in banter. He's witty is our James. But is he happy.? Sometimes he'll say something funny and laugh. I'll join in. But I notice. Its all in the eyes you see. His eyes aren't laughing. I never let on that I've seen and if he realises, he never acknowledges that I know.I want him to be happy. He's a good young man, he'd make someone a good husband someday. He'll make a good father too. I just hope he...lets go of the past at some point so he can realise for himself. I want him to have the same happiness I felt, the wife, the kids. Val would have loved him. It would be different to Morse. She'd encourage me to get him over for dinner, wouldn't mind us going to the pub together. But she'd have recognised the same things in him as I have. The sorrow that he carries around. I don't think he even knows its there any more. He's become so used to it, he just tolerates it. She would have wanted to sort him out, wanted me to sort him out.\u00a0I wish I could sort him out. He's a good lad, he deserves happiness in his life. I'm scared he'll end up like Morse. Old, bitter and not interested in keeping himself healthy. Morse was a fundamentally good man, I was honoured to work with him and pleased to call him a friend. But E.Morse was too smart for his own good and so is James. I don't want James to grow up full of regrets and what ifs. He's a very confused and insecure young man; for reasons I'm not privy to, reasons I don't think I want to be privy to...\u00a0...Reasons I can guess at.\u00a0This won't do, I'm getting worried and angry. I clear my throat and he looks up, like a rabbit caught in headlights. He probably forgot I was there, lost in his world of internet and music. Well good luck to the lad. If that's his escape...well I've seen plenty of young'uns turn to other things for escape. Drink, drugs, crime. Music, well harmless really. He could have turned to something a lot worse. That lad, that lad could have really fucked his life up.\u00a0But he didn't, he's still here, surviving. He may not smile as much as the rest of his peer group, but he's stronger than that. Bloody strong. Come through a lot of shit that boy. I wish I could have saved him from it. I'd never tell him like, one day I'll find a way to let him know, there's people out there that care about him. I really don't think he realises it. Its sad in a way.\u00a0Well, if I can do anything to help him, I will. Duty of care. I've got a duty of care to young James. Its more than that though isn't it Robbie? He's a mate. And if there's one thing I've learned growing up in Newcastle...you stick by your mates.\u00a0He's smiling now. He's worked out where he is and what's going on. He looks tired though. Ah well Lewis, here you go. Try and sort the lad out. He needs someone to do it, he's had 33 years to work it out by himself and look where its got him.\u00a0\u201cFancy a pint lad? Might as well get going. We're not getting anywhere.\u201d The smile spreads above his face. It reaches his eyes this time. I can't help grinning in response. I can tell when something genuinely pleases him and I get a small swell of pride when I've put that grin on his normally inscrutable face.\u201cOf course sir. I can always do with a pint.\u201d\u00a0We walk out the office, he picks his jacket off the back off his chair. I notice that his sleeves are rolled up, just like mine were so often during long, boring slogs through paperwork when I was a DS. But I watch him walk down the corridor and I no longer recognise my self in him. He still looks like he's carrying the world on his shoulders, the weight of it is pressing him down. One so young shouldn't look like that. I'm pretty sure I never did.\u00a0In some ways, we weren't so very different, him and me. But in others...in other ways, we couldn't have been further apart.\n", "8": "\nChapter Text\nThey'd solved the case, and as such, felt they deserved a reward. Well James and Robbie felt they did. They weren't exactly sure why Innocent and Hobson were with them, but neither man was really bothered.\u00a0So it was that all four of them were sat at a bench in the Trout's beer garden, toasting each other's health and the end of another case.\u00a0\u201cGood work boys\u201d Lewis raised his eyebrow. Boy? I'm old enough to be your father Jean...well at a push anyway.  Lewis found himself grinning as James fell back theatrically, clutching at his heart.\u201cPraise? What on earth is happening? This is unheard of...Sir, I think I'm hallucinating.\u201d\u201cShut up James.\u201d Innocent snapped at him but they all knew she was trying not to laugh at the younger man's antics. Lewis chuckled and Laura smiled as James almost toppled off of the back of the bench. Robbie grabbed his arm and stopped him falling on his head.\u201cCheeky sod, I should just've let ye fall. One of these days you're gonna end up with a demotion on your hands.\u201d\u201cYes James, you should be grateful that I'm in a good mood.\u201d James bowed his head.\u201cYes m'lady.\u201d Robbie snorted.\u201cYou've been at the beer too much lad.\u201dThe ladies watched the evolving banter with a considerable amount of amusement. It was always preferable when these two were happy. They seemed to require no effort with each other, and as a result, they were good company to be in.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0The evening wore on in the same vein for a long while. Lewis could see that James was drinking steadily. He couldn't blame the lad, it had been a tough case, but he made a mental note to keep an eye on him nonetheless. For the most part, the young man was being jovial and entertaining. A lot of his awkwardness seemed to disappear with his sobriety. Laura caught him looking and they shared a smile, it was nice to see James come out of himself for a little while.\u00a0Then a man came over to their table and Lewis tensed immediately. Trench coat, sunglasses perched on his head, notebook in his pocket...a reporter. James caught his expression and turned around noticing all the same things as Lewis had and mirroring his scowl.\u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d Lewis asked, the epitome of politeness. The reporter ignored him and looked straight at Innocent.\u201cMrs Jean Innocent? Detective chief Superintendent Innocent? John Bates of the Oxford mail.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou don't have to talk to him Jean.\u201d came a low voice from Lewis' left. Ah. It appeared that jovial drunk James had gone. Well this was going to prove interesting at the very least.\u201cI am aware of that Sergeant\u201d Jean Innocent said coolly. \u201cI think having attained the aforementioned rank, I am aware how to handle the press.\u201d Her tone wasn't designed to be rude, just to put the inebriated younger man in his place.\u201cHandle us eh? Not a very charitable view of the press you have is it superintendent?\u201d\u201cNot when they accost me during my time off, no.\u201d\u201cYou are a police woman, you are never off duty.\u201d\u201cJa-mes...\u201d Lewis warned softly as he saw his sergeant's fists clenching under the table. The younger man shot him a look that clearly said; 'If he carries on, I'm going to hit him'. Lewis raised his eyebrow in warning as he turned to face the other man fully.\u201cThat maybe true. But everyone is entitled to a little peace eh? If you want some sort of interview, wait until Monday.\u201d\u201cYeah, shove off\u201d James muttered under his breath, only Laura hearing him.\u201cI'm going to get another round in. James, would you come and help me carry it back\u201d. Hobson said, attempting to remove James before he caused a problem. Hathaway faltered for a moment and Lewis hoped that he would leave. His sergeant had the best of intentions, but he was only making things worse, being overly antagonistic. Robbie smiled at Laura, thank you.James turned and started to walk away with Laura. The reporter chose this moment to make another snide comment.\u201cDon't worry, I won't wait until Monday, I'll get a story written today, ready for the Sunday papers.\u201d\u201cAnd pray tell me what will that be?\u201d Innocent asked, growing increasingly irritated with this man who wouldn't leave.\u201cOh, it'll be a feature piece. On the young sergeant there, clearly under-disciplined. And his inspector who obviously doesn't teach him procedure.\u201d\u201cThat piece will never be printed.\u201d\u201cWon't it? I wonder Mrs Innocent, how the public will feel, reading about the superintendent who would rather spend time in the pub with her colleagues than keep the public informed on their safety.\u201d Lewis scowled at the man and thanked Laura for removing young James from the situation before he could do something stupid. No sooner had the thought made it through his head, than he heard a shout of \u201cNo James!\u201d. Too late, he turned to see the young man behind him. Before he had a chance to stop him, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway had put the reporter on the floor with a single punch and was now standing, menace written across his features.\u201cDetective Chief Superintendent Innocent does her best for the public and nothing that a poisonous little toad like you can print will convince anybody otherwise!\u201d Lewis grabbed James roughly by the shoulder and forced him to sit down on the bench. James made to get up again but Lewis was insistent.\u201cStay there!\u201d he hissed, anger in his voice that made the still drunk sergeant realise what he had done. Not that he regretted it.\u201cAh. Under-disciplined and violent to boot. My paper is going to have a field day.\u201d The reporter had struggled up from his position on the ground. Lewis rolled his eyes. The press! Never took a hint. Even when it was quite literally pushed in their faces.\u00a0The reporter had got up now, declining to take Lewis' offered hand. He glared at James and snarled at him.\u201cYour career is finished sergeant! You see if it isn't!\u201d He left hurriedly, sunglasses re positioned to cover the black eye that was already forming. Lewis started after him but Innocent put out her hand.\u201cLet him go Robbie. I meant what I said. That article won't be printed.\u201d James looked up, confusion written on his face.\u201cYes James, I did say that. If you had been behaving properly, Laura wouldn't have had to remove you for that bit of the conversation.\u201d\u201cBut...The article? How?...\u201d James trailed off miserably, realising that what he'd done must surely have repercussions.\u201cI happen to know the editor of the Oxford Mail. I also happen to know that he has been looking for an excuse to...relieve Mr Bates from his duties. I think harassment and involvement in an altercation with the police will be sufficient reason.\u201d Jean nodded with the end of the sentence and looked at James, sat on the bench, looking for all the world like a schoolboy sat outside the headmasters office\u201cUm...What about?...What's going to happen to me Ma'am?\u201d Jean almost couldn't hide the smile that was threatening. She could see Laura and Robbie having a similar problem. James really did look adorable, sat there trying to act nonchalant when in actual fact he was just a drunk young man who had done something pretty stupid but not entirely ignoble.\u201cWe'll talk tomorrow Sergeant\u201d, she said in her best stern voice, sure that any other tone would just result in her, Robbie and Laura breaking down into laughter. \u201cWhen you've sobered up a bit and thought about this some more.\u201d James nodded dejectedly and she took pity on him.\u201cDon't worry James, I know you had the best of intentions\u201d\u201cThe road to hell is paved with the best of intentions.\u201d James mumbled sadly. Robbie snorted softly at him.\u201cI think you'll find that it's 'good' intentions lad. Come on you daft sod, lets get you home.\u201d Jean and Laura nodded at this idea and James let himself be lead out of the beer garden.\u00a0Lewis could hear the girls giggling as they left and he found it very hard not to laugh himself.\u201cMight have done something stupid sir.\u201d\u201cAye, I think you might have done lad.\u201d\u201cDunno how to fix it.\u201d\u201cCan't help you there, you'll just have to hope Innocent feels merciful tomorrow morning.\u201d James sighs ans bows his head.\u201cI have to admit though, you got back from the bar quite quickly Jim.\u201d\u201cWell, truth be told sir, I was already half way back to start shouting at him when he started saying things about you. And then I heard the rest and...\u201d\u201cThump?\u201d supplied Lewis. He couldn't help but feel a little touched that Hathaway was ready to defend him as well. And a little guilty that he hadn't stuck up for James. All thoughts were dispelled as they arrived at James' front door and the man in question fumbled his key into the lock.As James let himself in, Lewis grinned at him.\u201cYe daft idiot. What are we gonna do with ye eh?\u201d\u201cDunno sir, Innocent will probably think of something.\u201d\u201cGo to sleep James. And be ready in the morning.\u201d He smiled again at James' worried and abashed expression.\u201cDon't worry bonny lad, she'll not kill ye.\u201d Grinning to himself, he walked off in the direction of home.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0The Sergeant stood inside Innocent's office the next morning, fighting both a terrible headache and a feeling of nausea as the well deserved hangover made its presence felt.He hung his head, hoping that Innocent wouldn't shout too much. His head really did hurt.\u201cYou're behaviour yesterday wasn't very professional Hathaway, even if it was guided by alcohol.\u201d\u201cI'm sorry ma'am.\u201d\u201chowever, I am touched that you felt the need to defend my honour, but really James, you can't just go around punching people that say things you don't like. It isn't professional and it'll get you into all sorts of trouble.\u201d James nodded.\u201cI understand ma'am. I'm sorry.\u201d\u201cYou look a sorry sight, that's for sure. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cterrible Ma'am. I feel foolish and extremely hungover and...\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cMy er, my right knuckles hurt like hell.\u201d Innocent glanced down at the sergeants right hand and saw a little bit of bruising around the knuckles.\u201cWell if you will go around being drunk and chivalrous James...\u201d\u201cYes, I know, only myself to blame...Um What happens now?\u201d\u201cWell since, the incident hasn't been officially reported, I think you can get away with a verbal warning. After all, it would be churlish to discipline the man that gallantly and chivalrously, albeit drunkenly, to my rescue.\u201d\u201cThank you ma'am. I assure you it won't occur again.\u201d\u201cI should hope not...Go on James, go home nurse that hangover and be ready for work on Monday.\u201d He nodded and leaves, missing the grin that's broken out across Jean Innocents face. Trust Hathaway to actually have taken all this seriously, to have actually thought he could lose his job over such a petty incident.\u00a0On the other side of the door, Lewis is also grinning. His sergeant is nothing if not bloody jammy. James came out and Lewis threw a companionable arm around the sergeant's shoulder.\u201cYou my boy, are very bloody lucky lad.\u201d\u201cTell me about it\u201d James says exhaling in relief.\u201cFancy a pint?\u201dJames groans and Lewis easily sidesteps the swipe that is directed in his direction, grinning. Its not often that he has the drop on his younger friend. But he takes pity on the suffering young man.\u201cI know what you need, and its not a pint.\u201d\u201cI could have told you that\u201d\u201cYou my boy, need a proper fry up.\u201d\u201cYou cooking?\u201d James asks.\u201cI'm cooking.\u201d Lewis confirms with a nod.\u201cYou're on\u201d.\u00a0They walk down the corridor in comfortable silence until Lewis stops.\u201cOf course...this means I'm going to need to go and buy some eggs.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n", "9": "\nChapter Text\nJames leans against the station wall, drawing deeply on the cigarette held in between his fingers. A slow smile spreads across his face as he feels the calm seep through his body. If there's one thing he loves, its the very unnatural high he gets from the first cig of the day. He's not stupid, he knows that this is only the relief of withdrawal symptoms, but this is of little consequence to him. It feels good, and after such a hard case, that's all he cares about.A cigarette butt is thrown to the side and Hathaway smiles as he remembers Lewis picking up one of his similar butts ad handing it back to him, exasperation on his face. Lewis has never understood his addiction. Lewis hasn't really understood much of him he supposes. He hasn't really made it easy, but then, he doesn't understand himself.The man himself rounds the corner and slumps against the wall next to him. He can tell that Lewis has been finding the case as hard as he has. He'd offer the inspector a cigarette if he didn't think that it would disgust the man. Lewis sighs and turns to look at him, an appraising and...almost sorrowful look.\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cWhy do you do it Jim? Smoke, I mean.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ******************************************The words are out of Robbie's mouth before he realises he's going to say it. Every time James lights up, every time he fiddles with his coat pocket, every time his coffee breaks take five minutes longer than Robbie knows the machine takes to make coffee; he wants to grab the lad and stop him. Lewis gets flash backs to LePlassiter and he desperately doesn't want that for his sergeant. He doesn't want to be going to visiting his sergeant in hospital, doesn't want to think that his colleague and friend who is thirty odd years his junior, could die before him. So he turns to look at the younger man, determined that if the reason isn't good enough, James Hathaway is going to quit smoking.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ******************************************James looks back at him. He doesn't really know how to explain this. Does he love smoking? That's what he wants to say; that he loves it, the feeling of calm it gives him. Does he even like it though? He's not overly keen on the taste, not overly bothered by the smell. But can he honestly say he likes it? He knows what its doing to him, what it could mean for him. He knows that with every drag of the cig, he's taking himself one step closer to death. But the feeling of calm...surely if it wasn't for the smoking, his heart would have given out to the stress? But these thoughts don't even make sense to him, so he has no idea how to explain it to his boss. He takes a long drag, much to the disapproving glare of Lewis and blows it out the side of his mouth, careful to direct the smoke from his friend's face.Stalling for time. Eventually he gives up, realising that Lewis really won't let this go.\u201cI started when I was fifteen sir. I er, I didn't really get on well in secondary school. Might have been a posh public school, but I was still only an estate manager's son. I wasn't nobility, and I was never going to be.\u201d He sneaks a look at Lewis to gauge his reaction but the face is blank so he carries on.\u201cI wanted to fit in. The kids that would have any chance of actually talking to me, well they were smoking. And I wanted to talk to them. So I started too.\u201dLewis raises his eyebrow and James grins sheepishly.\u201cThere you have it sir, the origin of my long, loving and intimate relationship with nicotine. No hidden trauma, no amazing story. S'bit pathetic really.\u201d\u201cYou could stop now. You fit in here.\u201d\u201cI could...but I don't want to. In truth sir, well I enjoy it. Maybe its addiction, maybe its not, but I do love the calm feeling it gives me. The only other way to get that is to get drunk...and I don't think Innocent would be all that happy with me drinking JD during duty hours.\u201d\u201cAye, that she wouldn't.\u201d Lewis grins and then sighs sadly. \u201cYou just think about it eh?\u201dJames nods as Lewis turns to go back inside. But as he watches the retreating back he knows he's a lost cause. He was serious about the intimate loving relationship thing he span to Lewis. He has no desire to break it up either.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n", "10": "\nChapter Text\nJames Hathaway was drunk. Not falling over and spewing up drunk, just pleasantly inebriated. He knew he was drunk because all the cars heading towards them so far seemed to have 3 headlights. Is inspector was also drunk, James could tell by the way Lewis kept stumbling. He was a detective after all.People kept walking towards them, unsurprising considering they were walking down a street. Some people smiled at them, some people gave them vaguely disgusted looks which James thought was unfair, they weren't that drunk. A thought struck him. A thought that he probably wouldn't have had and definitely wouldn't have voiced if he were sober.\u201c\"You know, all these people we're walking past sir, they probably think I'm your son.\" Lewis stopped and looked at him, incredulity swamping his face and for a second, James feared he'd overstepped the mark. However Lewis merely broke into a cheeky grin as he answered.\u201cNot with that hair they wouldn't lad.\u201d James flashed him an answering grin and they both staggered on towards the direction of home. James had been just about to comment on how the cars adorned with three headlights had suddenly managed to grow two more headlights each when he realised that Lewis was no longer walking next to him. He stopped and turned, wondering why the inspector had ceased to walk. Lewis had a sleepy, sweet smile on his face and it confused James greatly. Just before he managed to get a question out, Robbie spoke.\u201cI wouldn't mind you know Jim. If the people thought that I mean.\u201d James could feel his face split into a wide smile and he felt warm inside. Although, he reasoned that could be the beer. Perhaps 'reasoned' was stretching it a little. His thoughts didn't really get that far. He just knew he was happy. He waited for Robbie to catch up and they stumbled on, James trying to subtly search passer-by's faces to see if they did think he as Robbie's son. He couldn't tell, but he decided that everyone was just being secretive tonight. He felt Robbie's hand on his elbow, guiding him sideways, h nearly fought against it, until he realised that Lewis was trying to stop him from walking into a bin. He grinned, wanting to thank Robbie for saving his life; bins were dangerous adversaries. Especially when they had glass in them, his own had attacked him more times than he could remember. Instead of the words he'd meant to say though, something entirely different came out.\u201cI don't think I'd mind either sir.\u201d He shrugged as Lewis smiled a fond, happy, decidedly drunken smile.\u00a0Might not have been what he meant to say, but it didn't make it any less true.\u00a0One thing he would mind however, him and Lewis both, would be the hangover he was going to have the next morning.\u00a0\n", "11": "\nChapter Text\nJames Hathaway didn't feel right. He was trying his best to ignore the feeling, but he couldn't deny that he felt rough. He didn't know exactly what was wrong but his vision kept blurring and he was finding it difficult to concentrate. They were working on a difficult case, involving codes and puzzles written in some undecipherable mix of Egyptian Hieroglyphs and shorthand. He'd been up nearly the whole night trying to work it out and he felt dog tired.\u00a0Lewis had to say his name three times before he realised he was supposed to respond.\u201cSir?\u201d he said finally.\u201cAre you ok James? You normally have some glib comment ready when I shout at you more than once.\u201d\u201cFine sir. Just really tired. Did too much research last night.\u201d He saw Lewis' sceptical look, but he was grateful that the older man didn't push the point. He didn't want to admit he was ill, he knew how badly the inspector wanted to get this killer.\u201cIf you're sure lad? Maybe you should go home earlier today.\u201d\u201cI'll be fine sir. I'll go home when we catch this bastard.\u201d Lewis gave a soft snort of amusement.\u201cYou won't be any good if you're too tired to run after him sergeant.\u201d\u201cI know sir. I promise that I'll get a good nights sleep tonight.\u201d James replied, hoping that this would get his friend to drop it. He watched Lewis merely raise a resigned eyebrow and then look back at his paperwork.\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0It was about an hour later when Lewis decided that he needed some sort of caffeine fix to get through the next part of the day.\u201cFancy a coffee James?...James?\u201d The younger man didn't answer straight away, instead rubbing a hand across his forehead.\u201cWhat? Oh, er Coffee, er, no thanks sir.\u201d Lewis gave him a searching look.\u201cAre you sure you're ok?\u201d\u201cYes. Just got a bit of headache that's all.\u201d Robbie shrugged and left the office, deciding that the younger man was in need of some water.\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0When he returned, his sergeant was slumped over the desk. At first Lewis had just thought he was asleep, but the lines of pain on his face told him that something more sinister was going on.\u201cJames? James? Lad, are you alright?\u201dRobbie couldn't keep the worry from his voice. No discernible answer was forthcoming, apart from a mumble from the younger man. Lewis crouched down to his sergeant and laid a hand on James' shoulder.\u201cJim, what's wrong? Come on son, how can I help you if you won't tell me?\u201d\u201cHead. Hurtss.\u201d James ground out. Lewis was immediately concerned. Very rarely did James slur his speech like that, and never without the aid of several beers.He squeezed James' shoulder and attempted to sit him up, but Hathaway cried out and tried to put his head back on the desk.\u201cNot moving\u201d\u201cPlease James, we've gotta get you home.\u201d\u201cNo!...Hurtss to move\u201d Lewis was more than concerned now, he was close to panic. He didn't know what was wrong and James didn't seem able to tell him.\u201cOk\u201d Lewis said, mindful to keep his voice low, since noise seemed to be making James worse. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just want tto ssleep.\u201d\u201cYou can't stay here like this Jim. Come on, let me take you home.\u201d James groaned and stayed in the position he was in, hunched over his desk.\u201cSir. Can't. Please\u201dLewis was at a loss of what to do but he couldn't just stand by and leave the younger man to it. He settled on pulling his chair over to Hathaway's and putting his hand on the sergeants back, gently rubbing circles on it. He wasn't sure if he was doing any good but James hadn't told him to stop and he'd ceased groaning in pain.\u00a0That was how Innocent found them when she walked past ten minutes later. At first she thought James was crying, but she dismissed this almost immediately. Even if James did feel safe crying in front of Lewis (which she somewhat doubted), he wouldn't in the station. It was Lewis' look that made her knock on the door though. He looked panicked. Uncertainty and apprehension all rolled into one. Lewis' head shot up, and James' tried to burrow into the desk.\u201cMa'am?\u201d\u201cLewis. What's going on? You don't look like you're working.\u201d She said it softly, she wasn't annoyed with them, evidently something was wrong with the youngest member of the duo.\u201cS'James Ma'am. He won't say what's wrong. He won't let me take him home I don't know what to do.\u201d Jean could hear the fear in the inspectors voice and she smiled to herself. Robbie Lewis cared too much. Not that she'd have him any other way.\u201cWhat's he said then?\u201d\u201cSaid his head hurts, and he's been slurring his speech.\u201d Jean bent down so she was at eye level to James. Or would have been if he'd had his eyes open and his head wasn't facing the desk.\u201cJames? How do you feel now?\u201d He didn't answer and Jean began to have a sneaking suspicion as to what was wrong. She turned to Lewis.\u201cHe's having a migraine Robbie. That would explain why he wouldn't let you move him.\u201d Lewis relaxed a little now that he had some idea what was going on.\u201cWhat do we do? I don't know, I've never had a migraine.\u201d Jean quickly went into care-mode.\u201cDraw the blinds Robbie. And turn the computers off. And the light.\u201d Lewis quickly complied, acutely aware that James hadn't so much as moved since Jean had tried to talk to him.\u00a0Jean had returned to her office briefly, to get some pain killers (she kept some in her desk ever since the fiasco Hathaway had created over the Hugh Mallory case), and a cup of water for the young sergeant. So for the moment, Lewis was sat in the office on his own with Hathaway. Even now that he knew what was wrong, Lewis felt uncomfortable. He still didn't know what to do. He wanted to talk to Hathaway, to try and make him feel better, but he couldn't be sure that that would make his sergeant's pain worse. He decided that all he could do was put a hand on the lad's back and be ready to help him if he needed it. For his part, James hadn't moved or made any comprehensible sound since Jean Innocent had left the room. He continued to rest his head on the desk, the odd moan leaving his lips.\u00a0Eventually, Innocent came back with the water and painkillers and between them, Robbie and Jean managed to coax Hathaway into moving enough to take them. Robbie had a moment of genuine panic when James carried out an instinctive action and knocked his head back to take the pills, which resulted in him nearly passing out. Rather than try to get James to move, Jean sent Lewis out of the office to find some sort of blanket.Lewis returned after 10 minutes carrying a two blankets.\u201cMa'am? Is he any better?\u201d\u201cNot really Robbie. He could be like this for 48 odd hours...Why do you have two blankets?\u201d Lewis gazed down at his hands, worry still on his face from Innocent's revelation.\u201cWhat?...Er, oh, I thought I could make one into a pillow?\u201d Jean smiled at him, trust the older man to think of something like that.\u00a0Ten minutes later and they had James settled, head resting on a folded up blanket, and the other blanket draped over him, to combat the chill of lying on the floor. The combination of tiredness and the medication he had taken meant that James soon fell into a fitful sleep. Lewis and Innocent stayed as quiet as they could, talking in hushed whispers. Innocent sat on the edge of James desk, whereas Robbie opted to sit on the floor against the wall nearby to Hathaway's head. Part of Innocent wanted to gently remind the inspector that his back was going to really hurt when he got up, but she knew him well enough to know that he'd insist he'd be fine. And that when something was wrong with James, the inspector didn't think of himself. That much was evident from the way that he'd run into a burning building to save the young sergeant.\u201cHow long do you think it'll last ma'am?\u201d\u201cThe headache?\u201d Lewis nodded and Jean could see the worry in his eyes. It was sweet, after all, it was only a migraine. Of course they were very painful and they were hellish to go through, but they weren't life threatening. But Robbie was acting as if James was gravely ill. Jean supposed it was one of those things that he just didn't have any experience of, and as such, it scared him more than it should. She however, did have experience of them and could fully sympathise with Hathaway's predicament.\u201cYes ma'am.\u201d\u201cI don't know Robbie, it varies from person to person. Hopefully, when he wakes up, it'll have eased off a bit.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then I suggest you take him home and make him go to bed. And I mean bed Lewis, not the sofa. Darken the room as best you can and give him some more painkillers.\u201d\u201cRight...\u201d the inspector paused, watching the sleeping man. \u201cBlimey, he could be my Ken lying there like that. He's only a couple of years older and the amount of times I woke up to find Ken asleep on me bedroom floor after he'd had a nightmare...\u201d. He trailed off, realising what he was implying to the woman beside him. Not that it really mattered. He did see James as a son, and it wasn't like Jean Innocent would disapprove, she'd probably be the first to agree that the lad needed it. He needed a father figure, needed someone to look after him. It never once occurred to Robbie that there was no one to do the same for him. It never once occurred to him that James Hathaway was trying to do the same for him.\u00a0An hour later, Hathaway stirred. Innocent had already gone back to her office, albeit reluctantly. She had wanted to stay and make sure that the man was ok, but she had a police station to run. Lewis was still sat on the floor near to his head and he was instantly watching the younger man.\u00a0James shifted slightly as he blinked his eyes open, coming alert when he realised that the ceiling he was staring at wasn't his own. Heavy lidded, he looked around in the confusion that newly awakened people do. Lewis watched all this, smiling slightly at seeing Hathaway at his most...Hathaway-ish. That's when people are most like themselves;when they first wake up, before they project the version of themselves that they want people to see. Lewis couldn't help but think that James looked like a kid when he first woke up. Although Robbie had to admit to himself it was probably Hathaway's cropped hair and the way he was almost curled into the foetal position that did it.\u201cSir?\u201d, James croaked. Lewis could almost see the rest of the question in his eyes; 'What am I doing lying on the station floor wrapped in a cell blanket?'\u201cJim. How're you feeling?\u201d\u201cLike someone's had me in a boxing ring for the last 4 hours.\u201d Lewis took the fact that Hathaway speaking quietly to mean that he still had a headache. Not as bad as before, because James had moved his head around so that he could see the inspector, and he was no longer slurring his speech.\u201cHow's your head?\u201d\u201c...Pounding. Could easily sleep another twelve hours.\u201d Lewis smiled softly behind him.\u201cWell lad, you can't spend another twelve hours there. You up to moving?\u201d\u201cEr...one way to find out?\u201d James did not look thrilled at the prospect. Lewis stood up, groaning as his back protested at being leant against a cold, hard wall for at least an hour and a half. As he went to grab the as yet untouched water, he saw James gingerly sit up. He also saw the colour drain from the younger man's face. Robbie quickly went back to where James was, crouching down and making sure he'd be there to catch James if he passed out again.\u201cEasy kidda. Take it easy.\u201d With Robbie's help, James managed to stand up and sit in a computer chair without passing out.\u201cUgh. Feel sick sir.\u201d\u201cHave a drink. Just sip it mind, or you will throw up.\u201d James nodded and Lewis watched to make sure he really did drink, before grabbing the blankets of the floor and folding them up ready to be taken back down to the cells. He then waited for ten minutes to make sure that James actually kept the water he'd drunk down.\u201cWill you be alright James? I've gotta go and tell Innocent that I'm taking you home.\u201d\u201cNo need sir. I'm ok.\u201d\u201cYou said that before lad, and then you went and pretty much collapsed. Forgive me if I don't believe you\u201d Lewis replied dryly. \u201cAnyway Innocent will want to know you're a bit better. She was worried about you.\u201d\u201cI'm sure I'll be ok for ten minutes sir. There's really no need to take-\u201d Lewis cut him off with a hand in the air.\u201cThere is absolutely no way, I am letting you go home under your own steam.\u201d James was just about to reply when Lewis carried on, in a slightly more passive tone. \u201cAnd besides, what happens if I let you drive back and you black out at the wheel eh? You could kill more people than just yourself.\u201dJames clearly hadn't thought that far ahead and his eyes widened a little as he took in what Lewis had just said to him.\u201cOh...\u201d he said quietly.\u201cOh indeed. Get anything you need to take back with you, I'm gonna go and see Innocent.\u201d\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0\u201cMa'am?\u201d Lewis poked his head around the door as he knocked on it. Jean beckoned him in.\u201cRobbie. How is he?\u201d She could see from the more relaxed look on the inspectors face that nothing bad had happened since she'd left.\u201cHe's awake. He says he feels sick, but I think the headaches eased a bit.\u201d\u201cThat's good. Did he get up?\u201d\u201cYes. I mean, he was a little shaky but he is sitting in the chair now. I'm gonna take him home.\u201d\u201cI think that's for the best Robbie. I'm glad he's feeling a bit better though, I've known people to have a migraine like that for over 24 hours.\u201d it was Lewis' turn for his eyes to widen.\u201cTwenty four...bloody hell!\u201d\u201cIndeed Robbie.Go on, go and take that boy home.\u201d Lewis grinned and nodded before leaving, closing the door behind him.\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0\u201cCome on champ, up you get.\u201d James raised an eyebrow, but didn't comment. He didn't feel up to banter. He was unbelievably grateful for Lewis' steadying hand on his shoulder as he got up, his legs felt like jelly.\u201cYou alright?\u201d\u201cThink so sir. Feel like I've just run a thousand metres.\u201d\u201cCuppa tea and bed that's what you need Jim.\u201d\u201cSounds bloody amazing right now.\u201d\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0It had taken them a little while to get to the car. James' headache hadn't been as gone as they'd thought it had. And they had to stop for him to throw up twice on the way home. But eventually they got back to James house. Hathaway leaned against the door frame with his eyes closed as Lewis took his keys off him and let them both in.James went to sit on the sofa, but Lewis grabbed his shoulder gently.\u201cIf you sit down there, we'll never get you upstairs. Come on.\u201d James grinned tiredly and went up to his room, while Lewis readied a cup of water and the painkillers to take upstairs.\u00a0When Lewis went upstairs, James was already lying on his bed. Robbie chuckled as he realised that Hathaway hadn't even gotten out of his shirt, although he did appear to have taken his trousers and tie off. When he walked into the room, James stirred.\u201cWa'n't 'sleep sir.\u201d\u201cCourse you weren't lad. Come on. Take the painkillers and then get some sleep.\u201d James nodded sleepily as he took the proffered drink and pills. Lewis pulled the duvet over the semi-conscious young man and then retired to the sofa. He didn't think Jim would mind. And he'd forgotten to ask Innocent if migraines could get better and then worse. He felt it'd be better to be safe than sorry.\u00a0*****************************************************\u00a0In the morning, James came downstairs, just as Lewis was starting to make tea.\u201cSir, you didn't have to stay.\u201d\u201cMorning to you too\u201d Robbie said, grinning. \u201cFeelin' better?\u201d\u201cMuch better sir....Thank you.\u201d\u201cDon't mention it Jim. Now, get some food into you and I'll give you a lift to the station to get your car.\u201d James smiled.\u201cThank you sir. Really you didn't have to-\u201d\u201cI told you. Don't mention it. Just next time you feel ill Jim...\u201d Robbie's face turned serious, and for a split second, James saw the fear that Lewis had felt when he'd passed out.\u201cNext time, tell me before it gets that bad eh? Too many experiences like that, seeing you slumped over the desk, slurring your speech an' all. Not good for old blokes like me.\u201d James nodded, suitably chastised at the worry he had caused by trying to work through a migraine. But a little part of him was staggered by the care the older man had shown for him.\u201cPromise sir.\u201d It was the least he could do. And he fully intended to do more. Namely cook them both breakfast.\u201cGood lad.\u201d\u00a0James smiled as he began to make an omelette. He felt better, he was ready for a day at work and he knew he had friends he could count on.\u00a0It didn't stop him slipping the painkillers into his pocket though.\u00a0Just in case.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n", "12": "\nChapter Text\nJames sat by the hospital bed, scratching absently at the scab on his arm. He sighed, watching the sleeping man in the bed.\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0\nHe'd watched Lewis go down, dropped by the bullet that slammed into the inspector's thigh. James had cannoned into the suspect, full of rage and no thought for his own safety. He'd acquired slashed arm for his troubles, but that was insignificant.\n\u00a0\nOnce the suspect had been handcuffed to a nearby radiator, James was on the phone, bellowing for an ambulance as he skidded to a stop by his boss.\n\u00a0\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cJames...did you get him?\u201d\u201cYes. He's handcuffed to the radiator...I er, I might have neglected to turn it off.\u201d\u201cYou're going to have human rights on your back for that one.\u201d\u201cI have to admit sir, at this particular moment in time, I couldn't give a shit.\u201d He must have looked as scared as he felt, because Lewis smiled slightly and touched his arm.\u201cLad, I'm ok. I'm not bloody dying, it just really sodding hurts.\u201d\u00a0\n10 minutes later, paramedics were performing CPR in the back of an ambulance, while James sat nearby, helplessness swamping him as he thought he was losing his friend.\n\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0Now, watching the older man sleep, he still couldn't fully come to terms with the fact that Robbie would be okay. He felt like he'd lost years off his life. He could still see the paramedics pumping their hands up and down on Lewis' chest.\u00a0Loss of blood they said. Bullet had nicked the femoral artery. Not enough to make him bleed to death in minutes. But enough for him to be bleeding steadily inside and for James not to notice. He found that he couldn't look at Lewis' chest. Every time he did, he saw the palms pressing into them, trying to restart the muscle in the centre.\u00a0So he focused on the inspector's face. It was pale and James could swear that there were several more lines on it that there had been a week ago. Admittedly there wasn't normally a breathing tube attached to Robbie's nose either. James had been worried when he'd seen that, but the nurse had assured him that it was just to ensure that Lewis would get enough oxygen, it wasn't a reflection of his breathing.\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0\u201cSir? Come on Lewis, wake up.\u201d It hadn't made a difference that first night. He'd pleaded with the unconscious inspector to be ok. Lewis hadn't even stirred. James had sat there for hours, only moving when a concerned nurse had forced him to go and get a drink and some food before he ended up in a hospital bed too.\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0The inspector groaned in the bed and James was instantly sat forward. He could see Lewis' eyes moving under his eyelids and he knew that the older man was trying to wake up.\u201cCome on sir. Nearly there.\u201d Robbie slowly opened his eyes.\u201cJa...\u201d\u201cSssh. Wait a minute sir. Have a drink\u201d James grabbed the cup of ice chips by the bed and carefully spooned some into Lewis' mouth. Once his throat was no longer dry, Lewis tried again.\u201cWhat...What happened?\u201d\u201cYou got shot sir. Leg, it er, nicked your femoral.\u201d James was aware that his voice was shaking, and he could see that Lewis could tell.\u201cJames...\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cStop worrying James. I'm ok.\u201d\u201cWith all due respect sir. You said that last time.\u201d Lewis raised an eyebrow at him. He evidently didn't remember that.\u201cI did?\u201d He rasped. James nodded.\u201cYes. And then you proceeded to go and have your heart stop in the ambulance! So I apologise if I wait for the doctors to tell me this time.\u201d He'd said it harsher than he'd meant to, all the worry and frustration of the past week bubbling to the surface. Lewis was quiet, digesting what had been said. He could see the haunted look in James' eyes.\u201cSorry kidda.\u201d James shook his head.\u201cNo, don't be. Sorry sir, just...you know.\u201d Lewis nodded. He did know, he knew all to well. Running into a burning building to find his sergeant passed out on the bed. He hadn't known James had been drugged then, he'd thought the smoke had over come him. For a split second, he'd thought he was already dead. And then seeing the younger man attempt to run back into the house after his would be murderer. Being told by a doctor that James'd be fine and then seeing the young man lying unresponsive in the bed, pale with a cut on his cheek and soot in his lungs. Robbie realised that James hadn't even had that assurance that he'd be fine.\u201cPromise you this time. That I'm ok I mean.\u201d\u201cDon't sir. Don't make a promise that you can't keep.\u201d Lewis grinned tiredly, amused slightly by James' seriousness.\u201cMade it this far haven't I?\u201d he mumbled as he fell asleep.\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0A few days later and he was out of hospital, standing in the car park, waiting for James to bring the car around to the front of the hospital. His leg hurt a lot more than it had when he first woke up. He supposed he was on stronger medication then. He was already annoyed at the crutches he had to use, unable to get the hang of them.He hobbled to James' car. The lad had attempted to drive up to the door but a last minute emergency meant that an ambulance had come screaming into the car park and James certainly wasn't going to cut in front. Lewis lowered himself gently into the seat and chucked the crutches in the back, with obvious distaste. James merely watched and then smirked.\u201cWhat Sergeant.\u201d\u201cNothing sir. I just never thought you'd be defeated by a simple crutch. They are supposed to be instruments designed to help, not hinder.\u201d\u201cHa bloody ha. You sodding try them then.\u201d James had merely continued smirking as he pulled out into the traffic.\u00a0Robbie never expected James to take him up on his word, playfully grabbing the crutches from the car before Lewis got a chance, and demonstrating to his superior, just how easy they were to use.\u201cAlright Jim, you've proved your point, you cheeky sod\u201d he said, as James managed to perform some sort of trick. \u201cIt's not a bloody BMX lad. Now give 'em back\u201d Hathaway laughed as he handed them back and as he settled into them, Lewis wondered again at how young James could look when he let himself be happy.\u201cComing in for a cuppa lad?\u201d Lewis grinned at the young man, \u201cAw sod it, I'll get us in a takeaway...s'least I can do.\u201d\u201cIf you're sure sir.\u201d\u201cYeah, wouldn't have offered else would I? You're going to have to go and pick it up mind.\u201d\u201cIf you're talking about that one on the corner of the high street, then I'd drive to hell and back to get hold of it. Their food is delicious\u201d\u201cNever tried it Jim, they really that good?\u201d\u201cSir...you haven't lived.\u201d\u00a0Lewis grinned as he made his way into the kitchen to start on the tea, letting James' chatter wash over him. By the time Hathaway had got the menu up on his phone and had read it out, Robbie's stomach was rumbling quite loudly. This food better be as good as James said it was.\u00a0Then again, the amount the normally quiet young man was talking about it, he had a feeling it would be.\n", "13": "\nChapter Text\n\"Sir, can I offer you a lift home tonight?\" James waited for an answer, knowing that his boss' car was in the garage after he'd managed to puncture two of the tyres in one day. Lewis wasn't getting his car back for another two days, the garage was busy.\"If its not too much trouble Hathaway, it'd be much appreciated.\" James returned Lewis' grin and shrugged.\"Less trouble that listening to you moaning about the buses tomorrow.\" Lewis punched him lightly in the shoulder before both men went back to their paperwork.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0At half past five Lewis got up and turned his computer off.\"Come on lad, if you're going to drop me home, the least I can do is not keep you here for as long as I normally would have.\" James picks up his jacket and follows the inspector outside.\u00a0They get into the car and straight away, James turns on the CD player. Within minutes, Madness comes blaring out of the speakers and James hastily rushes to turn the volume down. Lewis snorts in amusement and James turns to regard him for a second before pulling out into the road.\"What?...Sir, What?\"\"Nothing James. Just didn't see you being into Madness...far cry from your medieval madrigal whatsits.\"\"Ah well, there you go sir, you don't know everything about me\" He can almost see the 'Tell me about it'  written all over Lewis' face. He grins and then takes pity on the inspector.\"I can turn it off if you want sir.\"\"Nah Away man, I don't mind them...have you got 'One step Beyond' on this disc?\" James fiddles with the controls a few times and the voice of Chas Smash comes bursting into the car. James grins as he notices that Lewis' fingers are beating out a tattoo on the armrest in his passenger door.\u00a0There's been an incident or something, a fire the radio had told them earlier, that had made driving in Oxford tricky that afternoon. The one way system wasn't helping and both of the policemen decided to find a nice pub somewhere and have dinner, in the vague hope that the roads would be sorted by the time they were ready to leave.Unfortunately, everyone else had had the same idea, which was great for the publicans, but meant that Lewis and Hathaway had to drive a fair way before they found somewhere that had car parking space. Still, they eventually found a nice pub and sat outside, the warm weather meaning that they could comfortable sit in their jackets in the beer garden.\u00a0They talked while they ate, Lewis asking James about his plans for the weekend. Unsurprisingly, the younger man didn't have any, and Robbie found himself inviting James around to dinner. Before long, they'd planned to invite Jean and Laura as well and Lewis had managed to convince James that it was better if he cooked. After all, you could hardly invite your colleagues and friends over and then serve them a 'pierce and ping' roast dinner. James had agreed and Lewis had text Hobson and innocent just then, inviting them over on Saturday. That gave him and James 2 days to get hold of the ingredients. Well, it gave James two days for that. It gave lewis two days to make sure his flat was habitable.\u00a0After their dinner, they paid and James (who had been drinking orange juice all evening) turned to Robbie and told him that they'd better go and test the roads.Once they were in the car, Lewis went to turn the CD player on again, and James let him, but not before he'd turned the volume down further. After all, it was nearly ten in the night and James liked quieter driving the later it was.\u00a0The roads were quiet, as they headed back towards Oxford, which James liked, it meant he could drive quickly and confidently, without such a risk of hazards. Lewis appreciated his efficient driving, longing to get back to his bed. He also felt slightly guilty for agreeing to dinner, knowing full well that it meant James would get back even later than normal since he was dropping Lewis off. He looked across at the Sergeant, who was concentrating intensely on the apparently deserted upcoming roundabout. He was just about to say that James could drop him at the end of his street, save the lad having to come down it and then turn around, when he spotted something moving up the second left exit very fast. Robbie was shouting before he even registered what he had seen.\"JAMES WATCH OUT!\"It was too late, the speeding car slammed into the driver side of James' vehicle, shunting them off the roundabout and leaving the car rocking beside the road. His air bag had gone off in the collision and he batted it down angrily, adrenaline coursing through his system as he watched the offending car drive off, front bumper left behind on the road. He heard a groan and he immediately snapped around, fear for himself forgotten as a new, paralysing fear almost swamped him. Hathaway hadn't said anything.\u00a0He was somewhat relieved then, when he saw that Hathaway's eyes were open and the younger man was definitely breathing. Breathing too fast yes, but he was definitely breathing. His hands were still on the steering wheel and the knuckles had gone white. Come to think of it, the lad had gone an interesting shade of grey.\"James? Y'ok son?\" Hathaway didn't answer straight away and Lewis was suddenly worried that he'd misread what he'd originally seen, that his brain had tricked him into thinking that the sergeant was alive. But then James slowly took his hands off the wheel and mumbled.\"Think my right leg's broken sir. Are y-you oke?\" He sounded calm, but there was a shake in his voice that Lewis couldn't miss.\"Yeah, I'm fine...I'll call the ambulance James. Stay calm ok?\"\"Th-There's more sir...I...my n-neck...it really hurts.\" Lewis swore mentally. He knew what that could mean, he wasn't stupid. There was every possibility that his sergeant's neck was broken, or at the very least fractured.\"Ok...Ok, I'm going to get out of the car now Jim. I'm going to call an ambulance and then I'm going to report the incident. Its going to be fine ok. Just try and stay calm.\" Lewis talked as calmly as he could, aware from the speed that James was breathing and the wideness of his eyes that the younger man was on the verge of full-blown panic. James gave him a very shaky thumbs up, obviously too scared to move his neck.\u00a0Lewis didn't move too far away, staying close enough to the car that he'd hear if James spoke to him. At first he dialled an ambulance and explained the situation, being told that they'd bring a way to get him out of the car. Then he rang Innocent.\"Ma'am?\"\"Robbie? What is it? You're not still in the station are you?\"\"N-no. There's been an accident. I have to report a traffic accident.\" He gave the location of the crash and Innocent said that he was right to ring her and get it called in.\"What are you even doing there Robbie?\"\"Me and James, went for a pub dinner in order to avoid all the traffic.\" Another thought struck him and he walks over to the abandoned bumper of the other car that was involved. \"Tell uniform to look for this car.\" As he recites the plate, he looks over at James and he can see the panic in the younger man. He tries to give him a reassuring smile but he can hear his voice shaking as he gets to the end.\"Robbie? Robbie...How involved were you in this incident?\"\"Speeding car ma'am, smashed into James' car on the way...\"\"God, are you ok? James?\"\"I'm fine...I'm fine. I think James' leg is broken...\" He knows that his voice is giving away all his feelings, but he doesn't care.\"Robbie, there sounds like there's more.\"\"Y-yeah...Er...his neck hurts...Fuck...I think he's broken his neck ma'am.\"\"Bloody hell! Have you called the ambulance?\"\"Yeah. I-I don't know what to do. He's bloody scared Jean and, I'm not much better.\"\"Just sit there, stay in the car if it is safe, and keep an eye on Hathaway. I'll get a patrol car looking for the bastard that did it. You just sit tight and wait for the ambulance alright?\"\"Yes ma'am.\" Robbie ends the call and heads back into the car.\u00a0\"Jim?\"\"Sir?\"\"You ok?\"\"...No...\" Lewis sighs in his mind. Its never a good thing when James actually admits to not being alright.\"Does it hurt anywhere else?\"\"No just my leg and my n-neck sir.\" he looks so impossibly young as he tries valiantly to sound like he isn't terrified. Lewis reaches a hand out to grab the one of James' that's resting behind the gear stick.\"You're going to be alright kidda. Course you are. Paramedics'll soon patch you up, you'll see.\"\"M'scared\"\"Aye, I know lad. Me too. but it'll be ok.\" Lewis hears the sirens, a split second before the car starts to flash blue.\u00a0The paramedics rush out of the ambulance and head over to the car. The fire brigade arrive with them, bearing the tools needed to cut James out of the car. After 10 minutes of just him and Hathaway, Lewis can feel himself starting to panic. He's been holding it in for the boy's sake but there something about those metal cutters that sends the fear of God through him. It's like it only just hit him that James can't just get up and walk off. Like he's only just realised how serious this is, even though his mind has been screaming 'Broken neck!' at him for the last 8 minutes. Since Hathaway's terrified murmur.\u00a0He keeps hold of Hathaway's hand as the fire brigade start to cut away at the car. He keeps up a gentle litany of comforting words and noises as the paramedics move James out of the car, as they strap him onto a stretcher and fasten a neck brace into position. He doesn't wince when the ambulance goes over a bump in the road and James cries out, gripping his hand so hard that Robbie can almost feel his knuckles grinding together.\u00a0When they get to the hospital, he sits outside the operating theatre, and the room where they x-ray and scan people, without complaint waiting for the doctors to come and explain to him what's happening.\u00a0A doctor does eventually find him and let him know what's gone on, and then he's allowed into James' room.The lad looks so young it hurts. His leg is in plaster and he has a white neck brace on, that looks incredibly uncomfortable. Even asleep though, James is grimacing, and Robbie knows that ad has a tricky few weeks ahead of him. As this thought is crossing his mind, James' eyes flutter open.\"Sir?... What hap-...oh, yeah that\"\"James, how are you feeling kidda?\" He knows its a stupid question, the boy is clearly in pain.\"Hurts sir...\" There's something else, there's a lingering fear in James' eyes that Lewis knows needs to be addressed right now.\"You're ok son. Doctors say you've just got a nasty whiplash, necks not broken. Just your leg.\" James closes his eyes and takes a deep, shuddering breath.\"Thank fuck for that.\" he says quietly and then he grins. Lewis knows its a nervous grin, a release of emotion, but he doesn't care. Its good to see James smile.\"You're gonna have to keep that neck thingy on for a little bit though. And you're gonna need crutches.\"\"Better than spending the rest of my life unable to move sir. I think I'll deal.\" He pats James carefully on the shoulder and stands up to leave.\"I'll come and get you when they let you out lad. My car'll be fixed by then.\"\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0That Saturday, James is relaxing on the sofa (as much as you can when you can't move your neck and you leg is slowly throbbing anyway) and watching television when the front doorbell goes. He sighs and struggles upright, reaching for the crutches that's he's reliant on for the next few weeks.\u00a0Opening the door, he sees Jean, Laura and Robbie stood on his doorstep, each holding a bag. Everyone of the bags has droplets of water on the inside and steam rising from them, a sure sign that the contents are warm. As if the smell of a mixture of Indian and Thai food wasn't a give-away. Laura speaks first;\"We figured it'd be unfair to make you cook while you were injured and you could probably do with the company.\" James laughs and steps back to let them in. Jean and Laura head straight for the kitchen to get plates and cutlery, relieving Robbie of the bag he was carrying as they go. Robbie hangs back to help James close the door, crutches not being conducive to that particular activity.\"You ok Jim?\" He asks, feigning nonchalance, trying to cover up the concern in his eyes.\"Yeah. Hurts and all, but I'm ok sir. Be even better once I've eaten.\" He looks towards the kitchen as he hears the ladies laughing about something and smiles.\"Thanks...for this...its nice and...I appreciate it.\" Robbie smiles, its adorable how awkward the younger man is.\"No worries kidda. Laura and Jean agreed that just 'cause you got injured, didn't mean we couldn't come and invade your house.\" He puts his arm on James' back and watches as the sergeant, swings himself into the kitchen. Robbie has to admit, he's gotten pretty good at those crutches.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Two hours later, and the meal has long since been eaten. A mixture of food, warmth and painkillers means that Hathaway has fallen asleep on the sofa. Robbie and Laura go back into the kitchen to wash up the dishes that they all used. One less thing for James to have to do in the morning. They figured it wouldn't be easy for the man to balance on one leg and wash up without the man moving his neck as well.\u00a0Jean finds a cushion and slides it gently under Hathaway's head, his neck is already hurting, it wouldn't do for him to get a crick in it on top. James shifts a little, mumbling something incoherent and Jean smiles, the sergeant hasn't looked more like a child to her. Robbie and Laura come back in and Laura moves his crutches to within easy reach for when he wakes up. Anod from Robbie and Jean pulls the throw over James, all three of them grin as he instantly brings a hand up to curl over the top of it.\u00a0They leave soon after, making sure that his painkillers are in easy reach too.\u00a0When James wakes up in the morning, his leg hurting, and sees the crutches and painkillers put within arms length of him, he smiles. And makes a mental note that he owes all three of his friends a drink or two.\n", "14": "\nChapter Text\nAll this James falling asleep on his sofa business has to stop. Mainly because, since Creavecour, Robbie is finding that he almost doesn't have the heart to wake James up when a call comes in.\u00a0The lad looks young when he's asleep. His carefully constructed wall of knowledge and dry wit come tumbling down and he becomes that twelve year old boy again.\u00a0In sleep, all of James' defences dissolve. His facial expressions are free to dance across his face and Robbie can tell just how badly the latest case has effected him. He suspects that James doesn't know this, he suspects that if he did, the boy would be a lot more careful where he laid his head.\u00a0Still, he felt honoured that Hathaway feels safe enough to fall asleep in his presence. Of course, sometimes the younger man is so exhausted that he can't help it. That had been the case after Zoe Kenneth's attempt on his life. James had looked ok outside the hospital, he'd looked fine \u2013 but for the cut on his cheek, you'd never have known anything had happened. The story had been different however, once Robbie had driven him back to his flat. The lad had dropped onto his sofa and mumbled something about Lewis helping himself to a cup of tea, 'Or something stronger if you like sir?\" Robbie had declined, opting to make tea, he was going to be driving home after all.\u00a0Once he'd finished making them a cuppa, he'd headed back into the living room, only to find Hathaway slumped onto the arm of the sofa. The lad's breathing had settled into a steady rhythm and he was clearly fast asleep. The expression on his face however, spoke of anything but sweet dreams. Hathaway's haunted looking face softened a little when Lewis pulled a blanket over him and immediately, James shifted to accommodate the new found comfort. Its been three years since then and here they are again, James asleep on his sofa after a case that he hasn't quite come to terms with.\u00a0He contemplates that James looks like a child when he sleeps. One hand curled around the top of the blanket and one balled into a loose fist by his nose, the knuckle of his thumb resting on his bottom lip. His head was tucked in slightly and his knees drawn up to make his gangly body lie in a loose 'z' shape.\u00a0It is easy to see the inner child in James Hathaway while he sleeps, and sometimes, Robbie gets an inkling that James doesn't sleep as well in his own flat as he does in Lewis'. Why else would the kid fall asleep so readily on his sofa, and be so reluctant to go home after a tough case?\u00a0So when the call comes in to attend another murder, another life lost in a meaningless and probably exceedingly violent way, sometimes Robbie considers leaving the lad asleep on his couch. He considers giving James a couple of hours more of innocence before he has to face the horrors of the job they do every day.\u00a0But he always wakes him up. Not only because he knows that James' won't appreciate being treated like a child even when he looks like one, but because he doesn't want to go out to the scene and leave the lad to wake up alone.\u00a0He suspects that James Hathaway has woken up alone too many times in his young life. Robbie wonders if any one was there to sooth him after childish nightmares relinquished their grip. He rather thinks not and this makes Lewis both angry and sad. Someone should have been there for the child that James was and still is in many ways. He should never been left to get on with it alone.\u00a0Robbie'll be damned if he lets it happen to the lad again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n", "15": "\nChapter Text\nLewis and Hathaway were walking back from the pub when James saw it. They hadn't been drinking much. They'd only had one beer each, neither man really in the mood to drink after the case they'd just wrapped up. A man had killed his baby by accident and then when his wife had cracked under the initial interrogation, he'd killed her as well. So although they got a result...they didn't feel good about it. James was still coming to terms with the idea that a man could kill his child. Hathaway had dealt badly with his visit to the crime scene, finding it difficult to be in the same room as the child's body. Laura had advised that he didn't come to the post mortem and Lewis heartily agreed. He needed James brains on this case, and a shell-shocked and angry James was not a clear thinking man.\u00a0So as it was, they were walking back through town and James stopped, frowning as he looked at the roof of the houses opposite.\"Sir...does that look like...does that look like a\"\"Fire?\" finished Lewis.\"Yeah. Shit, call the...\" James was all ready off, running through one of Oxford's ancient back alleys to get to the next street. As they ran, Lewis dialled 999 and called the fire brigade, giving the address of the street that they were currently running down.They skidded to a stop as they arrived outside the blazing house. A man across the street ran over to them. James turned to him.\"What happened? We saw the smoke from the other street. Robbie called the fire brigade on the way\"\"Dunno mate, there was some sort of explosion. I came out of me house-\" Lewis interrupted the man.\"You live on this street? Do you know who lives there?\" The man went pale.\"Oh God. Mrs...Mrs Kerman. Mrs Kerman and her sister...I think her sister's staying with her.\" Lewis and Hathaway exchanged a look and Robbie could see in the young sergeant's eyes exactly what he was thinking. There's been too much death today, I've got to try and prevent this.\"Jim...Jim no, you don't know what you're doing.\"\"Sir! The fire engine might not get here for another ten minutes.\"\"James! Its too dangerous.\"\"Didn't stop you did it...And honestly, if someone had told you not to go in after me, would you have listened?\" Lewis couldn't answer and Hathaway nodded as he shrugged his jacket off. \"Just call an ambulance, we might need one.\"\"She might not even be in there James!\" Lewis shouted desperately after his sergeant, but Hathaway had already entered the burning building. Nonetheless, he called an ambulance. He considered going in after Hathaway, but he could see that the man who had met them was shaking and Lewis knew that he couldn't leave him alone. Besides, what good would he be? He's not as young as he was, he was at least three years younger last time he had run into a fire to save someone.Just then, a car pulled into the road and a young woman got out.\"What's...What's going on? D-Doreen...Oh my word...DOREEN!\" Lewis grabbed her as she started to run towards the house.\"Easy love, my sergeant's gone in there to find her. Are you her sister?\"\"Y-Yeah, I'm st-staying with her for the weekend. What happened?\"\"We don't know. James spotted the smoke and we...there's a fire engine and an ambulance on its way Miss. Just try and calm down.\" He turned around slightly to the neighbour they'd talked to before. \"Could you make her a cuppa mate? Lots of milk and sugar eh?\" The man nodded and he rushed back to his house to carry out the request and Lewis guided the woman down to the kerb and sat her down. While he was looking after her, he was worrying marginally less about Hathaway.\u00a0*********************************************************\u00a0James ran into the house, coughing almost as soon as he did so. The rooms were filled with acrid smoke and there were flames licking at the furniture. Hathaway could feel the heat rolling off the fire. He quickly searched the bottom floor and didn't find any people. He could feel the warm air in his lungs and he suddenly realised just how stupid he was being...just how stupid Lewis had been to run into Zoe Kenneth's house after him. His brow furrowed as he started to climb up the stairs. It was getting hard to breath and he knew if he didn't find Mrs Kerman soon, he'll be in no state to rescue her. He briefly curses himself as he realises that if he doesn't get out, Lewis is going to come in after him and suffer the same fate. He sees flashing blue lights and knows that either the fire brigade or the ambulance has arrived. At the top of the landing, he sees a woman's shoe in the bedroom floor and forges towards the lady, glad that it only seems to be smoke and not fire up here. He kneels down to the lady, coughing, scared for a moment that he may be bringing his lungs up. James started to drag her out, hoping against hope that he stayed conscious for long enough to get them both to the clear, outside air. He was seriously worried about the fact that Mrs Kerman was unconscious, that she had probably been in that position since the fire started.\u00a0He finally got her out of the front door and pulled her across the street, gasping for breath as the paramedics took her out of his hands. Lewis ran over to him as he started to try and get back into the building.\"James?...Sergeant! What are you doing?\"\"...The...the sister.\" James panted, breath coming in short, sharp gasps.\"She's here, she wasn't in the house, She's there, sat on the kerb.\" James nodded slightly as he realised that there was no one else in the house. Meanwhile, the fire service had arrived and were starting to tackle the blaze. As they stood watching, Lewis realised that the paramedics were performing CPR on Mrs Kerman. He tried to guide James away, remembering the look on the younger man's face when they had lost the battle to save Jane Templeton. It as too late, James had noticed and his jaw was working as his chest heaved. As Lewis turned around again to look, he saw the paramedics sake their heads and sit back on their heels, a mixture of resignation and sadness on their faces. He could hear the keening wail of Doreen Kerman's sister as she realised that Doreen was dead.Expecting to see blankness on Hathaway's face, Robbie was surprised to see desperation and anguish there.James started to back off slightly, before turning and walking slowly back up the road. Whatever he was expecting, it wasn't this. It wasn't James just walking away, head bowed and steps unsteady. Robbie set off after him, finally reaching the lad and putting a hand on his shoulder. It was angrily shoved off with a subdued mutter. Lewis wasn't having it. They were nearly at the end of the street and Robbie grabbed Hathaway and spun him around to face him. He was shocked to see that there were tears streaming down the sergeant's face, although he wasn't making a sound.\"Jim?\"\"NO! Don't try and...just no.\"\"It wasn't your fault.\"\"Of course it WAS! I didn't get her out in time, I was too slow, I dunno. But I didn't save her!\" James is talking fast, taking quick, shallow breaths. Lewis recognises the panic and guilt that the younger man is displaying. He's seen it before. Last time he saw Hathaway in this state, he'd told the sergeant to get out of his sight and he'd later had to save his life. The lad was verging on hysterical and Lewis could tell from his pupils and his breathing that he really should be seeing a medic.\"James calm down. Look, it wasn't your fault, you have no way of knowing if you'd have been able to save her if we got there any quicker.\"\"You don't know that.\"\"And you don't not know it! Christ Jim, the state of the world isn't your fault you know?\"\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\"Look, life is shit kidda. That's just the way it goes. Some people live to a hundred, some people don't make it past their teenage years. There are some people who die in their sleep, and there are some people who die in house fires. You can't save them all.\"\"...You saved me.\" James looks at the floor. \"Its just...all of that and she still...fuck.\" Robbie guides James to sit down by the roadside, aware that James still isn't breathing like he should be. Lewis puts an arm around him, both for comfort, and to stop him doubling over as he coughs violently.\"You need to see a doctor lad.\"\"I'm fine. Just smoke in my lungs that's all.\"\"Don't be an idiot son. You can barely breathe Jim. Come on, we'll get the paramedics to have a look at you.\" Lewis said in a tone that clearly said 'We'll talk later...right now you need medical help and I'm going to see you get it.'James merely nodded dejectedly as he let the inspector lead him towards the ambulance. As they got there, Mrs Kerman's sister approached them, eyes puffy and red. James looked straight ahead, scared to look the grieving woman in the eye. Lewis started to apologise for him, but the lady silenced him by putting a hand on James arm.\"Thank you.\"\"For what?\" the sergeant said bitterly, \"I failed didn't I?\" The dead woman's sister looked at him sadly.\"Maybe...But you tried. That means a lot.\" Lewis nodded at her as she walked past, grateful that she didn't blame James, he wasn't sure if the younger man could take any blame. They got to the doors of the ambulance and Lewis prodded and helped James into the back of it.\"He went in and got the dead woman. The stupid idiot says he's fine but he can't catch his breath.\" The paramedic nodded, getting Hathaway to sit in the chair, since the bed was taken with Mrs Kerman's body. Lewis climbed in behind him. The paramedic took one look at James struggling to take a breath and secured a oxygen mask over the young man's head, before closing the doors of the ambulance. He banged on the cab.\"Shake a leg Charlie. The JR, quick as you like.\" Lewis didn't like the sound of that, but he didn't say anything, realising that the paramedics knew what they were doing and him badgering information out of them wasn't going to help.\u00a0It took two minutes and twenty nine seconds for it all to catch up with James. Whether it was the fact that he was within touching distance of the woman he'd tried so hard to save, or because he had finally realised that he was sat in the back of an ambulance finding it hard to breath, but either way it hit him square in the face. Lewis looked up from his hands as he heard the paramedic muttering words to his sergeant. James had his head in his hands and was letting out shuddering sobs, clearly trying to control them but failing miserably. The ambulance technician looked to Lewis, eyebrows raised.\"Try and calm him down mate. He's had too much smoke in his lungs. This really isn't helping him.\" Robbie's eyes widened and he crouched in front of James, taking both of his shoulders.\"Hey, c'mon now kidda. Stop this eh? You weren't to blame Jim. You know you weren't...deep down you know you did everything you could.\"\"...not...enough...\" Lewis is fully aware that its not only the tears making his sergeant find it difficult to speak. He just hopes that James' lungs aren't permanently damaged.\"That's no way to think. Like her sister said. You tried. That's already enough James. There are other people that wouldn't have even attempted to go in that house.\"\"Fat lot...of...good...it ...did\"\"You can't save everyone kid. You just can't. \"\"Should be able...to...fucking...unfair other...otherwise.\"\"Life is Jim, life is.\" Hathaway laughs bitterly and rests his head back against some instrument panel, but at least he has calmed down. He's no longer hyperventilating or crying, although there are still tears drying on his cheeks.\u00a0When they get to the hospital, James is wheeled off to have tests done on his lungs and breathing rates and all sorts of other things that Robbie didn't really understand.When he is finally allowed to see Hathaway, the young man is lying in a hospital bed, unconscious and unresponsive. There is a tube feeding oxygen into his nose and an IV drip running into the back of his hand. He's staring at the clip on the lad's left index finger, which is monitoring his heart rate and pulse and all his vital signs. Its while he's staring that a nurse takes pity on him and comes to explain that James had been sedated, that he hasn't jut collapsed. The nurse explains that they needed to sedate Hathaway in order for him to get some proper rest so that his lungs could start to fix themselves. Lewis nods and sits down by the bed, wondering whether he should phone Innocent and let her know that James isn't coming into work tomorrow. He decides that he should, but it takes him a good ten minutes to get around to it.\u00a0Three days later, he picks James up from the hospital and drives him home. The lad still has a nasty cough, but he is breathing a lot more like he should be. He's been ordered to take a week off work and Lewis has had to tell Innocent so that she makes him stay at home. They don't mention what happened and James seems to be fine, if a little bit breathless.\u00a0Lewis know that this isn't right, that James is still guilt-tripping himself inside. He doesn't say anything though. He knows its futile. The boy will come to him in time. It may be days, weeks, months, even years; but eventually, James will talk to him. And until then, he'll just have to keep an eye on the lad.\n", "16": "\nChapter Text\nJames was leaning on the car as he left Richie McGuire's house. He looked uncomfortable and for a moment Robbie is confused. As he gets closer though, James speaks and all is explained.\"How big?\" It only takes a split second for Lewis to realise that Hathaway means the spider, someone must have told him. Robbie holds his hand out and makes a vaguely spidery shape with it.\"Oh Jesus!\" Robbie grins as James turns away in disgust, he's started to get a handle on what's bugging the younger man.\"I don't have to take it into custody or anything do I?\" Lewis just smirks. James isn't going to come out and admit he's scared, rather, he's covering up his anxiety by making quips.\"I hope it isn't indigenous to Oxfordshire, the Chief Constable wouldn't like that.\" Lewis humours him, pretends to ignore the fact that James is obviously less than happy with this turn of events.\"I wanna know if this particular creature comes from Venezuela.\"\"Yeah well, get someone to interview it other than me.\" That's an obvious expression of dislike. He can comment now, its clear exactly what James means by that.\"Arachnophobe Hathaway?\"\"Card-carrying sir.\" That's as close to an outright 'yes' as he's ever going to get from James.\"So was Jo Race...but who knew that?\" He doesn't miss the fact that James blows his cheeks out as they walk along and he wonders what state the younger man would be in if he came face to face with a spider, since the mere mention of them seems to considerably unsettle him. They walk towards the pond and the further they get from the house (and the spider) the more relaxed and back to himself James seems to get. And once James is back on form, it doesn't take long for his words to spark something deep in Lewis' brain that sends him rushing back into the house to confront the handy man.\u00a0He is glad that James doesn't notice the glass on the side on the room. He's really not sure how to cope with James having a panic attack as he suspects he would if actually clapped eyes on the Salmon pink Tarantula that was less than five feet from him and his arachnophobic sergeant.\u00a0*************************************************\u00a0Its a few days after the case and they are relaxing at James' flat. They've been drinking a little but its fine, since they have a day off the next day. Whatever mindless weekend drivel that they have on has just stopped for an advert break and Lewis gets up slowly.\"Sir? You don't have to go...I'll sleep on the sofa.\"\"Eh? I was going for a leak James..\"\"Oh. Er, well the offer still stands.\"\"Cheers Lad. But I'm not taking your bed, I'll kip on the sofa.\"\"Your back?\"\"Will survive a night on the sofa kid.\" With that, Lewis leaves to go to the bathroom, pondering on the fact that his sergeant doesn't seem to want to be alone.\u00a0Lewis is just washing his hands when something moves in the corner of his eye. There's a spider scuttling across the bathtub. Its not really a big one. All tiny body and long, spindly legs. If this was his flat, he'd leave it, not bothered by the uninvited house guest. But this is James' flat and he knows now, that if James sees this in the morning, he's in danger of having a heart attack. So he catches it in his hands and goes to eject it from the premises. Its then that he realises that there is no window in James' bathroom. Its cold outside and he knows that all of James' windows will be shut. He could attempt to open one, but then he's most likely to drop and lose the spider. Knowing like he does about how much James doesn't like them, he can't just leave the spider in the lad's flat.\"Ja-mes?\" Robbie shouts through the flat.\"Yes?\" James replies in a tone that suggests that he is slightly worried about what is coming next.\"Do us a favour lad and open your living room window.\" He doesn't wait for a reply before continuing; \"Then stand away from it.\" He gets a very confused 'Ok' from James and he waits until he hears the window open before he moves into the living room.\u00a0The confused look is wiped from James' face as Lewis enters the room and the sergeant's finely honed detective skills jump to the obvious conclusion as to what Robbie holds in his hand.\"How big? Where was?- Actually I don't wanna know.\"\"Its only a littl'un Jim. Just figured you wouldn't want it watching you pee.\" The colour drains out of James' face and Robbie hasn't failed to notice that James has backed into the corner or the room. He also sees the minute dilation of the lad's pupils as he realises that Robbie and therefore the spider are between him and the door. Deciding that he probably wasn't far off about the likelihood of a panic attack, he quickly throws the spider out of the window with a quiet 'Sorry little fella' and then shuts the said window, ensuring that the spider won't get in again.Its only when Robbie sits down again that James relaxed enough to come and sit down as well. He gave his sergeant a sidelong glance, seeing that the colour was returning to James' cheeks, but the younger man's eyes were periodically darting about the room, to all the places it would be likely to find a spider.\"You really don't like them do you son?\" James shook his head.\"Wasn't joking when I said 'card-carrying' sir.\"\"I can see that Jim. Any particular reason?\"\"Apart from the fact that they have eight legs and eight eyes, isn't that reason enough?\"\"Squid's do as well, well the legs anyway, are you scared of them?\" James shook his head in response.\"So what's the difference then?\" James glared at him. \"I'm not having a pop at you lad, I just want to understand that's all.\" The sergeant sighed, realising that Lewis was never going to let this drop.\"The difference sir, is that I've never been surrounded by hundred's of squid. Also they swim and don't crawl all over people.\" Lewis raises his eyebrow in a manner that clearly indicates he is intrigued and James resignedly starts to recount the tale.\u00a0*************************************************\u00a0\nThey were all playing in the woods that were at the back of the estate. Paul had found an old shed there when he'd been looking for a good sword stick. He'd told James, Scarlett and another boy Mike, that James and Paul went to school with. James had never really liked Mike, not trusting him. No where near as much as he did Paul. But Mike had a good imagination and it made the teams more even when they played at sword fighting. So they had all traipsed into the woods behind Paul, excited at the prospect of a new place to play. \n\u00a0\nEventually, they reached the shed and Paul stopped them. \n\n\"I couldn't get the door open last time. One of you will have to do it.\" Scarlett pouted.\n\n\"I'm the princess, princesses don't open doors. We get the knights to do it for us.\" Mike looked warily at the door.\n\n\"How do we know it won't fall over...it might even be locked.\" Paul nodded his agreement. James sighed in that way that kids do when they think every one else is being silly.\n\n\"Let me try. Us knights are good at this sort of thing you know.\" He pulled the stick from his belt and jammed it in the door jamb, heaving with all his might. He was so engrossed in the effort, he didn't see Mike pull Paul to one side and whisper in his ear. He also didn't see Paul shake his head sadly, or see Mike threaten to hit him.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, with a loud crack, the door flew open and James fell backwards. Scarlett held out a hand to help him up and they all peered inside. The shed was damp and dusty and had obviously not been used for a number of years. But since there was a hole in the roof, it was relatively light in there.\n\n\"Some one has to go in and investigate.\"\n\n\"Not me, I'm a-\"\n\n\"Princess, yeah we know\" the boys chorused. They all looked at each other uncertainly, no one wanting to put themselves forward. After a while James spoke.\n\n\"I'll go. But you have to keep a watch for pirates and wolves...and ghosts\" he added as an after thought. The other three children nodded and James held his stick out in front of him as if it really were the sword he imagined it to be.\n\u00a0\nHe advanced slowly, not wanting to let his apprehension show, but not wanting run headlong into danger, even if he knew there wasn't really anything in there that could pose a proper threat. His child mind hadn't even considered the possibility that the wooden structure was unsound. It was lucky for him that it wasn't. No sooner was he in the middle of the room, when the door slammed shut behind him. He immediately rushed back to it, sword stick dropped forgotten on the floor.\n\n\"Hey...HEY! This isn't funny. Let me out!\" He rattled the door handle and his fear increased slightly as it didn't budge.\n\n\"Mike?..Scarlett?...PAUL?\" James shouted. He froze as he saw a dark shape moving on the door. The spider crawled down towards his hand and he jumped back, tripping as he did so. His hand connected with some planks of wood that were stood against the wall. He screamed as a big, brown spider scuttled across his leg and he could see where he'd dislodged more, another five leaving the wood pile and heading in different directions.\n\n\"LET ME OUT!\" he shouted, unable to keep the fear from his voice. He started to pound on the door, the spider he had seen there forgotten. He could hear talking outside and he was sure he heard Mike laugh. Paul was saying something but James couldn't make out what it was. Scarlett was saying something too and she sounded angry.\n\n\"Please? Let me out. I'm...There's spiders in here. Loads of them. As big as my hand.\" He'd noticed three more while he was saying this to them. \n\n\"I HATE YOU ALL! OPEN THE DOOR\" James didn't care if they heard the break in his voice any more, he just wanted to get out of the arachnid ridden shed and go home. He heard Scarlett reply;\n\n\"It was Mike, he's run away. Me and Paul can't get the door open James\" His panic increased tenfold and he started to cry.\n\n\"I don't like it in here Scarlett. I want to get out, can't you break the door down?\"\n\n\"No. I'm-\"\n\n\"You're not. Not really a princess, just try.\"\n\n\"I can't James. Paul's gone to get an adult.\" James sat down on the floor. It was then that he noticed the huge spider in the corner of the room. James was convinced it was a tarantula, like he'd read about in his animal book. He'd thought they were cool before. But pictures in a book were different to the real thing.\n\n\"There's-There's a tarantula in here Scarlett. I-Its gonna eat me!\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid James, you only get tarantula's in zoo's\"\n\n\"Na-uh, you get them in sheds as well, I'm looking at one.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, Paul's back with your mum.\"James stood up again, shuddering as the spider in the corner moved closer to him.\n\n\"MUM!\"\n\n\"Hang on James, just hang on a minute, we'll get you out.\"\n\u00a0\nFive minutes later, James was in his mother's embrace, covered in dirt, dust and cobwebs. There was a graze on his hand and elbow where he'd tripped and he was crying unabashedly.\n\n\"Shush now baby. Its ok.\" James rubbed his eye and nodded as his mother carried him back to their house, with Scarlett and Paul following behind. Between hiccuping sobs, James recounted the story to his parents while his mother made juice for them all. \n\u00a0\nThree days later when Mike mysteriously acquired a bruise on his face while they were out playing, none of the children would say how it'd happened. And if Mrs Hathaway guessed, her son went unpunished.\n\u00a0*************************************************\u00a0Lewis gives a low whistle as James finishes telling the story.\"How old were you Jim?\"\"...Eight.\"\"Can imagine that was pretty scary, certainly goes some way to explaining things any how.\"\"Yeah...So now you know sir. I really don't like them.\"\"I can see that kidda. What happened to Mike?\"\"He stopped coming to visit. I think Scarlett might have scared him off. If me trying to bash his head off didn't already do that.\" Lewis takes all this in and he feels almost sad for the little eight year old Hathaway that he never knew. A thought occurs to him.\"Are you scared of sheds then?\" James rolls his eyes.\"No. Only the spiders in them.\"\"...I was only asking\" Lewis says, grinning. \"I dunno about you lad, but I could do with some kip.\" James gets off the sofa.\"Honestly sir, would you prefer the bed? The sofa really isn't that comfortable and what with your back...\"\"You're not going to let this drop until I cave in are you?\" James shakes his head, a smirk on his face.\"You wouldn't either if you had to listen to you moaning about your back all day at work.\" Robbie chuckles.\"Point taken James, point taken. Thank you.\"\"No problem sir\" he says and they say their goodnights.\u00a0Before he falls asleep, James wonders if DI Knox would ever have removed a spider for him like Lewis did without being asked. He very much doubts it, he had never asked Knox back to his flat.\u00a0Robbie lies awake remembering his Lyn waking him up at three in the morning to get a spider out of her room. He remembers that he couldn't find it and he'd only pretended to catch it in order to put her mind at rest. That had come back to bite him in the arse when it had been found the next morning the wall above Val's head.\u00a0He rather suspects that James would have screamed louder than Val did. \u00a0\n", "17": "\nChapter Text\nHathaway leaned back in the chair, pulling his cigarettes from his pocket. He tapped the tip of it on the side of the box, before putting it in his mouth and lighting it smoothly.Lewis looked up from his pint with a barely suppressed frown, and Laura glared at him. James was oblivious, eyes closed in bliss.\"Its just a relief of withdrawal symptoms you know.\" Laura was staring at him, and this time, he saw it.\"What?\"\"That happy feeling you're getting, its just your body getting a break from the cravings.\"\"I'm aware of that doctor. People have been telling me that since I was fifteen.\"\"Doesn't it worry you?\" Lewis watched the verbal fencing, aware that Laura was fighting a losing battle, he'd told James about smoking enough times, the younger man paid him no heed. Either way, he's not getting involved.\"Doesn't what worry me Laura?\", James replies, a hint of irritation in his voice.\"What you're doing to yourself. You must know how bad that is for you.\" She jabs a finger towards the cigarette in his mouth and James sighs.\"Yes I do know. And no. It doesn't worry me. Look at the job I do. Could get shot, stabbed, kidnapped, anything. A ciggie is the last thing I've got to deal with.\"\"Yes, but you won't be doing this job forever James. One day, you're going to be sixty odd, and retired. If you make it that far. And the way you're going, if you do make it to sixty, you're not going to be able to walk more than ten feet without needing to stop for breath.\" He starts to interrupt her but she cuts him off.\"That's assuming that you're not stuck in your house, hooked up to an oxygen tank.\" James' mouth thins and sets in a line.\"Its a chance I'll have to take then isn't it? I have tried to give up before you know Laura. I've tried just going cold turkey, I've tried those self help tapes, hell I've even tried that bloody chewing gum. And I hate chewing gum!\"\"James-\" Lewis says, in an attempt to defuse the rapidly escalating situation, but he is stopped by James.\"Leave it. Look, I appreciate that you care, really I do. But you're not my bloody mother Laura! I'm big enough to make my own bloody decisions, this is one of them.\" Hathaway drained his glass and left, leaving Robbie and Laura sat in the beer garden.\u00a0\"So...that went well\", Lewis says carefully.\"Bloody idiot.\" She shakes her head, \"Why didn't you say anything Robbie? He'd listen to you.\" Robbie snorts incredulously.\"Me? Laura, where have you been? He never bloody listens to me, not about stuff like that. We've had this conversation so many times that I can't count. At the end of the day, he's a grown man.\" Laura turns to look at him, disapproval on her face.\"Robbie, I've seen an inordinate amount of smokers corpses. I do not want our James going the same way.\"\"I know, I know. Neither do I, but what can ya do? He's thirty three not fifteen.\" Laura sighs. Then an idea forms into her head.\"You still working on that suspicious death in Thrupp, or did it get given to Grainger?\"\"Nah, still ours to puzzle over. The smoking, gambling, drinking thug. I'd have thought everyone wanted to do him in.\"\"Right. So I'm showing you the post mortem then?\"Yep, 'Fraid so\"They stay there for a little while, finishing their drinks, and then they leave. Lewis has a feeling that Laura is planning something, but he doesn't know what. He should warn James really, that's what friends are for. But then again, friends save each others lives and maybe, just maybe, they'd manage to save James'.\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0The next day, they are both sat in the office. Conversation hasn't really been flowing. Suddenly James looks up decisively.\"I'm sorry sir, about yesterday.\" Lewis starts to tell him that its not really Lewis that James should be apologising too, but his phone rings. Laura.\"Hello doctor.\"\"Lewis. Got your post mortem ready. I need you down here, quick as.\"\"Ok, give us twenty minutes\". He looks at James.\"We're needed down at the morgue.\"\u00a0Twenty-three minutes later, they are both stood in Laura's lab, staring down at the corpse of Mr Gerald Fisher, late of this parish.\"As you can see gentlemen, he wasn't in the best of health. Drank, smoked and poisoned his body on regular occasions.\" James is looking slightly sick, and even Lewis is looking less than comfortable.\"He was stabbed, in the liver and stomach around 3 or 4 times, its hard to be sure. That was the cause of death. He bled out internally as well as externally, wouldn't have taken long. The head wound was probably caused by him falling over, due to feeling woozy and light-headed as a result of blood loss.\" Lewis sighs.\"Doctor, you told us all this at the scene, what is the point of this little excersise.\" Hobson grins, and its not a happy one. Its a grim, evil grin and suddenly, both Lewis and Hathaway feel uncomfortable.\"The point inspector is organs.\"\"Organs?\" James says, swallowing.\"Organs indeed.\" Laura pulls a cloth off a nearby trolley and reveals a heart, liver and lungs on the table.\"His heart, funnily enough, wasn't in that bad shape considering his lifestyle, still had a good few years in it.\" She pokes the stomach liver with the blunt end of her scalpel. \"Apart from the stab wounds, this was ok, although the drink was taking its toll.\" Lewis sighed, he knew where this was going now. Laura beckoned to Hathaway.\"Come here sergeant\"\"I can see fine from here Doctor.\" She narrowed her eyes at him.\"Here, now!\" James actually looks shocked, Lewis suppresses a grin. But Hathaway does indeed stand next to Laura, trying not to look at the trolley.\"What's that sergeant?\" Laura asks, pointing at a lump of black flesh. James gives it a cursory glance, before speaking.\"I dunno, I was never very good at anatomy at school.\" Laura frowns.\"I do not believe you James, but I will enlighten you nonetheless. That, is a pair of lungs. You will observe that they are black and the edges are frayed slightly.\" James nods slightly.\"Yes. Don't look all that good.\"\"That James, is because they aren't. They are the lungs of a smoker.\" He rolls his eyes, and Robbie can't help but look in horrified fascination.\"Laura-\" James starts. She stops him. Laura strips off her gloves, standing away from the trolley. She splays her hand across his chest gently and quietly addresses him.\"Your lungs James, they probably look something like that.\" He swallows again and looks at the lungs lying on the trolley.\"You only get one pair James, and they can let you down at the drop of a hat. You're on a slippery slope to oxygen dependence, emphysema and lung cancer. I just thought you should know. See it for yourself.\"\"I appreciate your concern Laura but-\"\"James, I'm not doing this because I'm trying to mother you, or harass you. Robbie doesn't nag you about it because he wants to make life difficult.\"\"Then why?\"\"Are you really that stupid James? Smoking kills, slowly and silently and I see this 50% of the time I open up a corpse. We go on at you James, because you are a good friend and...\" James just stares at her, unused to the gentle, sad voice she's using.\"Dammit James, we don't want to lose you.\" James is speechless and Robbie would find it funny if there wasn't water in his sergeant's eyes. He really didn't think that they would be concerned for his health. Time for Robbie himself to make some contribution.\"James, all we're asking, is for you to look at those lungs there, and just...just try again to give up. For us lad, if not for yourself?\" James does nothing for a few minutes, except stare at the damaged organs in front of him. Then he nods silently. Laura smiles softly and Lewis pats him on the back.\"Come on kidda, we'll go get some lunch eh? Coming Laura?\"\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0Three weeks later and James is doing well, he's only had two cigarettes in those 21 days. He has to admit, albeit grudgingly, that he does feel healthier in himself. His breathing is better, and he hadn't even noticed that it'd got worse.\u00a0He's grateful to Laura Hobson for managing to scare him shitless enough to take action. He knows what his life could have ended like, and how much shorter it could have been.\u00a0He'll never give her the satisfaction of knowing that though. He knows she'd milk it to the highest degree.\n", "18": "\nChapter Text\nIn Hathaway's spare room, there was a box.\nIts an unassuming box, plain cardboard, coming up to his knee. The word 'Privit' is written across the side in a childish, messy scrawl, the words.; 'James' box, keep owt' written equally messily underneath. The top bears the message 'Fragile', written in a much neater hand, its owner has obviously learnt to spell since writing his declaration of box ownership.\nIt was a box of things that he held close, things that meant something to him. His comfort blanket from when he was a baby. A toy car, that he'd dropped from the top of the folly once, when Father Michael had taken him and Paul up there after their persistent begging. When he looks at that car, he can remember seeing the estate spread before him and thinking to himself that he'd get out from the shadow of the big house, make it in the big wide world.\nThere's an essay he wrote aged 11, the first one he got full marks for. It reminds him of what he used to be, of how much he used to care.\nThere's an 18th birthday card from his aunt, given to him three weeks before she died. She was one of the only people that ever believed in him. Despite losing her faith, she'd never discouraged his, being happy for him when he told her he was going to join the seminary.\nAfter that card, James hadn't put anything else in his box. Nothing much seemed to be worthy of going in.\nUntil three days after his twenty eighth birthday.\nHe'd been sent to the airport that day, somewhat reluctantly. Now when he looks back, he can't imagine what his life would have been like had he not gone. It would be lacking so many things; purpose, meaning. More than that, he'd be lacking a best friend. The man he met that day, has no idea how much of an impact he has had on James' life, no idea how many times a kind word saved him from doing something stupid, how many times a gentle hand on his arm kept the panic down.\nNow, tucked down the side of his box, there is a large piece of card, baring a single word. A single word that encapsulates that trip to the airport perfectly. 5 simple letters, the middle one more decorative than the others. Five simple letters, that signify to James that someone out there is rooting for him, that someone cares.\n", "19": "\nChapter Text\n\"I..I've found her sir.\"\"Her? James?\"\"The girl...the girl Zelinksy kidnapped. I found h-her\"\"That's brilliant. Good lad.\"\"It...it isn't sir.\"\"What?\"\"It isn't brilliant sir.\"\"James? James are you ok?\" There was no answer, just a click as Hathaway's phone had ended the call. Robbie would later learn that the call had ended because James' phone had slid out of his grasp and crashed onto the cold stone floor of the patio.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0Robbie arrived at the scene and parked his car in some available space a few streets. The area outside the house was swarming with grim faced SOCO's and uniformed constables. He couldn't see James anyway, and God knows he stood head and shoulders above the rest of his colleagues.\u00a0He hurriedly asks passing officers if they've seen Hathaway, but no one gives him an answer. He's told that Dr Hobson is waiting for him upstairs, and he goes to her, trusting James to be doing something worthwhile.\"Laura?\"\"Its not pretty Robbie, its really not.\" He stares at the girls body as Laura outlines her injuries. She's been here for a few days, and the smell advertises this to all in the room. He almost feels that he can't tear his gaze away, but he does, looking up to see Laura's slightly watery eyes looking into his own. This is going to be a tough case for all concerned.\"Where's Hathaway? He's normally here before you.\"\"He was\" Robbie says quietly, as the implications of the phone call he received from James earlier sink in. \"Oh God Laura...he found her.\"\"Go and find him Robbie, I'll give you the report later. Go and find James.\" Just then, a young constable knocks uncertainly on the door.\"Sir? Sergeant Hathaway is in the garden, says he's found some evidence.\" Robbie nods and dismisses the youngster, before taking a deep breath and heading towards his sergeant.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0James is stood by a small hole in the ground, staring at it like its the most interesting thing in the world. He snaps his head up as Robbie walks towards him, and starts speaking before Robbie has a chance.\"There's tool marks over there and there,\" he says calmly, pointing at marks in the grass that suggest a rake or shovel has been stood up in the soft ground recently. \"Been no rain so...so its all well preserved.\"\"James...\" Lewis starts, but Hathaway presses on.\"I've got forensics looking through the garage for a shovel or something. They can get fingerprints. It'll have traces of blood on it as well. I think it was in the attic before...just before. And then he carried it down...downstairs after he'd used it to...\" James coughs and looks away. His face hardens and he carries on with his report in a monotonous tone, as if he was reading a weather report.\"There's the starts of a grave here, doesn't look like he'd made much progress before we arrested him. At that garden centre. That could be why he hadn't finished. There's um, there's no over looking properties, so its unlikely anyone saw anything. And no one will have heard anything sir would they?\" Robbie can see that James is starting to lose his cool a bit and his heart aches for the young man in front of him.\"James...\" He tries again, and again, Hathaway keeps talking.\"No one will have heard anything will they sir? Because he'd have been quiet about it and she...and the girl...she couldn't have made any noise sir, because she was dead.\" He stops then, nothing more to say it seems. To anyone else, James would look the embodiment of calm and collected right now. But Lewis isn't just anyone else, he's worked with James for 5 years now and he knows what to look for. The way that James keeps swallowing, as if he's containing the words that he wants to say. The way his jaw is working, chewing the inside of his cheek to give him something else to focus on. At any other crime scene, James would have his moment of contemplation, and then he'd be off, carrying out his duties like his usual professional self. But he's not here. He's simply stood there,like he can't remember what he should be doing, staring at the beginnings of a shallow grave like he wants nothing more than for it to swallow him up. But Hathaway won't fall apart here, not with his colleagues so close by. Lewis knows what will happen; James will hold it in all day, making out that he's fine. And then the young man will take himself off home tonight, have a few strong drinks and then stamp his emotions down until they are buried.\u00a0But that won't do. Because Lewis knows that this won't go away. He's seen the body, and he knows that James was here alone when he found her, when he saw that. He'd bet money that James just stood there looking, unable to look away.\u00a0Robbie puts a hand on his shoulder gently.\"Come on lad. Lets get you out of here eh, somewhere warm.\"\"I'm...\"\"James...humour me eh?\" Hathaway nods reluctantly and follows him as they walk the few streets to Robbie's car.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0Robbie only turned his back for a few seconds. It was only the amount of time it took for him to bend into his car and chuck the papers onto the back seat so James could sit shotgun. But it was enough for James to seemingly disappear from sight. He was just about to head back to the crime scene, in case James had gone back for something, when he heard a soft sound from the passenger side of the car.Crossing around the front, he saw his young sergeant, sat in the road with his back against the car door, hands pressed into his eyes and elbows resting on drawn up knees. It seemed that once they were away from prying eyes, James had crumpled. The sitting on the road was probably a futile attempt to hide his weakness from Robbie as well. Well Lewis wasn't having it, Hathaway needed him now.\"James kidda. Are you alright?\" Hathaway shook his head, staying in the awkward position he was sat in.\"No. Sir how could-?...How do I even-?\" Robbie sighed sadly and crouched down to the younger man. He knew the questions, he asked them himself often enough. Sir how could someone do that? How do I even begin to deal with it? Robbie would have asked Morse over and over again, on multiple cases if he'd thought his inspector would have been able to give him an answer.\"Some people James, they just...do things. They aren't thinking, or they believe they are right.\"\"But..she was only six fucking years old.\" James takes a deep shuddering breath and continues. \"She..she had a teddy bear with her...in...in the cistern, all grubby and, it...she was still clutching it and-\" He stopped short and Robbie saw the horror in Hathaway's eyes as he watched his sergeant replaying the moment he found her in his head. Lewis doesn't have the answers to this one, doesn't know what to say, James is a tricky bugger to fathom at the best of times it has to be said. So Robbie just puts a comforting arm on his shoulder and gives it a squeeze, before pulling gently at the younger man's arm.\"Come on kidda, lets get you out of the road. Not a safe place to be sitting mate.\" James lets himself be guided to the kerb and sits down there, Robbie at his side, shoulders touching in an attempt at support.Before long, James starts taking deep breaths, trying to control himself as he stares ahead of him unseeing anything in the real world, instead seeing a child's body, packed into a water cistern. Lewis realises that James is crying before James himself does. Every exhale shakes and the air catches in the younger man's throat. Lewis lays a hand on James' back and gently rubs circles on it, trying to provide some comfort.\"Let it all out Jim lad. There's no one here. Its ok, you'll be alright, just let it out mate\"\u00a0With a strangled half sob, James does.\u00a0*******************************************\u00a0Once James tears have dried out, Lewis drives them both silently back to the station, where he instructs James to wait in the car while he goes to talk to Innocent. It worries him slightly that James doesn't protest. Doesn't really do anything.Jean is very understanding when he explains that he wants to take James home, and Robbie suspects that Laura called her in an attempt to warn her about James' possible state of mind. In any case, Robbie is grateful, because Jean fully agrees with his plan.\u00a0He takes drives them both to his own flat and gets James sitting on his sofa, a blanket around his shoulders. It hits him how bloody young the boy looks, shrinking under the cloth as if it'll protect him from the world.He disappears into the kitchen once he's sure James is going to stay sat on the sofa, and makes them both a cup of tea. Puts three sugars in James', two more than normal, but he knows it'll do the boy good. He knows what else might help, but he's undecided for the moment whether it'll be of any use.One look at Hathaway's shaking hands as he reaches for the tea and the quietly whispered 'thank you' that he gets, decides for him. He goes back into the kitchen and returns with a small shot glass of scotch.\"Sir?\" James says quietly.\"Just the one James. You got that?\"\"Yes sir.\" They sit in silence for a bout an hour, before James falls asleep on the sofa where he is sat, fingers buried in the blanket, all his limbs drawn in as close as they can be. Robbie eases a cushion under his head, and tucks the blanket around him as best he can, before going to his own room.\u00a0Lewis is there for him when he wakes screaming, in the middle of the night, bringing James back to himself and plying him with more sweet tea until the man goes back to sleep. He listens as James stutters out the events of the morning, encouraging the younger man to tell him what happened. He knows that James will feel better for telling someone else.\u00a0He wakes up in the morning to James sitting on the sofa, scrolling through his phone with only a slight tremor in his hands.\"Checking it works sir. I er...I dropped it after I phoned you yesterday, can hardly remember doing it\" The kettle pings to let them know that it has finished boiling. James gives him a ghost of a smile.\"I though it was about time I made you some tea sir.\" He mumbles as he goes to the kitchen.\u00a0Robbie knows that he's on the mend. He'll dream about this for a long time, the images flashing through his head when he least expects them, just as Mary Lapsley had haunted Morse.\u00a0And if he crumbles again...well Lewis will drive him home, give him tea and scotch and listen to anything the younger man wants to say.\u00a0And perhaps one day, James' memory of the horror, will be softened by the knowledge that the man who did it is staring at the same brick wall day after day.\n", "20": "\nChapter Text\nThere was a loud noise in the corridor, and Jean stuck her head out of her office to see what all the commotion was about. She didn't have to look far.Robbie and James had come back to the station, triumphant grins on their faces, and the suspect firmly held between them. The man was screaming profanities at the two of them, but it didn't seem to dampen their spirits.\"Bastard posh copper!\" The man spat, \"I should have thrown you from the fucking roof.\"\"Yeah well,\" James countered easily. \"Now I'm going to throw you in a cell, so we're all square aren't we?\" James walked away with the culprit, as Robbie stayed to brief Innocent on what went on.\"Well done Lewis, good arrest.\" Robbie shrugged, looking down the corridor after his sergeant's disappearing back.\"I didn't really do much. It was James that caught him. You should have seen it Jean, Jim flew after him like nothing else.\" It didn't surprise her, James had been determined to catch him after he'd assaulted an elderly lady.\"Well as long as there wasn't too much violence. I can't have an allegation of police brutality, no matter how much we wanted Turner in custody.\" Lewis smiled at her.\"I'm sure James behaved impeccably ma'am.\" She rolled her eyes at the inspector, Lewis and Hathaway could be as cheeky as ever when they wanted to be. She'd seen Turner when they brought him in, there was no obvious bruising. Still, it wouldn't hurt to remind the man who was boss.\"You just keep him on the straight and narrow Lewis, the last thing we want is your northern-ness influencing that nice young man\" She grinned at Robbie's mildly offended expression and walked back to her office, the mutterings of \"James? Nice?\" following behind her.\u00a0*******************************************************\u00a0Unfortunately, Michael Turner had accused Hathaway of 'police fucking brutality', and she had no choice but to call her the quiet young sergeant into her office.\"Ma'am,\" James said as he knocked lightly on the door. \"You wanted to see me?\"\"Yes. Is Robbie with you?\"\"Julie said nothing about him coming, shall I get him?\"\"No sergeant. I have a feeling this meeting will only be a short one, and I doubt Robbie will be helpful.\"\"Ma'am\" James replied warily, unsure what was expected of him. Innocent took a breath and gestured for him to sit down.\"Turner has made accusations of police brutality against you Hathaway.\" James immediately sat forward, anger on his face. She held up a hand to stop him. \"Now I don't believe them at all, but I have to investigate.\" She truly didn't believe Turner. Ignoring the fact that he was a lying scumbag, Hathaway's reaction had convinced her. He wasn't the kind of man that would try to lie his way out of it. No, James would own up, and then try to justify his actions. He had, many a time. It seemed like the right psychology. He was a complicated, and unpredictable young man, but he wasn't a dishonest one.\"Ma'am. I can assure you, that I used exactly as much force as necessary, maybe too little in fact. But I did not do anything that violates the PACE act. Of course, if you need to suspend me-\" At that moment, Jean's secretary walked in the a tray of tea that Jean had asked for ten minutes previously. Se smiled to herself as she realised that there was a mug there for James too; She had a sneaking suspicion that her secretary had the hots for the young, blond sergeant.Her thoughts were cut off as the secretary tripped and nearly spilt the drinks all over her desk. It would have happened, but for James throwing his weight against the chair and grabbing the tray as he moved backwards.\"Oh I'm..s-sorry. Thank you.\"\"No problem,\" James said graciously as the secretary took the tray from him and set it down properly. Jean would have found her stuttering sweet, but something that she had heard just then had worried her. She waited until the secretary had left before speaking.\"James, are you sure there was no violence?\" He cocked his head at her, looking slightly hurt and confused.\"No ma'am. I acted well within regulations, nothing untoward-\" Jean sighed mentally. The man was like a closed book. It'd take a crowbar to prise him open enough to get some feelings out of him sometimes. Luckily, she was known for her ability to coax answers from people.\"James, Melanie might have been too dazzled by you to hear it, but I wasn't.\" Hathaway now looked decidedly uncomfortable, and Jean knew she was onto something.\"I d-don't know what you mean ma'am.\"\"I heard you hiss when you hit that chair. Did Turner hit your back?\"\"No Ma'am.\"\"...Sergeant.\"\"Ma'am, I can categorically state that Turner did not hit me anywhere apart from my left arm and a swing at my face, that fortunately missed.\" She didn't accept that for a minute. Innocent had seen the look of pain that had crossed his features as he'd moved, and she'd heard the hiss that he'd thought the noise of the crockery had covered up.\"So why do you have pain on your back. Do NOT deny it sergeant.\" Her tone of voice brooked no argument and he shrugged.\"It just hurts, its nothing, all part of an arrest.\" Jean inwardly counted to ten. Hathaway could infuriate and worry her in equal measure too easily.\"Show me Hathaway.\"\"Ma'am I-\"\"As your superior officer, I have a duty of care to you James. And since you clearly haven't told Robbie, you're going to have to tell me.\" He hangs his head and then stands up slowly. Hathaway unbuttons the bottom of his shirt, and barely suppresses a shudder as the fabric moves against the injury. Jean gasps.\"I thought you said he didn't hit you!\"\"He didn't, not technically. If we're being precise, I, hit the side of the Bodlean.\"\"Have you seen this? You've taken the skin off the lower left of your back. Christ, there are chips from the wall in here James.\" He shrugs for the second time.\"We got Turner, this isn't important.\"\"Sergeant Hathaway! That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Stay where you are\" She leaves the office for a few minutes, and James desperately hopes that she isn't going to go and get Lewis. One lecture is bad enough, and he knows Lewis will go ape-shit if he realises that James hid the fact he got hurt, even if its only minor.When Jean returns, she is carrying a small green box.\"Shirt back up James.\" He realises its a first aid box and ignores her request.\"I'll be-\"\"-Hathaway, I don't believe you. You never even told Robbie you were hurt. And that needs to be cleaned up.\" James finds that he's lost the fight, and reluctantly pulls his shirt up again. He quietly allows Jean to wash the wound out, and to put antiseptic cream on it (which stings like hell and reminds him of many scraped knees in his childhood). He accepts it all without fuss though. Because, under the annoyance that no one can see how minor this is, and the embarrassment of having his boss see a weakness, he feels a strange sort of comfort at being taken care of.Once she was done, and he had a wound gauze on his back (he's not going to admit that his eyes widened when Jean took the biggest size out of the pack,) he stood up, testing the stretch of his skin.\"Thank you Jean.\" Her frown softened a little.\"James, I shouldn't have to insist that you get medical help if you get injured. And you shouldn't feel like you can't tell anyone. What if it had been something more serious? Like a head injury. You could have passed out at home later and none of us would even know that we needed to worry.\"\"I don't want you to worry.\"\"What do you think it would do to Laura and I if you got seriously ill from something like that and we didn't help? What do you think it'd do to Robbie if he had no idea you were hurting and then he finds you the next day, with no knowledge of what happened?\" James hangs his head again, its beginning to be a habit.\"I'm sorry, I just didn't think...\"\"I know. But do next time James please.\" She rested an arm on his shoulder and squeezed it gently. \"I won't tell Robbie James, not if you don't want me to. But please, and I'm saying this as a friend now, not your boss, please tell us if you get hurt on the job again.\" He nods contritely.\"I will. I'm sorry.\" She nods now, satisfied that he means it.\"As for Turner, I don't believe a word of what he says, he's lucky I don't add assaulting a police officer to his charges....He did push you into the building didn't he?\"\"Yes Ma'am.\" James replies quietly, clearly expecting another bollocking for not telling her that either.\"Well, he doesn't have a leg to stand on then does he? Go on James, back to the office. And tuck your shirt back in.\"\"Of course ma'am, an officer of the law must always look presentable.\" he says with a smirk and she's ninety percent sure that he just quoted the actual regulations at her.\"Get out sergeant.\" He goes, and she shakes her head fondly.While James may be one of the cleverest and most resourceful officers in her station, sometimes, she thinks he's also one of the stupidest.\u00a0\n", "21": "\nChapter Text\nJames Hathaway had had a crap couple of weeks. If pushed, he'd probably have gone as far as to say it was an absolutely fucking shite couple of weeks.\u00a0It had all started a fortnight ago, when there had been a murder in broad daylight on the high street. He and Lewis had been top of the rotation, and it had been their job to go and interview the people at the scene. It wasn't the violence that had got to him, although it had been a brutal attack. He's been a police officer for long enough now to have become somewhat hardened to violence and its effects.What got to him was the witnesses that he had to interview. Some of them were in shock, which was perfectly understandable, given what they'd seen. One old lady had been shaking as they stood there, and before he'd realised what he was doing, he'd guided her into a chair and sent a uniformed officer to procure a milky, sugary cup of tea for her.\"I-I'm not sure what I saw sergeant.\"\"James. Its ok. Just tell me whatever you can remember.\"\"He was...he was wearing a red shirt I think. Y-yes, a read polo shirt and black jeans. He ran past me and-\" She started to cry and James laid a hand on hers, trying to comfort her as best he could.\"That's been very helpful Mrs Kerr. Thank you. I'll ask this officer to get you home now. Is there anyone who can stay with you?\"\"Yes, my daughter is at home.\"\"Ok, If you remember anything else, please let us know. And if you want to talk to someone, you can phone this number.\" he said as he handed her a card with the liason officer's number on it.\"Thank you sergeant, you've been very kind.\" He smiled at her as the uniformed officer lead her towards a car. Lewis came up behind him, and what he was feeling, must have shown on his face as his inspector bumped his elbow.\"She'll be alright you know. They all will James. You did a great job with her.\" Hathaway nodded but didn't answer. While he had been somewhat affected by the old lady, and the other witnesses that were dealing with various stages of shock; that wasn't what had got to him.\u00a0What had got to him, was the fact that he'd seen those same fearful, grief stricken eyes before. In his bathroom mirror. He shook himself as the memory of a cold and dusty attic surfaced, and clenched a fist as his mind taunted him, projecting images of his own hand opening the cistern. Just when he feared he wasn't strong enough to push the memories away this time, a hand gripped his elbow.\"Don't know about you Jim, but I could do with a cuppa.\" The smile came to his lips unbidden, as much from relief than the fact that he hadn't realised exactly how badly he wanted a cup of tea as well.\u00a0******************************************\u00a0The week after hadn't been any better. He and Lewis had been detailed to work on a sexual assault case, and the whole thing had him despairing at humanity. He'd tried and failed to understand how someone could do that to another human being. After a few hours of questioning their suspects, James was at the end of his tether. Lewis recognised this and all but dragged him out of the room, instructing him to try and calm down.\u00a0He'd never been so glad to see the back of a case. The night they finished that one, he'd had takeaway and copious amounts of beer at Lewis'.The hangover he had in the morning did nothing to improve his mood.\u00a0******************************************\u00a0So it was no surprise that when he was given the task of looking after a child, whose only parent had just been arrested for violence, that James felt he wasn't up to the task.\"Sir...please, get someone else.\"\"There isn't anyone lad. Look, I know you were looking forward to band practice, but its only until her aunt shows comes down from Reading.\"\"-Its not that.\"\"What then? James?\"\"These last two weeks have been a pile of crap sir. I'm done with it. I can't think about it any more. I just want to go home, drink a bottle of wine, and crawl under my bed covers.\" He paused, trying to work out what he was trying to say. \"Sir...the state of mind I'm in, I am the last person that should be left with a child. Let alone one that just saw her father get arrested.\"\"I'm sorry kidda. Its either this or interview the father. Its down to us mate.\" He could see from Robbie's eyes that the older man was truly sorry that he had to be asked. And James knew that he just didn't have it in him to interview anyone. He sighed, running hand through his hair.\"Where's the kid sir?\"\u00a0******************************************\u00a0The little girl in question didn't seem to be too phased by what was going on. Beyond finding out that her name was Ruby, and she was six years old, James hadn't really talked to her. A WPC had given Ruby some paper and colouring pencils and the child had happily started drawing a unicorn. From what James could see of it, the drawing was fairly good.He was amusing himself (if one could use that word) by reading one of the kids novels left on the table in the room. So far, he'd spotted two spelling mistakes, one grammatical error and an example of poor printing in one chapter. But he wasn't really paying attention, his mind was running through everything he'd seen in the last fortnight, and he was being highly unsuccessful at pushing it all away. It wouldn't do to have the kid pick up on his feelings. He was supposed to be a calming influence, not that young Ruby looked like she needed it. Then again, James remembers all to well how easy it had been for him to look like a happy six year old, when in truth, he was far from it.\u00a0\"...book?\" He jerked his head up as he registered Ruby's voice.\"Sorry, what did you say?\" The kid sighed slightly, coming closer to him.\"I said, are you reading a sad book?\" James did a double take, he could barely remember what the last page was even about, it was a distraction, he wasn't paying attention to the plot.\"No, its not sad. Its quite a happy book.\" I think. \"Why do you ask? Would you like to read it?\"\"No thank you Mister policeman.\" She fiddled with the hem of her skirt, before looking up at him earnestly. \"If the book is a happy one, why are you sad?\"\"W-What?\" James blinked, he got the distinct feeling, that he was being psychoanalysed by a six year old.\"Why are you so sad? You look sad.\" She put her small hand on the seat next to him and hauled herself beside him. \"You're a nice policeman. I don't want you to be sad.\" James smiled at her as best he could manage.\"I'm not sad Ruby. I'm fine. I've just had a tough couple of weeks.\"\"You're lying mister. You aren't fine.\" She wanders back over to her small rucksack and pulls something from it, before walking back over to him.\"Here. This is Mr Bear. I think you should have him, he's good at making people feel better.\" James looks down at the small blue bear that has been pressed into his hand. The fur is soft and he can't help but run his thumb down the bears belly. Even as he looked down at it, he knew he couldn't accept this bear though. He might be many things, but he was not going to take a little girl's bear, just for his own selfish need.\"That's very sweet of you Ruby, but I'm sure Mr Bear will be happier with you.\"\"No, he wants to go with you mister-...what's your name?\"\"Serg- James. My name is James.\"\"James,\" The little girl repeated, before fixing him with what she clearly thought was an assertive stare. \"Mr Bear likes you and he wants to stay with you.\"\"Ok, we'll see when your aunt gets here shall we,\" James said, even though he had no intention of keeping the little girl's toy.\u00a0Sure enough, when Ruby's aunt came to collect her, Mr Bear had 'magically' found hi way back into Ruby's rucksack.\u00a0******************************************\u00a0Four days later, Lewis came into the office with a small parcel addressed to Hathaway.\"This was waiting for you at front desk. You didn't mention expecting anything.\"\"I'm not expecting anything...I don't know what that could be.\"\"Well, its yours, whatever it is,\" Lewis said, as he handed the parcel to James and sat down at his own desk. James put it to one side, a break in their latest case diverting his curiosity for the time being.\u00a0If Robbie was surprised by the smile that lit James' face an hour later as he opened the parcel, and read the note that accompanied it, he didn't say anything.\u00a0One day, he'd get Hathaway to tell him what was so special about the little blue bear that now lived on the shelf by his desk. But for now, he was content for the little toy just to make James happy as it watched him work. \u00a0\n", "22": "\nChapter Text\n\nMorse groaned. Damn these big bloody country estates. And damn armed robbers that go to ground in them. \n\u00a0\nA gang of armed robbers had run into the grounds and hidden. They'd shot a young girl cashier and one of the coppers that was sent in to apprehend them. As it was, they were sat in the estate managers house. The estate manager was no-where to be seen, but his wife, who had just made tea for the cops invading her living room, informed him that her husband was up at the Mortmaigne's house. Morse got the distinct feeling that he was there often.\n\n\"You're on your own in the house then Mrs...?\"\n\n\"Josephine please inspector.\"\n\n\"You're on your own in the house then Josephine?\"\n\n\"No, my son is out the back playing. He's four.\"\n\n\"Ah. I would advise that you bring him inside. The men we are hunting are not the most principled.\" Morse felt uneasy about the idea of a young boy outside alone with a gang of armed men running around. No, it'd definitely be safer for the child to be in the house, with his mother. She evidently agreed because she immediately got up and headed towards the back door. He sat, observing the furnishings of the house, a strange sense of unease prickling at the back of his neck. Typically, when the police turned up at a house, the kids were the first in the room, asking annoying questions and being awestruck by the presence of coppers in the house. Yet the boy had stayed away, and he surely couldn't have missed the sirens and flashing lights.\n\u00a0\nHis fears were confirmed when the lady of the house came rushing back in, wringing her hands frantically.\n\n\"He's gone inspector, no trace of him!\" He bade her calm down and then signalled to the uniformed copper stood anxiously by the door.\n\n\"Do a quick sweep of the area constable, he's only four, he couldn't have gone far.\" Josephine looks up to give him a sad smile.\n\n\"You don't have kids do you Mr Morse, believe me, they can cover larger distances than you'd think.\"\n\n\"No, no I don't\" Morse said sadly. \"What does your son look like?\"\n\n\"H-he's so high\" she stutters, indicating about 3 foot with her hand. \"He has short blond hair and blue eyes.\"\n\n\"His name? He might respond if the uniformed men can call his name as they are looking.\"\n\n\"J-James.\"\n\n\"Got that Constable?\" Morse asks the uniformed man. He nods grimly and motions for a few more men to follow him. Morse didn't miss that grin look. That copper had been at the bank and he's seen these men in action. It's clear that he doesn't hold out much hope for the four year old's chances. Morse grimaces, where did this bloody idiot train? Number one rule when kids go missing: you don't show lack of hope in front of the parents. He glares at the retreating man's back. Amateur!\n\u00a0\nHe's just about to attempt to calm the distressed mother down, when a uniformed copper bursts into the room. \n\n\"Sir!\" he says breathlessly, his Geordie accent thick with nerves and stress. \"Our boys have picked them up, less than half a mile away.\" The lad looks slightly terrified, Morse wouldn't mind betting that it's his first big job like this.\n\n\"Tell them to wait for me before making a move. Do they know about the missing boy?\" The copper shakes his head.\n\n\"What boy sir?\"\n\n\"He went missing from here. Four years old. Let the lads know. And then I need you to come back here and sit with the mother.\" The copper nodded and jogged out.\n\nTwo minutes later, he's back and he stands awkwardly in the doorway.\n\n\"Er...shall ah make a brew sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" These kids, no one teaches them to make decisions these days. He softens his glare though. This one is trying, and he hasn't done a bad job so far.\n\n\"Ok Josephine, I'm going to leave you in the capable hands of constable....er?\"\n\n\"Lewis sir. PC Robbie Lewis.\"\n\n\"Good lad. Just look after her ok?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\u00a0\nFifteen minutes later and Morse is crouching in a bush, surrounded by uniformed policemen. Its a stand-off, the gang hiding in a similar place about 100 metres away. The chief inspector is getting frustrated. Its a stale mate and he hates them. Every minute that they were there, he and his men were in danger.\n\nSuddenly, he hears a crunch followed by a surprised gasp. Its only when the first gasp is followed by several more that it clicks in his head. The boy! Its not gasping, its crying. Morse looks over the top of the foliage, and sees the child wandering through the wood, clutching a blanket and sobbing quietly. At the same precise moment, he sees the gang leader look and notice the child too. It hits him that the man is planning to snatch the kid, and he urgently whispers to the two constables closet to him.\n\n\"Covering fire, on my signal. And watch that kid, I don't want the shot going anywhere near him.\" They nod, and aims their sights over the boys head.\n\n\"James?\" the little boy looks around in shock, eyes wide.\n\n\"What are you doing out here lad? Come on, come towards me, there's a good boy.\" Little James merely stares, frozen to the spot in fear.\n\n\"I'm a policeman James\", Morse says kindly but urgently, as he notices the gang leader making a move towards the child. It's obvious that the boy isn't going to move, he's clearly terrified. There's nothing for it. \n\n\"NOW!\" he shouts, running towards James, bullets flying overhead. He dives to the ground, pulling the four year old down with him. \n\u00a0\n10 minutes later, and all the excitement has died down. Morse walks back towards the Hathaway's little cottage, James ensconced in his arms. The little boy is still crying and Morse doesn't know how to comfort him. He tries gently shushing him, tries simply asking him to stop crying. He could palm the kid off on one of the many policemen that are wandering around, but a tiny part of Morse is enchanted by the trusting little life that he's holding. For while he's crying, James has grabbed hold of Morse's shirt and he won't let go. The gruff old chief inspector is strangely moved by it.\n\u00a0\nHe returns to the house and is surprised to find young Lewis sitting on his own.\n\n\"Where's Mrs Hathaway?\"\n\n\"The doc had t'come and sedate her sir. She heard the gunshots and went hysterical.\"\n\n\"Ok then. Well, we have her son here, when she returns to the here and now. I only wish I knew how to stop the little sod crying.\" The young constable smiles and Morse knows that Lewis sees right through his gruff dismissal of the child.\n\n\"I have two bairns sir, give him here.\" Morse walked over and Lewis firmly but gently forced the little boy to relinquish his grip on Morse's shirt. \n\u00a0\nMorse sat back and watched as the uniformed man coaxed James to stop crying. Soon enough, little James was curled into PC Robbie Lewis' side, sniffling slightly and fighting sleep. Lewis' helmet was sitting on his knee and the young boy sleepily traced the badge on the front with his finger.\n\u00a0\nOnce he had learned that Morse would stay until Mrs Hathaway had recovered, Lewis immediately volunteered as well. The chief inspector thought that the young man would go far, he'd be an asset to CID. He was obviously adaptable, going from chasing criminals, to looking after terrified mothers, to calming young children with ease. Although the child bit seemed to come naturally.\n\u00a0\nMorse looked up from the book he was reading and he couldn't help but smile. Both of them were asleep, Lewis' arm protectively cradling the child even while he slumbered. Mrs Hathaway emerged and gently removed little James from the tired young copper's arms, thanking Morse profusely for bringing her child back safe. She went to put James to bed, and Morse gently tapped Lewis' shoulder. He was acutely aware that all the other uniforms had left the scene and he wondered how this lad was going to get home to his own kids.\n\n\"Come on lad, wake up\" He watched almost fondly as the young Geordie stirred in confusion, snapping awake as he realised that the child was gone from his grasp. Morse stilled him, with a gentle hand on the shoulder.\n\n\"The child is safe in bed constable, come on, I'll give you a lift home.\"\n\u00a0*****************************************\u00a0Lewis has worked with James for 5 years before he recalls any of this. They are sitting in a pub that he'd often drank in with Morse. Although, thinking about it, he'd have to leave Oxford to find a pub that he hadn't drank in with Morse.\u00a0He wonders what Morse would have thought about James, what he'd have thought of the way the little scared four year old had grown up. He reckons that Hathaway and Morse would have bonded over hard childhoods, if nothing else. It certainly wasn't going to be religious beliefs, or love of Wagner. Would his former mentor be glad of James' chosen profession?He feels an ache that he hasn't felt for a while. He hasn't thought of Morse in a while, not properly. Hathaway walks back to his their table, carrying two beers. Before Robbie has chance to say thanks, James has turned around and disappeared again. It worries Robbie a little. It was only a couple of hours ago, that he'd had to talk James out of handing in his resignation.\u00a0When James appears again a few minutes later, holding on to two whisker chasers, Robbie smiles. He fancies he can hear Morse's voice in his head;\n\"You've got yourself a good boy there Lewis, you see that you look after him. Don't let him go the same way as me.\"\nRobbie promises the Morse in his head that he'll look after James, as the man in question sets the scotches on the table. He wonders if James remembers anything of that day back when he was a child. Considering what they've just learnt about Creavecour Hall, Robbie isn't sure that he should bring it up. After all, he's still unclear about how much Hathaway knew about what was going on.\u00a0As it turned out, he didn't have to bring it up at all. James did that himself, while sipping at his whiskey.\"That wasn't the first time that there has been that many police up at Creavecour you know sir?\"\"No?\" Lewis answers casually. He's aware that this might be James trying to tell him something important, and he doesn't want to make the lad clam up.\"My mother always used to tell me about the time that a gang of armed robbers used the grounds to er...go to ground, as it were and I wandered off. She said that a chief inspector found me and brought me back, while a young constable sat with her. \" Relief flooding him that James didn't just tell him something horrible about his youth, Robbie smirked into his glass. James is always surprising him with his wit and knowledge, its Robbie's turn for a change.\"That must have been scary for you.\"\"S'pose, don't really remember it. Apparently I fell asleep on the constable.\"\"Aye, that you did.\"\"Mum said that he fell asleep t-\" Lewis grinned. \"Wait, how do you know?\"\"1982 that was. PC Robbie Lewis, fresh into Oxford and scared shitless.\"\"You! I fell asleep on you?\" James was incredulous.\"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on your armchair. Morse had to wake me up, gave me a lift home as well.\" James squirmed a little in embarrassment. Lewis' grin grew wider. \"I promise James, you behaved impeccably.\" The younger man scowled at him.\"You might've mentioned it.\"\"I only just remembered.\" He paused, staring down into his drink. \"You know, its funny really.\"\"What's funny sir?\" James clearly thought Robbie was going to laugh at him, and he was quick to explain.\"That was the first time I met Morse. Properly talked with him like. The next was a few years later. I think we'd both forgotten that we'd met at Creavecour by then. But that second time, he took me on as his sergeant. And now here we are. Me, the inspector for the little boy that caused our first meeting.\" James watches him, clearly unsure what to say.\"I...er...\"\"He'd have liked you James. I really think he'd have liked you.\" James smiled warmly at him and settled back in his chair, looking out at the river.Lewis followed suit, contemplating how strange it should be, that his past and his present should come crashing together in such a fashion. Sneaking a glance at the man he was beginning to see as a son, he thanked whatever was answerable that it had.\n", "23": "\nChapter Text\nLewis was at his wits end. James had driven to Bristol to meet a man he'd been in university with, who said he had information. They were investigating the murder of two young women and the disappearance of a student from Oxford. James had informed Lewis that he was going to drive there via the sites that the bodies were found, to try and work out a possible route the killer sould have taken. Robbie had been a bit apprehensive about James going alone, but the younger man had shrugged him off with 'Harry was a mate, he's not going to do anything. If anyone should be scared, its him, especially if he's going to give me the name of the murderer and his associates.'. Robbie hadn't been happy about it at all, but nonetheless, James had left at half one that afternoon. It was now half ten at night. According to google maps (as he been shown by Hathaway) it should have taken James a little over two hours to get there, and another two to get back. Add another hour and a half for parking and meeting his friend, and checking out the dump sites, and that would have taken him to seven pm. Even adding an hour for traffic, and James should have been back two hours ago. Even if he was being waylaid, James would have let him know. He'd never knowingly make him worry.Robbie had tried James' phone every half an hour, since the time he should have been back. Each of the four times, it had rung onto voicemail. At first, he'd just assumed that James was driving, but he knew that the younger man wouldn't ignore four missed calls. He'd pull over and return them as soon as he could. Ordinarily, Robbie wouldn't have been too worried yet, but he didn't really know who James was going to meet, and he knew how out of the way the body locations were.Even so, there was nothing he could do for the moment, it had only been two hours. No matter how much she also cared for James, Innocent just couldn't spare the resources for a man that could just be in a pub, having lost track of time.Robbie would just have to wait, and try and do some paperwork.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Maud and Fred Richardson were driving back from their son's house, after visiting him and their grandson. They had intended to leave earlier, but they'd lost track of time. And so it was that they were driving home in the dark at ten pm. They were trying to avoid the traffic, so they were using the back roads.\"Its going to be a cold one tonight Maud, did you put the heating on a timer?\"\"Yes, it should have come on half an hour ago dear. It'll be nice and warm once we get home\"\"40 years of marriage and you've never forgotten the heating yet.\"\"Oh shut up you old softie,\" Maud smiled as her husband drove them homeward. It started to snow and they were both grateful for the heating, both in their car, and waiting for them at home.\"I think a cup of tea is-\" Maud broke off as she saw a car seemingly abandoned by the side of the road. Normally, she would have dismissed it as some kids playing, but something about this pricked her instincts. \"Fred, love I think we should check that out.\" Fred slowed down a little as he got closer, but he was reluctant to stop.\"We've still got an hour and a half Maud dear, its probably just a stolen car some kids have abandoned.\"Maud was about to agree with her husband, until she saw a dark lump lying a few feet away from the front of the car as they drove past.\"Oh Fred, I'm sure there was a man lying near it. Turn around.\"\"It was probably just shadows dear.\"\"Maybe, but what if it wasn't? Its snowing Fred, whoever it is will freeze.\" Despite his eagerness to get home, Fred Richardson was a kind man, and he wouldn't have forgiven himself if he'd driven away. As soon as it was safe, he turned his car around, and headed back towards the abandoned (or so he hoped) vehicle.\u00a0To their dismay, the lump by the side of the road was indeed a person. Calling for Maud to pick up the torch from the glove compartment, Fred hurried over to the prone form as fast at the ice and snow would allow. He bent down to the figure and turned him slightly, dislodging snowflakes from the short hair.\"What are you doing out here eh son? No place to be taking a nap\" he joked, hoping in vain for a response. There was none forthcoming. He felt for a pulse as his wife shined the torch on them both.\"Is he...\" Fred paused, willing there to be a pulse under his fingers. Thankfully, he felt one, although he was under no illusions that the young man was in a bad way.\"No\" He breathed out in relief. \"No he's alive Maud. I don't know how though.\" Now that the young man was illuminated in torch light, they could see the state he was in. His face was bruised and there were a few cuts peppered across his cheek. His lip was split, and he had the beginnings of a black eye. What was worrying the old man most though, was the hue of his skin. The young man was pale, almost blending in with the snow that had fallen around him. He was cold to touch, and when Fred pulled a hand away from his head, he was shocked to see some blood on his fingers. By the torchlight, he could see short blond hair that appeared to be matted with blood.\"Stay with him Maud, I'm going to see if we still have that blanket in the car.\"\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Robbie tried James' mobile again, but either it was switched off, or it had no signal, because it wasn't even ringing any more.\"Where are you kidda?\" He glanced at his watch; eleven o'clock. Right. Sod it. He got up and walked purposefully to Innocent's office.\u00a0Knocking on the door, he was relieved to find that there was no one already in there. Jean looked up straight away and she must have seen the worry on his face, because she gestured for him to sit down immediately.\"Robbie, what is it?\"\"James ma'am. He was supposed to be back at seven.\"\"Traffic?\"\"For three hours? Nah. You know him Jean, he'd have called the station to let them know. Or he'd have called me.\"\"And you're worried.\"\"Its not like him.\" Robbie ducked his head. \"I've tried to call him five times now. The first four rang out, and now its not even ringing. Jean, something must have happened to him.\" Innocent sighed. \"Technically, I can't do anything yet-\" She held up a hand to stop the angry outburst that she knew would be coming. \"-But, you are right, its very out of character for him. Go and find some officers that aren't doing anything and tell them James' route. Have them go and look for him Robbie.\"\"Thank you ma'am.\" Robbie bit back what he wanted to say; If he's near Bristol, he's two hours away ma'am, we may not have that much time. He didn't say it though. He knew Jean was doing everything that she could, he see how worried she was. It would be unfair to have a go at her.He got up and after giving her a nod, he walked out to find some idle coppers.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Fred brought the picnic blanket back to his wife and the stricken young man. It wasn't much, but it would provide an extra layer, and he figured this kid could do with it. Kneeling down beside his wife, he tucked the blanket around the man.\"There you go lad, might keep you a bit warmer don't you think?\" Still no response.\"What do we do Fred?\" His wife asked. \"There's no signal here, and we can't leave him to get help.\"\"I'm not sure. We definitely can't leave the poor young sod here, he'll freeze to death or someone will run him over.\"\"We've got to do something dear. Look at him, there's nothing to him as it is.\"\"Maybe we should wait a few more minutes, just to see if he comes round, and then we'll drive him into the nearest hospital.\"\"Five minutes then. He needs to be in hospital Fred. They need to be getting him warm, never mind anything else.\" Fred patted this young man's leg and elicited a sharp gasp from him. Looking down, he saw blood on the trousers. \"Christ Maud, his leg is broken. Dammit, I should have checked. Go and get some thick sticks please. I'll try and splint it.\" He looks down at the man, who seems to be climbing into consciousness. \"I'm sorry lad, I should have checked. How long have you been awake and in pain eh?\" Maud heard this as she returned with a few thick sticks and rested a hand on her husband's shoulder.\"You're not in the army any more Fred, its ok to be out of practice.\" A pained groan splintered the moment and they both turned their attention to the young man lying next to them.\"Hello son. Its good to see you awake. I'm Fred, this is my wife Maud.\" The man starts trying to move and jars his leg, ripping a hoarse scream from his throat.\"No, don't do that. Can you tell me your name laddie?\"\"J-James...\" the man gasps out, and Fred smiles.\"Well James, it seems you've got yourself into a bit of bother. You've been hit on the head. Your right leg is broken, and you've been a bit beaten about. I'm going to put it in a makeshift splint. Ok?\" James nods and Maud squeezes his shoulder.\"He used to be in the army James love, he knows what he's doing.\" Another nod, and Fred talks to him again.\"Sorry kiddo, we don't have any painkillers, so this is going to hurt.\"\"B-been shot...felt p-pain...jus' do it.\"\"Army?\" James shakes his head slowly.\"P-police. Oxford...CID\"\"Good lad. Right here we go.\" Quietly, he turns to his wife. \"Give him your hand to squeeze Maud, and try to hold him down if he moves too much.\" The old lady shuffled so that she was by James' head, and then took his hand, before resting his head on her knee to support him.\"Don't you worry about my fingers love. You squeeze them as hard as you need to.\"\"Might r-regret....saying th-that\" James says with a small, pained chuckle.\"Nah, you ready?\"\"Y-yeah.\"As gentle as Fred tries to be, James is soon holding onto Maud's hand as though his life depended on it. As he starts to try and take deep breaths, he realises that his chest hurts. Fred notices and stops what he's doing.\"Does breathing hurt James?\"\"Mmmm...Deep b-breaths...a lot.\"\"I think you've got a few cracked ribs lad. Let me check after I'm done with this leg of yours. Try to keep calm.\"James grunts in pain as Fred jostles his leg a little, but he doesn't cry out again, instead he just clings to Maud's hand . He tries to use the pain in his chest as a distraction, but it doesn't work, he's not sure what hurts more, his leg of his ribs.It soon comes to his attention that his leg is immobilised. He also realises how cold he is, unconsciousness and adrenaline keeping it at bay until that moment. He shivers violently and whimpers as it aggravates the pain in his ribs.\"I know James, I know. It'll be ok love,\" Maud soothes, with little success. Fred carefully feels along James' ribs, until he identifies which ones are damaged.\"I don't think they're out of place, just cracked. They won't be stabbing through your lungs any time soon. But we need to get you to a hospital my boy.\" James shakes his head.\"N-not hospital...need to...phone my boss...H-he'll come and p-pick m-me up.\"\"James son, you've got a head injury, a broken leg, and cracked ribs.\"\"B-be fine...not that bad...need...get back t'work...reports t'write.\" Fred shakes his head, and then something occurs to him. The boy is probably bordering on hypothermia, assuming he's not suffering from it already. It would account for the confusion and disorientation he's showing. And the aforementioned head injury isn't going to be helping.\"Maud dear, could you try and warm him up? Hug him close, but watch his ribs. And keep him talking. I need to check his head wound, but I don't want to alarm the poor bloke. We need to try and keep him awake I think.\"\"Of course I can.\" She looks down at James. \"Well now love, why don't you tell me about yourself eh?\"\"D-don't wan'...hosp...hosp'tal.\"\"I know. But while we're sitting here, we may as well get to know each other.\" She wraps the blanket around him more, and circles her arm around his chest, making sure that Fred can get to his head, but its still resting on her knee. \"Tell you what James. Can you remember what happened to you? Why don't you tell me how you got into this mess?\" James blinks up at her a few times, and then haltingly explains what happened.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0\nHathaway got out of the car at the second dump site. Tasmin Gibson had been 17 when she was murdered, and her body had been left in the woods, not far from the roadside on a remote stretch between Oxford and Bristol. Her body had been discovered by a dog walker, three days after the previous victim's body had been found. The post mortem had shown that both girls had died three days previous, and forensics had come to the conclusion that they were probably killed in the same place. A young man was missing from Bristol, and it was looking increasingly likely that he wouldn't be found alive. James had taken it upon himself to retrace the route, on his way to Bristol, and try and identify any areas in which the young man's body was likely to be found. \n\u00a0\nWhile he stood there surveying the scene, and trying to work out if its possible that there was a second body in this area, that had just been missed; a dark coloured car pulled up behind his. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up a little, and he walked closer to his own car, making sure he had easy access to the driver seat. As he watched however, three men got out of the car and started to walk towards him. James was fairly alarmed now; if they'd needed to ask him something like directions, or even for help, it wouldn't take three of them to do it. \n\nHis fear was justified, as he heard one of the men whisper urgently 'Yeah, that's him' and he heard the unmistakeable thump of someone hefting a blunt instrument. Shit James, what have you stumbled into, he thought to himself as they came closer. He attempted to get in his car, uncaring if they knew he was scared. Before he managed it though, one of them was upon him, and dragged him free of the door, shoving him into the clear space of the lay-by.\n\n\"Sergeant Hathaway I presume,\" The largest looking one said. James could see from the faint moonlight that the man was completely bald, and just behind his left ear, was a tattoo of a wolf fang, which was the main feature of the gang they were investigating. If he was wondering how they knew his name, he didn't have to wait long.\n\n\"Harry sends his regards. He can't make it I'm afraid. See, the boss doesn't like snitches. He doesn't like coppers either. So imagine his delight when he discovers that dear Harry is going to be talking to a copper about him. He wasn't best pleased, was he Sid?\" James groaned mentally. They weren't trying to hide their identities, they obviously weren't worried about him being able to point them out at a later date.\n\n\"No John, not pleased at all.\"\n\n\"So he sent us to sort it all out for him. And that's just what we're going to do.\" James tried the first thing he could think of. \n\n\"My boss knows where I am, I'm expected back. Anything happens to me and they'll come and hunt you down so fast you won't know what's hit you.\"\n\n\"You don't really believe that do you sergeant? You're in the middle of nowhere and you're at least an hour and a half from your station. You'll have been here for nearly two hours before anyone even gets worried enough to come looking.\" Before James has a chance to answer, the one of them that hasn't spoken yet, darts forward and shoves him to the ground. A few seconds and they set upon him. Agility means that he dodges the first few blows, but one is landed on his rib and the air is knocked from him. There's a fist in his face, followed in quick succession by a few more, and he knows he's lost the fight. A ring scrapes across his scalp, and he can feel the tickle where blood is oozing slowly out. Knowing that there's no point trying to fight his way out, he gives up and awaits the next blow. Another hit to his ribs, and he closes his eyes; if he's going to die this way, he doesn't want to see it coming. Then as soon as the blows started, they stopped.\n\n\"I think he's copped it.\"\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"Yeah. And if he ain't, he won't last long out here will he? Come on, lets split. Its going to snow soon, we don't want to leave tracks for them to follow do we?\". James, somewhere on the edge of consciousness, doesn't really pick up on all of this. What he does pick up on, is the lead pipe that's slammed into his tibia. He hears the crunch and pain overwhelms him, dragging him over the edge into oblivion. \n\u00a0\"Fred. Fred he's out cold.\"\"Shit, he's getting worse. Right nothing for it Maud love, we'll have to drive him to hospital now, whether he likes it or not.\" He gently lifts James off Maud's lap, and lays him down on the ground. \"Pack that blanket around him tighter. That's it. Now we need to get him in the back seat. Carefully though, too much movement will mess up his heart rhythm.\"They get James into the back seat of their car without mishap. Maud almost wishes the young man was awake and moaning in pain. Almost. At least that way, she'd know he was alive. They decide that Maud will sit in the back with him, and that way, they can rest his bad leg on the front passenger seat. It'll be a squeeze, but with a splint on it, they don't have much choice. Besides, one look at Maud told Fred that she wouldn't be able to be calm if she didn't have an easy way of checking on the young man they had brought into their care. He made sure his wife and the young invalid were settled in the back, and then he drove off, as fast as was safe.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Lewis looked at the screen of his phone, as it vibrated angrily, alerting him to the fact that someone was ringing him. Laura. As much as he wanted to carry on organising the search party for James, he couldn't ignore her call.\"Laura.\" He sighed tiredly.\"Its true isn't it? I've been hearing some rumours about a CID sergeant gone missing. Its-\"\"-James. Yeah. Been out of touch for about three and a half hours now.\"\"That's not like him.\"\"That's what I said, Innocent as well. We've got officers on his last known route looking for him and-\" He looked up as a young constable shouted to him, waving excitedly. \"Laura I have to go, looks like something is happening.\"\"Ok, let me know what happens Robbie.\"\"I will, I'll keep you posted, promise. Bye Laura\" He shut off the call and turned to the young copper.\"What have you got lad?\"\"Traffic found Hathaway's car abandoned sir. Bout half an hour from Bristol.\"\"What have they said?\" The youngster swallowed nervously.\"Sergeant Hathaway isn't there sir. The keys are still in the ignition, but he engine wasn't running when they got there\"\"And James?\" Robbie asked, even though he had a feeling that he knew was coming.\"No sign of him sir. But there's um...some blood at the scene. And an discarded length of pipe a few metres up the road, along with a set of tyre tracks. Forensics are up there taking casts as we speak sir, and our boys are combing the woods to see if Sergeant Hathaway is maybe taking shelter in them.\"\"Good man\" Robbie said roughly. While it was good news that they hadn't found James' body, the idea of the man alone in the woods, and possibly injured, wasn't making him feel better about the situation.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Hathaway groaned in pain as they went over a speed bump.\"Hello dear, we were starting to get worried about you,\" Maud said to him as he tried to sit up. \"No, no, you need to stay lying down love.\" She circled his chest again protectively and he quickly relaxed as much as he could.\"Where w'going?\"\"Hospital James. We need to get you looked at.\"\"N-no.\"\"Enough of that young man. You need help.\" He coughed and it sent a spasm of pain through his ribs, which in turn set off a coughing fit. Each cough felt like he was being stabbed and there were soon tears in his eyes as he tried not to cry out.\"H-hurts\" He managed through pained gasps.\"That's why you need to go to hospital James.\" He nodded as more coughs wracked his body.\"W-want...pain...t'stop.\"\"I know. Shhh love, its ok. It'll all be ok.\" She absently runs her thumb over the back of the confused young man's hand, continuing to murmur comfort to him. \"He's still a bit out of it Fred, more like a child than a police officer, poor sod.\"\"Its ok. We're five minutes from the John Radcliff. We'll get him looked at in no time. \"\"He's only a couple of years younger than our Rick, I reckon.\"\"Maud dear, he'll be ok, they'll sort him out.\"\"I hope so. I think I may have developed a soft spot for this young man.\"\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Robbie had been updating Jean on the situation when his phone rang. Although Jean would ordinarily have given him an ear bashing if he'd dared answer it in her office instead of talking to her, she was aware these were special circumstances. She was also aware, that if the caller bared news of his sergeant, she'd have no power at all to stop Robbie taking the call.\"I know where he is Ma'am.\"\u00a0Ten minutes later, Jean gathered everyone involved in the search into the office. Once the hubbub had died down, she spoke.\"I have received information concerning Sergeant Hathaway. The John Radcliff just phoned Inspector Lewis to inform him that they have James on their high dependency unit. From what I could gather, he's suffering from moderate hypothermia, as well as fractures to his leg and ribs after what looks to be an assault. They assured Lewis that he should make a full recovery in time.\" There was a ripple of relief around the room. The officers in CID may find Hathaway to be hard to connect to, aloof, or just a smart-arse; but you'd be hard pressed to find a member that actively disliked him. As always, when one of their own was in trouble, they banded together like nobody else.\"Now that we know James is ok, we need to concentrate our efforts on identifying and arresting the people responsible. That will be easier when Sergeant Hathaway is able to make a statement, but we can make a start by looking for any cars reported stolen that would match the tracks that Forensics uncovered. Thank you for your time and effort, I know some of you should be off duty now.\" She smiled and the officers went back to what they were doing, calling search parties back to base, and making enquiries into stolen vehicles.\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Lewis hurried to the John Radcliff as fast as he could. James had jokingly metioned that Robbie better be his listed next of kin once, since he spent the most time with him. This was after Lewis had complained about the difficulty in tracing them. He never thought that James would actually follow up on it. For that was what the call had been; the hospital calling him, not in a lawful capacity, but a personal one.\u00a0Once he reached the HDU front desk he asked after Hathaway as patiently as he could. He'd been told that James wasn't in any particular danger, but he needed to see for himself.\"He's in bed seven Inspector. I think his parents are with him now.\" His parents? James has never mentioned his parents, and Robbie now knows that he is listed as James' emergency contact. His parents have never shown up before. Not when James was shot at Creavecour. Not when he had arsenic poisoning. Not when James had nearly been burnt alive. Not any other time he had needed them. And as far as he is aware, James never asked for them. So what are they doing here now.\u00a0He rounds the corner and quickly makes out bed seven, heading over to it. There's an old couple sitting in chairs by James' bedside and if they are Hathaway's parents, they aren't what Robbie is expecting. For a start, they look a lot more homely and kind that Robbie ever thought James' parents were. As he stands there, he's aware he should introduce himself as James' boss. These two people don't know him from the next man.\"Mr and Mrs Hathaway?\" he asks uncertainly, and they both look up.\"Gracious me no,\" The old lady says, smiling slightly. \"Maud Richardson. And this is my husband Fred.\" Fred extends his hand and shakes Robbie's warmly.\"You must be his boss. He was adamant that we get in contact with you. Lucky that the hospital had your number really. He didn't even give us your name. Not that we can blame him in the circumstances.\" The confusion on Robbie's face must be obvious, because Maud takes his hand in her own and explains.\"We found young James by the side of the road and brought him here.\" Suddenly, she looks up at him, as if she's just realised something. \"You seemed surprised to meet his parents. Are they on their way.\"\"Urm...N-no. I'm not even sure that they are still living. No love lost there if they are either, from what I can tell\"\"Oh the poor lamb,\" Maud says sadly as she looks over at James. Its now that Robbie has a look as well, and he can't help but exhale softly.James is lying, still as can be, with a blanket pulled up to his shoulders. His face is a map of bruises and cuts, and the swelling from earlier has become worse since Fred and Maud found him. His right leg is in a cast. The short blond hair is still stained slightly red above his ear, surrounding a shallow but painful looking gash. What worries Robbie most though, more than the injuries and the various medical sensors attached to James' arms and fingers, is the oxygen mask strapped to his face. The lad is supposed to be out of the woods, both literally and metaphorically. Why does he have breathing assistance? As if reading his mind, Fred gently explains.\"His breathing is fine Mr....\"\"Lewis....Robbie.\" he says, chastising himself for not introducing himself like he'd meant to in the first place.\"His breathing is fine Robbie. But he's really cold, so they are giving him warmed air to get his core temperature up. That's what the doctor said anyway.\" Robbie nodded and lay his hand over James' substantially colder one.\"What happened to you eh kidda? You've had the whole station worried sick.\" Fred and Maud explain what James had managed to tell him about the incident before he passed out, and Robbie makes a quick call to the station so that the officers can use the information. They could be waiting a little while before James is able to make a statement and Robbie wants the bastards that put his sergeant in hospital caught. When he returns, Fred and Maud are getting up, and gathering their things.\"We really need to be leaving. We didn't want to leave him alone to wake up. But your here for him now.\"\"Thank you.\" And Robbie means it with all he has. \"There are far to many people that would have just left him. More still that would have done once they found out he was a copper.\" He struggles a bit with what to say, knowing that really, its James that needs to hear this bit. Knowing equally that he'll never find the right way to tell him, he'll just have to hope James works it out.\"That young man has become a bit like a second son to me over the seven years that we've worked together. If you hadn't helped him, I'd have lost him tonight.\"\"We couldn't have just left him there. We'd never have forgiven ourselves.\" Maud scribbles a phone number and an address down on a little bit of paper, and hands it to Robbie. \"We'd be really grateful, if you let us know how he gets on. Tell him to get in touch when he's feeling better.\" Fred rolled his eyes, but the smile showed his irritation was false.\"If that young man isn't careful, she'll have adopted him before the end of the month.\" Robbie smiles.\"I'll make sure to tell you. Thank you again. I really can't thank you enough.\"\u00a0\u00a0**********************************************\u00a0Four weeks later and James is mostly recovered. His ribs still hurt a little, but its manageable with painkillers. He's given up the plaster cast and crutches in favour of a walking boot, which he's finally got the hang of.Standing in front of the street door, he turns to Robbie.\"I don't know what to say. They saved my life, what can I say to that?\"\"Well, you've said thank you over the phone so many times, I suspect they're beginning to think that's the only word you know. Hello would be a good place to start\" Robbie smiles. \"Just go in James. Give me a text when you're leaving and I'll come and pick you up. I know you're getting good at that boot thing, but the doctors will you if you walk across the whole of Oxford on it. And they'll kill me for letting you.\" James grins. The grin is quickly wiped from his face as Robbie reaches out and pushes the doorbell, before wandering back towards his car. Bastard, James mutters under his breath, but he doesn't mean it really. He only just has time to turn around and scowl at his governor, before the door opens.\"James love! You found us ok then?\"\"Yeah, Robbie gave me a lift. He's had to go and do some shopping but he says hello.\"\"Come in lad. Maud, move and let him past\" Fred grumbles good naturedly from the hallway. Once James has crossed the threshold, Maud stands back to get a good look at him.\"Let me have a look at that handsome face now its not all covered with bruises eh?\" James smiles shyly. He can't remember the last time he was fussed over like this. Although he feels slightly awkward, he also feels loved and for that, he'll put up with the awkwardness.\"I wanted to wait until everything was all healed,\" he says apologetically, pointing at his booted leg. \"But this doesn't come off for a while yet. And I'm back at work next week, so I dont know how much time I'll have free. I doubt Robbie's done any paperwork while I've been off.\" Fred smiled. Robbie had already told them that he'd saved some of the non urgent documentation to stop James being bored when he returned.\"Oh its great that you're well enough to go back James. I'm so happy for you love. But you mind they don't send you out chasing people with that ruddy great boot on your foot eh?\"\"I'll be on desk duties for the next few weeks Maud, no running I promise.\"\"Well, you just see that you stick to it. If your boss sends you out on raids and whatnot, you tell me, and I'll have words with them.\" James grinned. He knew full well he'd be kept on desk duties for ages. He'd have to beg Jean to let him do anything more interesting than filing for a bit.\"Yes Mum.\" He mumbled facetiously, and Maud clipped his playfully around his uncut ear.\"That's enough of your cheek young man.\" She smiled at him, and then suddenly threw her hands in the air. \"Oh goodness me, where are my manners? I should have offered you a drink. Tea James?\"\"Yes please Maud. That would be lovely.\"\u00a0An hour and a half later, and James was full up on tea and home made Victoria sponge. Robbie had come to get him and they'd both been waylaid by Maud, who seemed intent on giving them all their weekly calories in the form of jam and cream.\u00a0When it finally became time to leave, Fred had shook Robbie hand and then James'.\"Its good to see you up and about my lad. You gave us a bit of a fright back then.\"\"I'm sorry. And thank you. I can't begin to know how to repay you. I owe you both my life.\" Maud had flapped her hands at him then, shooing him towards the door, eyes watery.\"Oh don't you start all that James Hathaway. You don't owe us nothin'. Just you look after yourself y'hear me.\" She sniffed at him and tried to wipe her eyes subtly. \"you both look after each other now alright? That's all the thanks we need.\" After James and Robbie had promised to keep each other out of trouble and to keep in touch, they finally managed to leave.\u00a0Once settled in the car, Robbie turned to James.\"I do believe she's adopted you kidda.\" James chuckled softly.\"I think she's adopted you as well.\" Then the chuckle turned to a gentle smile. \"There are worse things to happen to a man.\"\"Aye lad, that there are.\" Robbie said, squeezing Hathaway's shoulder. \"Come on, I'll drive you back home and we can sit with a cuppa and that bloody Blues Brothers film you've been on at me to watch.\"\"Sounds like a plan.\"\n", "24": "\nChapter Text\n\"You'll be a good cat for Laura won't you Monty? Don't cause her any hassle, its good of her to come and look after you like this.\"Or you could just stay here, Monty thinks. He likes this dark haired man, with his old hands and his love of fish and chips. He likes the way that he's allowed onto the sofas and the beds. The other man that used to look after him got very fussy about that. Always mumbling about a 'snark'. Monty had no idea what this human snark was, but it had earned him a lot of irritated mumbling and shooing off piles of papers. But the dark haired man was nice to him, and let Monty sit on the sofa when he was watching TV. And he always stroked him under his chin, which he liked.There was a very tall man that came by quite often as well. He must have had too much kitten food when he was a baby to get that tall. His hair is blond and he fusses Monty as well. His hands aren't as old as the dark haired man's, but he has funny little lumps on them from use. Monty likes it when he's at the door, because that means that he's going to get yummy food. Sometimes its fish, sometimes its beef and sometimes its chicken, with strange flavours on it. But it always gets there the same. The dark haired man goes to the machine and talks into it. A little while later there's someone at the door with a bag of food that smells delicious. The dark haired man will give him a little bit. If he's lucky he can rub round the tall man's legs, and he gives him food as well.\u00a0But now the dark haired man is going to abandon him for a whole night. And to make it worse, the tall man is going with him. Monty doesn't know what a 'conference' is, but he doesn't like them if its going to take his dark haired friend away. The dark haired man doesn't like them either, he's done nothing but grumble about it all week. The doorbell rings.\"Hello Laura, come in.\" The dark haired man mentioned a Laura earlier, she must be the one who's going to feed me. The lady walks in and smiles, giving the dark-haired man a peck on the cheek.\"This must be Monty then,\" she says as she crouches down and offers her hand. He sniffs it tentatively and then rubs his head across the offered hand. He approves of this human. He's still not happy about the dark-haired man leaving him, or the tall one for that matter, but at least he hasn't left him with someone horrible.\"His food is in the cupboard next to the sink, along with his biscuits. If you could feed him tonight, and again tomorrow morning, and change his water, that'd be great. Thanks Laura.\" There was the beep of a car horn outside and Robbie bent down to scratch under his chin. \"That'll be James. See you Laura. Thanks again. See you later Monty.\" How was he going to cope without that for a whole night. He hoped this Laura was good at chin scratching.\u00a0****************************************\u00a0The dark-haired man had been gone for about three hours when Laura fed him. He stalked around her ankles as she changed his water, and jumped up on the breakfast bar when she was mashing up his food.\"Oh no Monty, I know for a fact that Robbie doesn't let you do that.\" Monty was impressed, she was right. He didn't even hiss as she picked him up and put him back on the floor. \"You be patient for a little bit longer.\"\"Miiiiiaow\" He hoped it was pitiful, but she just chuckled.\"Leave off, you're not starving. Look, its all done now. There you go.\" Monty ran to the food bowl eagerly and lapped up some water, before tucking into his dinner with gusto.\u00a0****************************************\u00a0A little while later, Laura was on the sofa watching telly. He leapt up beside her and attempted to climb up on her lap. She gently but firmly pushed him away. Oh no lady, that's not how you do it. I sit on your lap, and you stroke me. He tried again, but it didn't work. Instead the lady called Laura sneezed. Monty felt sorry for her. Sneezing wasn't fun, and humans seemed to get it even worse. The tall man had been here once, after he fell in some water and he had been sneezing a lot. In the end, the dark-haired man had forced him to the sofa with a hot water bottle and a blanket and made him stay there. The tall man had looked very sad all wrapped up and shivery. Monty had made sure to cuddle next to him that night. The tall man had been having furballs and he was trying to be quiet. Monty thought that was stupid to be doing it alone, so he miaowed as loud as he could to wake the dark-haired man. He was only a cat after all. Someone needed to look after the tall man and he could only do so much.\"Monty, no\" Laura said as he tried once again, to sit on her lap. \"You're making me sneeze.\" Well that was ridiculous, how could he make her sneeze? Offended, he stalked off and went to sleep on the dark-haired man's pillow. If Laura didn't want to talk to him, then so be it. He would just go and be not wanted somewhere comfy.\u00a0****************************************\u00a0In the morning, he heard the clink of china and rushed into the kitchen to see Laura putting his food down. He still hadn't forgiven her for ignoring him last night, but she was feeding him, so she obviously didn't hate him too much.Once he'd eaten, Laura threw a ping pong ball around for him. He warmed to her a bit, since she was clearly making the effort and she did look a little bit ill. He took pity on her and walked away after a few minutes.\u00a0After what seemed like years, he heard a key in the door. Monty bounded down the hallway in excitement. When the door opened, he craned his neck and miaowed happily. The dark haired man! He was back! He rubbed himself all around the dark-haired mans ankles and purred as loudly as he possibly could.\"Hey there little fella\" And there it was, that patent chin scratch that he loved so much. \"You missed me then.\"\"Robbie?\"\"Oh sorry James. Come on Monty, budge up and let James in.\" Monty purred louder still as he walked up the hallway a little. And the tall one? Both of them. I wonder if the tall one is staying tonight. The dark-haired man started talking to Laura.\"Laura you look terrible. What's wrong?\"\"I'm allergic to cats.\"\"Oh blimey I didn't know, why didn't you say something?\" Because she wanted to do something nice for you...sometimes, you humans are stupid. Laura confirmed that and the dark-haired man hugged her. Monty revised his opinion of Laura then, she was a nice lady. And she would help him take care of his dark-haired man. And the tall one.\u00a0****************************************\u00a0Later that night, the tall one was lying on the sofa. Monty miaowed softly at him and he budged over to make some room.\"Come on then Mont'. Up you come.\" Having gained the permission, (although he observed that the tall one never actually said no), he curled up in a little ball by the tall ones knees. He felt a hand gently scratching his back and he chirped happily. Shortly after this, the hand went lax and he heard the gentle snuffles that told him that the tall one had fallen asleep. He stayed there for a little bit; the tall one occasionally whimpered in his sleep, and Monty liked to nuzzle him when he did that, sometimes it made him calm again. He wonders if the tall one has anyone to nuzzle him when he doesn't sleep on the dark-haired man's sofa. He hopes so, he doesn't like to think the tall one is all alone at night when he gets scared.\u00a0Tonight though, the tall one must be having nice dreams because he's breathing calmly and there's a tiny smile on his face. Sure now that one of his favourite humans is happy, he jumps down from the sofa and trots into the dark-haired ones bedroom.\u00a0Once he gets there, he curls up against his owner's back, and stretches, before purring deeply and falling asleep.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "25": "\nChapter Text\nHe's busy talking to Anna Kreel's daughter and so he's not aware at first, what James is doing. But when he looks up, its like someone has punched him in the gut.His mind's eye conjures up a picture of a young man, stood atop of a church tower, priestly robes discarded on the floor beside him. He's holding onto the battlements and looking down. Robbie doesn't need to see his face to know that. He knows, instinctively that this is not the first time that James has stood on high, looking for all the world like he's going to jump and Lewis can't shake the feeling, that he has just glimpsed the past.He doesn't give into his instincts and pull James back from the balcony, the lad isn't even close to the edge. He continues talking to the girl, calmly and coolly, although he has no idea why no body else can hear his voice shaking.He watches James carefully for the next few days, convinced in his heart that he's going to get a terrible phone call in the middle of the night, one of the crime scenes he dreads most.And although that day doesn't show up in the days, weeks, months following the case, he can never quite get over the feeling that James is only a temporary fixture on this earth and that one day, he might just be gone.It scares the living daylights out of him.\n", "26": "\nChapter Text\nRobbie's heart sinks as he spots the familiar shape, sprawled on the bench. He can see the bottle glinting in the moonlight, and he's under no illusions as to how Hathaway has spent the last two hours. He sighs, and heads over to the sergeant, sitting down next to him. James doesn't react at all, save to clumsily try and move the bottle out of Lewis' line of sight. It doesn't work, James is too far gone to have good enough coordination, and in any case, Lewis had been sat next to him for a few minutes before James had even attempted to move. When James doesn't start the conversation, Lewis takes it upon himself to try and engage his friend.\"That's not going to solve your problems you know?\u201d\"It will, if your pro'lems are sobriety.\" Lewis shakes his head. The lad's normally clear diction is slurring. He doesn't like seeing James' self-destructive streak. It always means that bad things are on the horizon\"James kidda, the answer isn't at the bottom of a bottle.\"\"No it isn't.\" The younger man goes silent, and Lewis fears that that's all he's going to say. But then James continues;\"Bu' if you forget the queshun, then the answer don't matter.\" A bitter snort accompanies the statement and Robbie's heart aches for the insecure young man sat next to him.\"And have you forgotten the question?\" James stares blankly, before hanging his head, tears in his eyes.\"No\" he says quietly. He sets the bottle down, empty now and looks ahead, trying to keep the emotion off his face. Lewis knows where this is going. Ted Temple's wife. She'd died three hours after they'd walked out of that basement. He'd made sure to tell Hathaway himself. He'd thought the lad had taken it well. But then he'd called James a little later, to tell him to take tomorrow off, and not got a reply. He'd found him sat in the local park, drinking a bottle of wine on his own. It seems James had just put up a front, until he knew he'd be alone. James speaks, voice breaking.\"Why couldn't I stop 'er?\"\u201cYou tried. You did a good job James.\u201d\u201cBut I didn't though? I wasn't quick 'nough, and now she's dead. 'Cause of me.\u201d Lewis knows that at least some of this is the wine talking. But equally, he knows that even sober, James would blame himself.\u201cNo Jim. She's dead, because she shot herself. Its not your fault lad. You did your best, but it all happened too fast.\u201d\u201cSir...\u201d\u201cTell me something James...do you blame the doctors?\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201c-The doctors at the hospital Jim, they couldn't save her. Do you blame them?\u201d\u201cN-No I don't.\u201d\u201cThen why do you blame yourself kidda?\u201d\u201cI jus'...I jus' do.\u201d James slurs, hanging his head. Robbie relents a little. Its not fair to try and make him explain himself when he's drunk like this.\u201cCome on son, I'll drive you back to mine. We'll get some soup into you and you can get some sleep.\u201d James nods and lets himself be led to Lewis' car.\u00a0**********************************************************\u00a0He cooks up some soup and gets James settled on the sofa. The younger man doesn't react too much to any of of this, but Lewis thinks its because of the alcohol rather than any specific brooding.\u201cNight lad. Try and rest a bit okay?\u201d James nods and mumbles quietly.\u201cNight sir.\u201d Robbie squeezes his shoulder, and leaves for his own bedroom. He's careful to leave both his bedroom door and the living room door open so he can hear if James is in distress during the night.He sleeps soundly, and the alcohol James has consumed, while not being particularly healthy, at least means that the younger man sleeps straight though the night. Even if he does wake up with a pounding headache.\u00a0In time, James will come to terms with what has happened in his own way, but until then, all Robbie can do it makes sure the younger man has his support. He doesn't imagine James will ever open up to him any more than he has, but its important that James at least knows that he can.\n", "27": "\nChapter Text\nSometimes, music has a way of really hitting home.Robbie Lewis considers this as he sits on his sofa with a beer and a bag of chips. The radio is on, something mindless playing in the background. He sits there, picking at the chips, that are already going cold, thinking.There's something wrong with James. Something about this case. Lewis can't get a handle on it, not yet. It goes beyond the fact he knew the victim. Robbie had to admit that he was taken aback when James pretty much sprinted out of the church. True, James doesn't like dead bodies, he's seen the lad's face when they speak to Laura sometimes. But still, James has never reacted that badly before.\u00a0Of course, it'd then come out that he knew Will McEwan.\u00a0Robbie frowns, he knows he should take James off of the case, despite what the young man says. But he can't bring himself to do it, because he knows that James will see it as a lack of trust. And truth be told, he'd feel better about this whole mess, if he can keep an eye on his sergeant. Which is a lot easier if the man is in the office with him. What ever is going on, Robbie hopes that James will explain soon.And there is something going on. Standing outside the reverend King's house, Lewis knew there was something wrong. For a start, Hathaway was drinking one of those energy drinks. It normally coffee. Or a cigarette. Lewis has never seen him drinking energy drinks before.\u00a0Then later, when they went to the pub and Hathaway offered to look for Feardocha's number. He couldn't pretend that he hadn't seen James knock that scotch back. He'd been surprised enough when James had ordered it. Lewis suspects that it wasn't James' first drink of the day.\u00a0Hathaway's behaviour, reminds him of Ken, when he went through his rebellious teenage stage. Drinking too much, out late. He doesn't reckon that James was much of a rebellious teen. He's probably catching up on it now, albeit a bit late. Stupid lad, knocking back drinks at all hours. Drinking on duty even!He just hopes that James gets it out of his system soon. Whatever it is. He could ask of course, but he knows that could go one of two ways. Either, Hathaway will fob him of and insist that he's fine, or James will sock him one. Lewis is in no hurry to find out how good James' hay-maker is.No, whatever is wrong, James will have to get over it himself. He just hope it doesn't affect the lad's work, he may be able to turn a blind eye, but Innocent won't.Robbie gets up to heat up one of the 'pierce and ping's' he has in the fridge. He realises that he knows the song that's playing now. He sings along, he can't help it, its just one of those songs and sod it, there's no one there to hear him.Its only during the chorus at the end, that the lyrics of the song really hit him. Square in the face.\u00a0\nCarry on my wayward son.\n\nThere'll be peace when you are done.\n\u00a0He does see James as a son doesn't he? He didn't really notice before, the feeling's crept up on him. But he has hated watching the man this past week. Hated watching him seemingly fall apart, hated the knowledge that the kid is less than happy.James comes across as a youngster, and its nothing to do with the fact that Lewis is twenty-seven years his senior. He has a vulnerability that cuts Lewis to the quick, brings out his protective instincts.\u00a0\nLay your weary head to rest.\n\nDon't you cry no more.\n\u00a0He'd never have guessed that Hathaway would nearly be granted eternal rest a few nights later.He'd never have guessed that he'd have to turn to the lyrics of a rock ballad for help, when James turns up at his house the night after he gets out of hospital, shaking and on the verge of tears.The song makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand up every time he hears it for a good few years afterwards.\u00a0\n"}, "Published:": "2015-07-26", "Category:": ["Gen"], "Archive Warning:": ["Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings"], "Hits:": "2100", "Kudos:": "50", "Summary": "\nA series of unconnected one shots.

The man had been away for two years on secondment to the British Virgin Islands and will come back into what is now James\u2019s territory.  Even Chief Superintendent Innocent hadn\u2019t questioned him beyond an \u201care you sure?\u201d\u201cI am.  It\u2019s my...\u201d  James hadn\u2019t even had to finish the sentence and she\u2019d nodded.   He is the only Sentinel on her force and his protective streak runs deep.  She wonders how frustrating it must be to not be in charge.  It\u2019s one of the reasons, she just says: \u201cJust get him back here quickly, DI Knox will not be happy if you swan off all day.\u201d  James had nodded.  DI Knox was never happy with him, despite enjoying the benefits of James\u2019 enhanced senses.  \u201cOf course.\u201d  That could be because DI Knox is not the guide he\u2019d like to be and won\u2019t get any advancement out of bonding with James.  He shudders at the thought. \u201cGood, safe journey.\u201d  She hands him an envelope containing papers and a key.  \u201cPlease give this to DI Lewis.  Sandra will be able to give you his home address.\u201d*****The airport is noisy, even at 7 o\u2019clock in the morning.  In the arrivals area, people are hugging and running towards each other.  James is holding up a sign labelled \u2018Lewis\u2019 courtesy of Sandra.  The electronic arrivals board indicates that the flight landed half an hour ago and allowing for baggage collection and passport control, James thinks DI Lewis must be coming through soon.   He is proved right when a man in his fifties, dressed in a colourful Hawaiian shirt walks in, pushing a trolley covered in suitcases and a lei of flowers around his neck.\u201cOh, you\u2019re here for me?\u201d  Before James can answer, a stewardess stops DI Lewis and hands him two large bouquets of flowers.  The ends are still dripping, so he presumes they must have kept them in water.\u201cOh, thank you\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I forgot\u2026 thank you so much.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.  Welcome back.  I\u2019m DS James Hathaway.\u201d\u201cRobbie Lewis, but then you know that, lad.\u201d James nods.  He has to concentrate on walking as the sweet cloying smell of the flowers overwhelms him.   They make their way to the car park, James just concentrating on every step.  It is hard, his nose is working overtime.  The flowers are powerful but beneath he can smell sweat and a musky note that must be DI Lewis.He is so distracted that James is almost getting run over by a red Jaguar but DI Lewis pulls him back just in time.  The hand on his wrist calms him and suddenly James is centred and back with the world.  They apologise to the angry driver who pulls off after swearing at them.   \u201cThanks, Sir.\u201d  \u201cCall me Robbie, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m your DI, is it?\u201d James takes a couple of deep breaths and dials down his smell.  Instead he concentrates on sound and sight to prevent this happening again.  He doesn\u2019t say anything when he notices that Robbie\u2019s hand is still on his wrist as they carry on walking.   James misses the touch when they get to the car and he loads the suitcases into the boot and backseat. *****\nThe drive is silent as James concentrates on the road.  DI Lewis is obviously jetlagged if his yawning is anything to go by.\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d\u201cYour flat.  Oh, and DCS Innocent has given me an envelope for you.  It\u2019s in the glove compartment.\u201d  James remembers now.\u201cThanks.  And we need to stop at the graveyard first before we go anywhere.\u201dJames nods.  \u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201cWolvercote.\u201d  \u201cOf course.\u201d*****\nRobbie yawns again.  He\u2019s gotten some sleep on the flight but it hadn\u2019t been enough.  Being collected by a DS had been a surprise, that DS being a Sentinel even more.  Robbie had sensed it immediately but then the stewardess had come with the flowers for Val and Morse.  How could he forget those?  The letter is a distraction from his morose thoughts.  \u201cDear Robbie,I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t collect you in person, but as you know, I have retired and the eyes\u2026 well, age waits for no man.  That doesn\u2019t stop you from coming round for a cuppa\u2026 or a pint.  If you don\u2019t, I still have friends who will make sure you turn up...  in the nicest possible way, of course.  Your tenants have moved out and the flat is all yours.  So, get on with your life.  Neither of them would want you to mope and be unhappy.  Not that Morse would ever use the word mope.  He\u2019d just get you to order the next pint.  And Val, well, she\u2019d be upset that you\u2019re not happy. I hope to see you again soon.  With best wishes,Jim Strange.\u201dRobbie sighs, it\u2019s all changed, all different.  He takes a glance at the man next to him.  It still doesn\u2019t make sense why a Sentinel Detective Sergeant would want to collect him.  Robbie would have been quite happy to get himself a train ticket back to Oxford.  After all, he\u2019s not been there for two years.  Jim Strange had understood his need to get away, to run away from the pain.And now he\u2019s back, feeling like a spare part.  Morse and Val are still dead and he\u2019s alone.  But it had worked, the pain is not as sharp as it had been.  Robbie closes his eyes and rests, after all the journey will take a couple of hours.\u201cWe are here, Sir.  You should wake up...\u201d  The hand on Robbie\u2019s wrist is warm and his skin suddenly tingles.  Robbie represses the memory, there is no chance that... ever\u2026 again.\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u201cOxford, won\u2019t be long until we get to Wolvercote.\u201d  James Hathaway explains and Robbie yawns.  \u201cShall we stop for a coffee first?\u201d  The young man asks but Robbie declines. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d  Robbie needs to see them.  Coffee can wait.It is sunny and bright as he stands in front of Morse\u2019s grave.  His Sentinel, his teacher, his guv\u2019nor for so many years, gone because his heart had given in to too many pints and late night take outs.  \u201cYou daft sod, should have come round for dinner more often, all that muck.\u201d  Not that Morse had ever wanted to intrude.  \u201cShe loved you too, you know?  She insisted on me guiding you, I don\u2019t think I ever told you that.\u201dRobbie lets the memories wash over him.  Morse had been as remote as a Sentinel could be from his Guide.  He hadn\u2019t wanted to break up Robbie\u2019s marriage and somehow they had made it work for fifteen years.  Val had wanted them to be closer but Morse had never allowed it.\u201cYou married her\u2026\u201d  That\u2019s all he\u2019d said and Robbie hadn\u2019t disagreed but still.  Robbie\u2019s eyes flicker to the other end of the cemetery where he\u2019ll be going next.\u201cHi luv.\u201d  He stands over Val\u2019s grave, the flowers heavy in his hand.   She had been perfect for him, never wavering in her support, especially when he had met a Sentinel who needed him.  \u201cOf course you bond.  It\u2019s not even up for discussion.\u201d  There had been a fierce resolution mixed with the tears she was fighting back.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d  That had been pretty much all he\u2019d been able to say.\u201cYou tell me he doesn\u2019t want a traditional bond.  Nothing sexual.  And we\u2019ve survived you spending two years in vice without being tempted.  Well, I can live with that.  I will not see him suffer because of me.  It\u2019s not the biggest hardship to change to a Sentinel friendly shower gel.\u201dAnd that had been that.  Life had been split into work and solving cases with Morse, offering support and being a Guide.  Morse had not asked for much, just touching his arms and sometimes holding him, listening to Robbie\u2019s heartbeat.  \u201cThanks luv.  I miss you.\u201dHe misses her home cooked pies and how she\u2019d brought up Lyn and Tom while he\u2019d gone out and caught murderers.  He might have been the steadying force for Morse, but Val had been the centre of his own world, the sun with Morse as moon.  \u201cMaudlin, this is what this is.\u201d  Robbie grimaces before stepping away. *****\nJames is an intruder.  For some reason he is standing there, in a graveyard between the dead.  Grief is pouring off DI Lewis as if his Sentinel Endeavour Morse had been more than a friend, more like a wife.  But that can\u2019t be because the emotion feels the same as he puts the second bunch of flowers down.  To James it seems as if they had died yesterday and not three years ago according to the tombstone.  It makes his own desires feel wrong.  To distract himself, James pulls out his smartphone and sends a quick e-mail to DCS Innocent.  The ping that indicates a reply is noisy in the quiet sunshine.  A quick read and he sighs.  A case and DI Knox is the officer in charge.  That means James has to take Robbie home and then meet Laura Hobson, Medical Examiner at the scene.*****\nRobbie leaves the graveyard with a slightly lighter heart.  At least he can visit them now.  Thinking about it, he should phone Lyn, let her know he\u2019s arrived safely.  Tom in New Zealand will be asleep.  Time zones are a killer as his own yawning is proving.  \u201cI need to drop you off at the police station, if that\u2019s okay, Sir.  I\u2019ve pulled a case.\u201d  James explains.  \u201cThat way you can meet DCS Innocent.\u201dRobbie yawns once again and agrees.  He is not really keen to go back to the empty flat.  \u201cI may need that coffee then.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe drive in the post rush hour streets is smooth when James suddenly slows the car.  Robbie can see a man in a large SUV being breathalysed on the side of the dual carriageway.\u201cThat\u2019s DI Knox, my DI.  I must go straight to the scene.  I presumed he\u2019d be there.\u201d James offers an explanation before speeding up again. \u201cThat was an immediate suspension in my day.\u201d\u201cWorse, sackable offence now.\u201d  James points out and Robbie thinks he can hear just a smidgen of glee.  So, not the best of friends then?\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you take me with you?\u201d  The words are out of his mouth before he can censor himself.  Nice as the British Virgin Islands were (more sunbathing than crime) \u2013 he missed this. James seems to consider Robbie\u2019s suggestion and then nods.  \u201cWhen do you return to duty officially?\u201dRobbie grimaces.  \u201cHasn\u2019t been confirmed yet.\u201d  It had been difficult enough to deal with time zones and paperwork to end the attachment and that had been without any problems, Robbie had wanted to come back.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Innocent if you want.  She will understand.\u201d  James sounds sure of himself and Robbie doesn\u2019t doubt him.  And he hopes Laura Hobson will back him up.  She\u2019d worked with him and Morse in the past.  ******\n\u201cOkay, you can have the case until DI Garland returns from her court case.  She can take over.  But then I want you to think about the training academy\u2026 I have enough DIs.\u201d  Jean Innocent is not pulling her punches and James can see DI Lewis rock back at the force of her words.\u201cI did teaching in the Islands.  It didn\u2019t suit me.\u201d  Robbie points out but there is no softening in her stance. \u201cMa\u2019am, may I have a word, alone?\u201d  James has stood silently next to DI Lewis after they had briefed her on the dead body.\u201cOf course.\u201d He waits until the DI has left and the door is closed.\u201cHe is my Guide.\u201d  The look of surprise is well worth it.  \u201cAre you sure?  Him?\u201dJames is aware that he has been hiding his need to touch Robert Lewis.  \u201cYes.  I felt it when I met him.\u201d\u201cSo, why are you are here and not in some hotel room \u2018bonding\u2019?\u201d  She almost sneers the words.  It explains a lot\u2026 like being stuck with DI Knox.\u201cBecause he\u2019s not aware yet.  Or if he is, he\u2019s not let on.\u201d  James admits.  \u201cWe are all individuals.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.  Okay, you stay with him on this case.\u201d  James hears dismissal in her voice, so he turns to leave as she continues to talk.  \u201cAnd if you bond\u2026 just let me know.\u201dJames leaves the office and is surprised to find Robbie outside.  \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d\u201cMy suitcases are in your car.\u201d  Yeah, that makes sense.  \u201cShall I take you home, Sir?\u201d\u201cMight as well, nothing else we can do tonight until Laura has some results.  We can start asking questions tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019ll need groceries as well?\u201d  James wonders out loud. \u201cPizza and some cereal will do.\u201d So that is what they get from the local supermarket not far from where he drops DI Lewis off.  They take the cases into the small two bedroom house at the outskirts of Oxford.  It is neat and soulless.\u201cDo you want to come in for coffee\u2026 or tea?\u201d\u201cNot fed up with me yet?\u201d  James can\u2019t help asking, hoping at the same time he will not be sent away.\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019d like you to stay.\u201d  James just nods and steps into the small kitchen.  He doesn\u2019t say what he really feels: I want to drink you in, touch you, bond.Once they sit down, James decides to talk about the elephant in the room, poke the hornets\u2019 nest or wake a sleeping bear, whatever the appropriate expression is.  \u201cYou are my Guide\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.  I had hoped you\u2019d not notice.\u201d  That is a surprise.  \u201cI can\u2019t do it.  I won\u2019t do it.\u201dJames can guess but he has to ask.  \u201cBecause you lost them?\u201d\u201cYes, and because I\u2019m damaged and old.  You need someone better than me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNo but.  I will not bond with you.\u201dThere is nothing James can say, that much is sure.  So he does the honourable thing.  \u201cI will collect you in the morning.  For eight, is that suitable?\u201d\u201cMake it nine\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d  James resists the urge to touch Robbie again.  He wants to hold him, comfort him, love him and forsake all others. Instead he leaves and makes his way to his own flat a couple of miles away.The flat is empty and he curls up in his bed, not caring that he\u2019s still in his suit.  *****\nTo Robbie\u2019s surprise, it is James who collects him at about quarter to nine.  He hasn\u2019t been palmed off on a poor Constable. \u201cGood morning, Sir.  Dr Hobson has requested our presence.\u201d\u201cThank you, James.  Let\u2019s go.\u201dThey ignore the conversation from the night before and concentrate on trying to solve the case instead.  Regan Peverill deserves that much after being found dead in a sleep laboratory.Laura Hobson confirms that the young woman has been shot and that she was able to retrieve a bullet.  \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a small calibre but I\u2019ve sent it to forensics to confirm.\u201d\u201cThanks Laura.\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t say it yesterday, I\u2019m very glad to see you back.\u201dRobbie just nods.  \u201cThanks again.  We better try and figure this out.\u201d\u201cI miss him too\u2026 crotchety guy he was.  Did you say she sent something of a Daniel Griffon?  That name rings a bell.\u201d\u201cSon of Rex Griffon, racing driver.  Heir to the company once he turns 21.\u201dOnce they are back at the police station, Robbie requests the file of the death of Rex Griffon a decade or so earlier.  He gulps when he finds a half completed crossword attached to a photo of Rex Griffon.   Morse\u2019s handwriting had always been old fashioned and neat.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d  Hathaway stands close to him, not quite crowding but always within touching distance.  It is hard not to follow the impulse.  Robbie wants.\u201cYes, now do we have anything else on the family?\u201d\u201cI have an address, we need to see them, Sir.\u201d  James holds out a piece of paper.\u201cI\u2019ve been there before.\u201d*****\nWhen they return to the station, James concentrates on the case as they discover the complicated family set up of the Griffons.  What he really wants is to touch Robert Lewis\u2019s skin and close the bond.  The urge is overwhelming and eventually he makes his way to DCS Innocent\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s not going away.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  James hates being so vulnerable.  \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I can force him to bond with me.  But he\u2019s the one.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read his file, did you know that he\u2019d been a guide to DI Morse?  Fifteen years?\u201d  She sounds astonished. James grimaces. It explains a lot.  No wonder the man doesn\u2019t want to risk any more pain.  But it doesn\u2019t change the facts.\u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d  \u201cNot sure he\u2019d appreciate it if you told him that. Okay, leave it with me.\u201dJames does and makes his way straight back to the open plan office. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been lad, we\u2019ve got another body.  Daniel Griffin.  Suspected suicide.\u201d  They leave the office quickly, James again trying not to crowd DI Lewis.  At the river James is surprised to find that the back of his hand is touching Robbie\u2019s and it\u2019s not taken away.  The skin tingles and James feels calmer.  Suddenly his senses seem sharper and his heart slows down.\u201cThat\u2019s not a suicide\u2026 wrong oars and they are on the wrong side as well.\u201d  \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI took part in the boat race for Cambridge, we won.\u201d  James admits and surprised to be met by an admiring glance. The rest of the day is fruitless. \u201cShall I drive you home, Sir?\u201d  \u201cI need a pint.  Then you can drive me home.\u201d  To James\u2019s surprise it is pleasant sitting in a quaint pub drinking an orange juice.  He\u2019s not risking following DI Knox out of the force.   Dialling up his hearing, James sips his drink and listen\u2019s to Robbie\u2019s heartbeat, drowning out the rest of the patrons. *****\nRobbie must be mad.  He\u2019s let James touch him and it had felt good.  Right now, instead of running away, he\u2019s in a pub with the lad, not wanting to part with him just yet. \u201cSo, Cambridge, eh?  How did you end up here in Oxford?\u201d  He doesn\u2019t know anything about the Sentinel.  He is sure Innocent would have given him a file but it\u2019s not the same.  Words on paper don\u2019t tell the whole story.\u201cIt\u2019s the last place they\u2019d look for me.\u201d  James laughs wryly.  \u201cI studied theology but then had to leave the seminary.\u201dOh great... a god botherer.  \u201cYou came online.\u201dIt is well known that the Catholic church does not allow online Sentinel and Guides to become priests.  Demanding a celibate lifestyle is considered cruel for them.  \u201cYes, a few weeks before I was due to take my vows.\u201d Robbie thinks that must have been tough.  \u201cI came online during a stint with vice, up north.  Val \u2026 well, she wanted to get away, so I got a job down here.  Hence Oxford.\u201d   Robbie decides to reciprocate.  \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cMe too, though I\u2019d have loved my old DI to see me now.   To quote: you\u2019re too northern to get promoted.\u201d  Robbie chuckles.  \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not ferrying DI\u2019s around?\u201d  Robbie is aware that they have hardly been apart.\u201cI play in a band\u2026 guitar.\u201dNot the classical stuff he\u2019d suffered through with Morse then.  \u201cRock?\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019d classify it as world music\u2026\u201dRobbie imagines hippies and then shakes himself.  This is only temporary, he won\u2019t ever have to listen to it.\u201cI should be at rehearsal actually.\u201d  James admits.\u201cSo, what are you doing here then?  Don\u2019t let me stop you.  I can get a taxi home.\u201d  Robbie tells him, ignoring the fact that it would hurt if James accepted his offer. \"No, that's okay.  We don't have any concerts lined up.  By the way, when are you getting your car?\"\"Fed up of being a chauffeur already?  Well, I can understand that.  Saturday.\"  Robbie explains.   \u201cI can get a rental if you want.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.  It\u2019s only a couple more days.\u201d\u201cThanks, so how long have you been in Oxford?\u201d\u201cA year, just a bit shorter than DCS Innocent.  She has been here about eighteen months.\u201dThat Robbie had known.  DCS Strange had warned him before the secondment to the British Virgin Islands started.  Change was supposed to be as good as a rest. \u201cAt least Gurpreet is still here.  If you ever need help with computers, he\u2019s the man to go to.\u201d  Robbie advises.\u201cI know. He\u2019s been most helpful.  DI Knox likes\u2026 liked to use him as well.\u201dThey keep talking and by the time Robbie gets home, the ten o\u2019clock news are over.  They\u2019d supplemented their drinks with fish and chips from the local chippie.  \u201cMissing the deep fried Mars bar?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even further north.  Now, do you want to come in?\u201d  Robbie asks.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine Sir.  I will see you tomorrow.  Your results should be in.\u201dRobbie nods and closes the car door behind him.  The flat is dark and empty.  He might as well get used to that.  Other single people experience it all the time.  For a moment he rubs the wedding ring on his left hand, the cold metal a reminder of the costs a relationship exacts.  *****\nThursday morning leads to a third murder in the Griffon family, this time a close family friend who has an affair with Daniel Griffon\u2019s mother who lives in the same house.  \u201cTom Pollock\u2019s death makes three.  Really, DI Lewis, could you please solve this case?  The press are making noises.  Especially as they have figured out that you were involved in the first case.\u201d\u201cI understand Ma\u2019am.\u201d  There is nothing else to say after all to the angry DCS. \u201cGood, now get out of here.\u201dBack at the DI Knox\u2019s old desk, Robbie picks up the old file again.  Morse\u2019s clues suddenly make sense.  Tom Pollock \u2013 Polo \u2013 Polonius\u2026 Hamlet.  \u201cMorse thought Trudi Griffon had an affair with her brother in law\u2026 but it was Tom Pollock instead.  That explains why they had to keep Tom\u2019s daughter away from Daniel.\u201d  He shudders.  Infidelity is such an ugly thing. \u201cSo, who killed Daniel?\u201d  James asks for clarification and Robbie explains. \u201cI have another suspect for that.\u201d  \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about maths\u2026 that tutor, Bernard Beech.  He had the time and the motive.  As you told me, she\u2019d figured him out.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s got his wife at home\u2026 who is dying of motor-neurone disease.\u201d  \u201cYes, with his reputation that will be lost.  One thing too many.  And with a clock that wasn\u2019t right as you noticed. \u201d  Robbie can\u2019t quite hold back the pride he feels in the Sentinel.   *****\nJames smells the poison on their suspect, but it is too late, the wife is dead. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let her suffer anymore.\u201dRobbie gags next to him before ordering the accompanying police constable to cuff Mr Beech.  \u201cI am arresting you for the murders of Regan Peverill, Daniel Griffon, Tom Pollock and the attempted murder of Mrs Kate Jekyll.\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s dead.\u201d  James can\u2019t help point out.   There is no heartbeat or breath coming from the bed upstairs.  James wants to beat that man to a pulp and steps forward.\u201cStop. We need a doctor to prove that first.  And if you beat him up, he\u2019ll get less than he deserves.\u201d    Robbie\u2019s stedy voice and a hand on his wrist calm him down.  James knows that\u2019s the case but he wants to see the man suffer.  \u201cHe killed four people over his reputation.  A family is broken.  Lives that won\u2019t get lived.\u201d\u201cThey were already broken. Daniel wasn\u2019t his father\u2019s son, he was Tom\u2019s and they\u2019d have had to tell Tom\u2019s daughter that she couldn\u2019t get courted by Daniel.\u201dCourted, such an old-fashioned word.  James wonders if that\u2019s what he needs to do, court his Guide.  Not that he has a clue on how to do that \u2013 or that it\u2019s even an option.  Last night\u2019s rejection had been incredibly clear.*****\n\u201cWell done, DI Lewis.\u201dDCS Innocent\u2019s praise sounds unwillingly given but Robbie will take that.  \u201cThank you ma\u2019am.  Have you had a thought about me staying, now that DI Knox has left?\u201d  Might as well\u201cYes\u2026 I have read up.  And I understand that you are DS Hathaway\u2019s Guide.\u201d\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am.  I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cThat is not what he has told me.\u201dNext to him Robbie can feel James jerk and automatically puts his hand on the Sentinel\u2019s wrist.  He pulls him closer and surrenders himself to the inevitable.\u201cWhat do you want, Ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201cYou can stay, but you will agree to be a, what do they call them, Conservator to DS Hathaway.  Otherwise, that training placement at the Academy is still open to you.\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am, you can\u2019t do that.  That\u2019s blackmail.\u201d  James sounds disgusted.  \u201cDI Lewis has been a conservator before, he knows what to do.  And you need someone.  I have read the reports by DI Knox about your zone outs and even worse, the almost feral attacks when you catch the criminals.  That is dangerous in your profession.  So, will you accept DI Lewis as your Conservator?\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d  Hathaway\u2019s question is quietly asked but Robbie knows the answer already.\u201cThen I\u2019d have to ask you to leave.  I cannot risk my force\u2019s reputation \u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d  Robbie bursts out before she can even finish her threat.  They\u2019ve seen what reputation can cost, nothing is worth that. \u201cThank you, DI Lewis.  I let you work out the details.  See you both in the office on Monday.\u201dDCS Innocent dismisses them. *****\nJames shakes as they step outside the office.  Sandra, the secretary, has long gone home.  \u201cTake me to your flat.  We will talk.\u201d  Robbie announces and James nods.  The other man has experience James lacks right now.   They walk silently through the open office, collecting their coats, keys and wallets. \u201cSo, are you staying, Sir?\u201d  Gurpreet turns to DI Lewis as they pass by his workstation where he is analysing information from another case.\u201cYes, you can tell the rumour mill that I am staying.\u201d  Robbie confirms.  \u201cThat\u2019s good news, Sir.  If you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d  The younger man smiles and turns back to his screen. \u201cI don\u2019t.  Thanks Gurpreet.  And don\u2019t stay too long... it\u2019s the weekend.\u201d  Robbie sounds almost cheerful and it jars.  James concentrates on the road, trying to remember what he has in his fridge and freezer that could make a quick meal.  They won\u2019t want to go out.  He decides on pasta with a quick sauce from a jar.The light in the flat is dull but they don\u2019t need to close the curtains just yet.\u201cCan I offer you something?  A drink, food?\u201d\u201cIn a bit.  We need to talk, Sentinel.\u201d  James stands up straighter.  Words form and then get discarded.  He wants to touch, close the bond but his Guide wants to talk.  So James sits down on his couch and is relieved to find that he is joined by Robbie although the gap is larger than he would like.  He turns so he can see Robbie\u2019s face and leans against the arm rest with his elbow. \u201cWhat are your conditions, Guide?\u201d James doesn\u2019t want any but senses that won\u2019t be an option.\u201cNo intimacy...!\u201d  That is burst out but James had guessed that sex was off the agenda.  He hoped it would only be for now.  \u201cBut you can saturate yourself on me through touch and smell.\u201d  James exhales a breath he\u2019d not remembered holding.  Then he breathes in deeply to capture Robbie\u2019s scent.  It\u2019s a mixture of sweat and something undefinable that James now craves.  He is pleased that there are no scents from shower gels or after shaves mask Robbie\u2019s smell like the flowers at the airport had done.  But even then, he\u2019d just known.  During his police sponsored training there had been a long seminar on accepting conservatory Guides and he can still hear the warnings.  \u2018Your conservator is temporary.  They will help you learn to focus your senses.  They will leave.  You will hurt but you will move on.  And when you find your Guide, it will hurt them.\u2019 \u201cWhy only a conservator?\u201d  James has to ask.  Every fibre in him wants more, wants it all.  He leans forward to take in the answer. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to be your father.  And I\u2019m not letting you suffer from a broken heart when I die.\u201d  Robbie explains, rubbing the wedding finger on his left hand.  \u201cIt will hurt\u2026 less.\u201dJames is not convinced but what does he know?  It\u2019s not as if he has ever lost anyone.  He is not sure his family counts in this instance.\u201cYou are not that old.\u201d  James has to point that out.\u201cLad, how old are you?\u201dJames feels older than he is, but he gives the number anyway: \u201cI\u2019ve just turned thirty\u2026 thankfully nobody noticed.\u201d\u201cWell, they will notice that I\u2019m fifty four and almost eligible for drawing my pension.  Innocent was already planning to put me out to pasture.  My Lyn turned thirty not long ago herself and is talking grandchildren.\u201d  Robbie puts it bluntly and James nods, not really able to say anything sensible.  \u201cI will not rob you of finding your Sentinel, of having a family.\u201dJames nods again, this time having an answer.  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want a family?  It\u2019s not as if they allow priests to have them.\u201d  He\u2019d long ago resigned himself to not passing on his genes. Robbie seems to take that in and then surprises James by taking off his jacket and opening the buttons on his shirt.  There is a smattering of dark hair on his Guide\u2019s chest peppered with silvery streaks.\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201dNot the most ringing endorsement, but James doesn\u2019t really care right now.  He follows suit and takes off his own jacket and shirt.  \u201cSentinel, I pledge myself to be your temporary Guide, to be your focus and your teacher for as long as it takes.\u201d  The formal words of a conservator bond sting but he had learned the response: \u201cGuide, I pledge myself to be your Sentinel, to guard and protect you and to learn from you for as long as it takes.\u201dBefore he can stop himself, James leans forward and puts his ear against the rough chest.  His Guide\u2019s heartbeat is fast and James takes a deep breath.  The smell is intoxicating and he lets his hands roam over the shoulders.  The shirt is in the way, so he pushes it back further.  Robbie\u2019s pulse is visible on his neck.  Impulsively, James licks it, tasting Robbie for the first time.  *****\nJames\u2019s tongue is rough against Robbie\u2019s pulse and for a moment he wonders what kissing them would feel like.  That is followed by a deep sense of betrayal.  Hasn\u2019t it only been three days since he\u2019d stood before their graves?  That doesn\u2019t stop his dick reacting or his libido kicking back in after three years of a dreamless sleep.  Almost reflexively his arms pull around his Sentinel\u2019s back and feels the strength in the muscles.  Robbie holds James close, feeling the warmth against his chest, lips against his neck.Suddenly James moves and straddles him, hard erections meeting only separated by their trousers.  \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  Robbie wants to pull away but his Guide\u2019s body holds him down. \u201cI am sorry\u2026\u201d James gets up like a shot but still holds on to Robbie\u2019s shoulders, not relinquishing the touch entirely.\u201cJust not yet\u2026\u201d  Robbie is surprised at his own words.  \u201cCome, sit with me again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make that drink now.\u201d  James steps away and Robbie is alone.  He misses the touch already.  James comes back, holding two steaming mugs.  Putting them on the table, he re-joins Robbie on the sofa.  Their hands touch and Robbie wraps his fingers around James\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d  The words escape Robbie.  He is, wishing the young man was spared all this.\u201cNobody said it would be easy.\u201d  James grimaces and then draws close again.Robbie pulls him even closer and whispers \u201cSit down as before.\u201dJames obeys with alacrity and he holds him tight.  Robbie\u2019s erection has vanished but just holding his Sentinel... his temporary Sentinel soothes him.  He drinks in the smell and feels the soft skin and taut muscles of James\u2019 back.  \u201cThis is good.\u201d  Robbie admits.\u201cThank you, Guide.\u201d  James is very formal and Robbie accepts that.  He ignores James\u2019s hard cock and concentrates on that bond their minds are forming.  Robbie is overly aware that James is tense and he wants him to relax.  Feel safe.\u201cI\u2019ve got you, Sentinel.\u201d  Robbie bestows a little kiss on James\u2019s cheek and leans back into the back of the sofa.  \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d******\nRoutine takes over their lives.  As much routine as a Detective Inspector and Detective Sergeant can have when cases come in at all times of the day.  James learns that his DI works idiosyncratically and that he likes that.  Even DCS Innocent is getting used to it although it takes her longer.They go to work, James deals with the paperwork and technology.  His Guide teaches him by solving cases and thinking outside the box.  The evenings are usually spent first in a pub and then at one of their homes. Here James can let his senses drink in, sitting on his Guide\u2019s lap before either going home or letting Robbie leave.  He\u2019s learned to deal with his erections on his own.  He doesn\u2019t know if Robbie does the same, but somehow doubts it.  The shadows of Val and Morse loom large. They have kept themselves away from others, allowing James to feel safe. \u201cHow are you, James?  It\u2019s ages since I saw you?  We\u2019re missing you at rehearsals.\u201d  Fiona corners him in the staff room one day at lunch.  She stands a yard away from him but he can still smell her arousal.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been busy.  I\u2019ve been to Berlin.  I found my Guide.\u201dBefore meeting Robbie, James had considered asking the blonde DS out.  But then she\u2019d joined the band and he found out she\u2019s a Sentinel like him\u2026 and it had never happened.  Instead they\u2019d become friends over the odd cup of coffee in the staff room.  Even though she would like to be more and he\u2019s sorry he won\u2019t ever be able to give her that. \u201cOh, I knew that one.  Do you have time for a coffee?  We\u2019re rehearsing tonight.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come to that.  We can have the coffee after.\u201d  James decides.  He needs a distraction. \u201cSounds  great.  I\u2019ll meet you at the Fox tonight.\u201d  James nods and takes two mugs of coffee back with him to the office he and Robbie now share.  It is better than being in an open plan area with lots of smells and noises that just distract him.\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight.  The old band is meeting\u2026 rehearsals.\u201d  James announces as he puts down the hot drinks. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m your gaoler.\u201d  Robbie seems distracted and James takes it.  \u201cAny progress on the results?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 they are related.  Father and son.\u201d\u201cGood, we\u2019ll question the mother again.\u201d  Lewis gets up.By the end of the day, the case is closed, another murder solved, another family torn apart.\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Sir.  The band\u2019s waiting.\u201d  At half past six, James gets ups.  \u201cOf course, see you tomorrow.\u201dJames is dismissed.   He drives home and picks up his guitar.  The rehearsal takes place in the garage of a pub near the river Thames.  The Fox and Hound is also one of the places that lets them play.The music soothes him as they fall into familiar rhythms.  He is welcomed back like the prodigal son and the warmth envelops him.After a couple of hours, Fiona and James leave to have a drink in the pub.  \u201cNot drinking?\u201d  Fiona is surprised at his order of orange juice.\u201cI usually drive\u2026 and got to get home.  Don\u2019t really want to do a Knox, do I?\u201d\u201cIs that what we call it now?\u201d  Fiona laughs.  \u201cNow, tell me about your Guide.\u201dAnd James does, words tumbling out.  \u201cHe\u2019s still grieving, wearing his wife\u2019s wedding ring.  It\u2019s all platonic.\u201d\u201cOh wow.  Just be glad I\u2019m not part of the rumour mill.  That would keep the meetings round the water coolers occupied for years.\u201d  Fiona laughs but it\u2019s all a bit fake.\u201cInnocent almost forced him to bond, did you know that?\u201d  James asks.  \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t done that maybe Robbie would be more than a conservator now.\u201d\u201cHey, it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve got.\u201d  Fiona admonishes him.  \u201cI\u2019ve got nobody to share this with.\u201d\u201cNot sure this is sharing\u2026 as they told us, having a conservator hurts.\u201d\u201cHey, it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d  \u201cIt is, when you know he is your guide and not just some stop gap.\u201d  James admits finally. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d  \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMan, I don\u2019t envy you.\u201d  Fiona takes a deep drink out of her pint.  \u201cOh, have you heard, I\u2019m going to London.  The Met have asked for me.  I\u2019ll be working for a DI Lestrade\u2026\u201dJames doesn\u2019t have the heart that he\u2019d been approached by them as well.  He\u2019d talked to Robbie but the decision to stay in Oxford had been an easy one for both of them.\u201cSounds exciting.\u201d  That\u2019s not a lie.  It had been tempting, after all Lestrade works with Sherlock Holmes and meeting him would be an adventure.  Apparently.\u201cI can\u2019t wait\u2026 Innocent has requested I honour the three months\u2019 notice, so I\u2019ll still be around a few more weeks.  I\u2019ll tell the band next week.\u201dThey hug and for a moment James is aware that she is so much softer than the hard plane he leans against almost every night.*****\nRobbie kneels before Val\u2019s grave.  It\u2019s her birthday and he\u2019d almost forgotten.  The flowers are from a garage forecourt and not the usual florist.\u201cCan\u2019t believe I almost missed your birthday, pet.\u201d  He puts the flowers down, discarding the ones he\u2019d taken a few months ago.  \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re courting again\u2026 me sneaking out on my parents.  Not that James is a parent, but you know what I mean.\u201dThere is no response, only a few birds calling each other in the trees.  Robbie keeps on talking.  \u201cI miss you\u2026 and the silent one.  Endeavour\u2026 what were his parents thinking?  Lyn and Tom are thanking us, I think.  I never told you, he bequeathed all his worldly goods to a foundation to support young musicians.  The Endeavour award\u2026 considering he never let us use that name.  Only ever Morse.  Last one was won by a girl involved in a case, so proud of her.\u201dLewis thinks.\u201cJames is different, you know.  Clever\u2026 and so beaut\u2026 young.  Did you know he\u2019s just a few months older than our Lyn?  And so stupid too\u2026 he\u2019s not looking for another Guide.  I\u2019m too old for him.\u201d If Robbie repeats this often enough, he might make himself not regret that. \u201cI\u2019m slow and he\u2019s fast.  I\u2019m a plodder and he\u2019s like a gazelle.\u201d  Suddenly it dawns on Robbie that he\u2019s talking about James non-stop. This visit isn\u2019t about that.  He changes tack. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve given up in London trying to find the guy who did this to you.  I had another letter from DI Lestrade you know.  He writes one every year on your birthday.  Says he\u2019s had a \u2018Consulting Detective\u2019 have a look at it.  What is a consulting detective anyway.\u201d*****\nJames checks out of the hotel.  The night with Fiona had turned into an alcohol soaked one once he\u2019d admitted his impossible feelings for his Guide.  They\u2019d shared a twin room (cheaper) and she\u2019s left a few minutes ago.  His head still aches as he uses the stairs to make is way to reception. \u201cMr Monkfort, you\u2019ve forgotten your\u2026\u201d the receptionist tries to get the other guest\u2019s attention but he walks out quickly past James.  His senses tingle but he can\u2019t put a name to it.  His head aches from the oblivion he\u2019d drunk himself into and he ignores it, instead concentrating on standing straight.  \u201cI\u2019d like to check out.  Room 301 and please can you order me a taxi?\u201d\u201cWhere is your car, Mr Hathaway?\u201dJames has think for a moment.  \u201cIn that 24 hour car park.\u201dShe winces and James remember why.  It\u2019s a pretty expensive place but he\u2019s not planning to do a Knox as it\u2019s become known at the station \u2013 or at least by James.  Considering the churning in his stomach, driving is certainly not an option.  His phone rings and he answers it, \u201cYes, Sir.  No, I\u2019m at the Green Square hotel.  Didn\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d\u201cDo a Knox.  Good thinking.  Innocent\u2019s called me.  We\u2019ve pulled a case.\u201d  James tries not to feel hurt at the lack of jealousy after not seeing his Guide.  His own is flaring.  He knows what day it is even if he\u2019s pretending he doesn\u2019t.  \u201cCan you collect me?\u201d******\nThey stop at a one of these coffee chains and James orders himself a latte with two extra shots.  The milk tempers the sharp taste of the espresso and the caffeine will help him to cope.  Adding a couple of paracetamol and a bacon roll, James is good to go.Turns out the murder is straight forward, it is the male partner, living up to the dangerous clich\u00e9.  He confesses almost immediately in shame.  James then picks up a call about the Green Square Hotel.  \u201cAttempted fraud.  A Simon Monkfort claimed for statues in suitcases\u2026\u201d  \u201cWhy is that our case?\u201d  Lewis looks perplexed.\u201cBecause I was there\u2026 and Jenni, the receptionist, actually asked him about the suitcases.\u201d James explains.\u201cSo, from attempted fraud to actual fraud?  What do we know about the man?\u201d  Lewis asks, all professional.\u201cNot a lot yet, I\u2019ve got Gurpreet on the case.\u201d  Staring at a screen would not help him right now.  He reaches for his Guide\u2019s wrist.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a hangover.\u201d\u201cAnd you need to ground\u2026\u201d  Robbie doesn\u2019t even finish the sentence before he closes the door to their office and pulls down the blinds.  He unbuttons his shirt and sits down on his desk.  \u201cYes.\u201dJames manages to sit in such a way that he can hear Robbie\u2019s heart beat a slow rhythm.  It soothes him like nothing else.  Taking a deep breath, he coughs.  Flowers, Robbie has held flowers, tightly to him.  \u201cFlowers\u2026\u201d\u201cOh yeah\u2026 I went to Val\u2019s grave, it\u2019s her birthday.\u201d  Robbie explains and James ignores the stab of pain that pushes through him.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened.\u201d\u201cHe just left her there on the pavement and drove off\u2026 a week before Christmas.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s head drops and James steps back into his reach.  \u201cI still get a letter from the DS, now a DI every year on her birthday.  It came yesterday.\u201dIt might explain why Robbie hadn\u2019t insisted on him coming to his home last night. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d  Sorry you still miss her.  Sorry I\u2019ll never be her.  There\u2019s nothing else he can say.James concentrates on the heartbeat again, this time it\u2019s faster.  \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d  He whispers the words and hopes it\u2019s enough.*****\nRobbie hurts but to his surprise, James\u2019 last words help.  He\u2019s not alone.  Val wouldn\u2019t want him to be alone.\u201cThanks.\u201d  The word escapes Robbie\u2019s mouth before he can stop himself.  \u201cI want to kill him\u2026 after she died, there was nothing left.  My family scattered, my work was gone.\u201dRobbie\u2019s amazed that James doesn\u2019t run away but holds him tighter.Taking a deep breath, Robbie calms himself.  Thankfully James is quiet and doesn\u2019t respond to his outburst.\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d  The door opens and Laura stares at them.  \u201cI\u2019ll come back later.\u201d\u201cNo, wait.\u201d  Robbie fastens the buttons on his shirt and in the corner, James does the same.  \u201cYou wanted us for something?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I don\u2019t think your boyfriend did it.  Not in the way he said he killed her.\u201d  Laura explains, waving a piece of paper at them.  \u201cWhat, how?\u201d  James sounds confused.  \u201cPeter Roberts sat there, telling me he\u2019d done it.\u201d\u201cHe may have, but if he told you he strangled her\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s his story.\u201d  James confirms, looking his usual cool self again and Robbie envies him for that.  He is sure his own looks aren\u2019t anywhere near as neat.\u201cJames, you investigate Rebecca\u2019s background again, try and find other suspect.  I\u2019ll talk to Peter again.\u201d  Despite everything, Robbie needs some time away from James, otherwise he\u2019d do something stupid. \u201cOf course, Sir.\u201d******\nJames takes a deep breath when he is alone. Laura has left with Robbie and it gives him a moment to compose himself.  Of course, Val Lewis\u2019s birthday\u2026 he had remembered and anticipated it would affect his Guide.  \u201cChristmas is going to be fun\u2026\u201d he whispers to himself.The door opens and Fiona walks in.  \u201cSorry, I listened.\u201dJames is torn between feeling invaded and grateful that she\u2019s done that so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with this by himself.\u201cNot sure if I should say thanks\u2026 or feel\u2026\u201d\u201cWe are both Sentinels, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never dialled up your hearing when thrown out of a room.\u201d  She laughs.  \u201cYou know better than that.\u201d\u201cTrue.  Well, then at least I don\u2019t have to talk.\u201d  James grimaces wryly.  \u201cDo you have some time to help?  I\u2019ve got this other case and the guy gave me the creeps when I met him.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.  Which one do you want me to do?  Gardner has got another DS she\u2019s started training, I\u2019m a bit surplus to requirements.\u201d  Fiona admits. \u201cJust why would Innocent want me around?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but right now I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here.  By the way, how is your head?\u201d\u201cNot as bad as yours, by the sounds of it.  Did you have lunch?\u201d  She asks just after James\u2019s stomach rumbles loudly.\u201cNo.\u201d  The realisation stuns James.  He\u2019d not even noticed and it\u2019s unlike Robbie not to send him out to get one.  James has actually started preparing sandwiches but after a night at a hotel, that one didn\u2019t happen.\u201cLet\u2019s go.  Gurpreet, can you start a search on Rebecca Ferguson?  The victim from this morning?\u201d\u201cOf course, and I\u2019ve got your file on Simon Monkton as well.  Did you know he has a Met file as well?  I\u2019ve sent you the link.\u201d  Gurpreet is all cheerful and James can\u2019t do much more than nod \u201cthank you.\u201d He takes the file and goes back into the empty office, ignoring Fiona\u2019s exasperated look.  If he\u2019s lucky, she\u2019ll turn up with a sandwich in a bit.  If not, an empty stomach has never bothered him before.  Fasting taught him that even though it\u2019s been a few years.Suddenly a date springs out at him\u2026. 19 December\u2026 London\u2026 blue car\u2026 stopped for damage in the hood which he\u2019d explained away with driving into a bollard.  A bollard\u2026 and they\u2019d believed him.  Arrested him for another attempted fraud and jailed him\u2026He picks up the phone and asks the switchboard to put him through to a DI Lestrade at the London Metropolitan Police.  \u201cDI Lestrade\u2026\u201d\u201cYes... good afternoon.  My name is DS James Hathaway, Oxford CID.  I\u2019m calling regarding a case from five years ago.  Val Lewis\u2026 wife of my Gui\u2026 DI Robert Lewis.\u201d\u201cI remember.  You\u2019ve got a development?\u201d  There is surprised in the voice.  \u201cI had my best man on that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got him here, in custody for another fraudulent attempt.  And who the hell accepted: I hit a bollard?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have a word.  Anderson, you need to double check your findings. Yes, a case we ballsed up.  DI from Oxford.  And no, this time it\u2019s not Sherlock\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to him\u2026\u201d  James threatens.  \u201cNot Anderson\u2026 he\u2019s in enough trouble as is.\u201d  DI Lestrade sounds angry.  \u201cNo, Simon Monkfort\u2026\u201d  James shivers in anger. \u201cGet your DCS to contact mine, if you need more.\u201d  DI Lestrade offers and James agrees that he will do so. They end the call and James makes his way to DCS Innocent\u2019s office.  Sandra smiles at him and ushers him in without making him wait.\u201cJames, what can I do for you?\u201d  The smile doesn\u2019t meet her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve got to talk to you.  Do you know what date it is?\u201d\u201cWhy?  Have I missed something?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Val\u2019s birthday.  And I think I\u2019ve found the drink driver who killed her.\u201d  James grips the back of the chair as he stands before her desk.  She hadn\u2019t given him permission to sit.  \u201cCan you prove it?\u201d  DCS Innocent stands up and paces.\u201cI think so, but I want the bastard to confess.\u201d  James admits. \u201cBest way.  I\u2019ll come with you.  Does Robbie know?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I want to be sure.  He\u2019s heartbroken as it is.\u201d  James\u2019s voice is low and he hates the look of pity in her eyes.\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t accepted the full bond?\u201d\u201cNo, he is still \u2018conserving\u2019 me.  I could ease his pain, but he won\u2019t let me close.\u201d  James admits.  Not close enough anyway.\u201cDo you want me to find you a better guide?  You know DCS Norrell from the Met would love to help.  Said there\u2019s always a place there for you.\u201d  DCS Innocent offers and for a moment it is appealing. \u201cNo, thank you.  Can we see Simon Monkfort now?  You may need to do the asking, I\u2019m not sure how calm I can stay.\u201dShe nods.  \u201cShow me the file.\u201d******\nIt is almost too easy.  Simon Monkfort folds like a deck of cards when confronted with the evidence.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.  But I couldn\u2019t stay.  I\u2019ve been feeling guilty for the last five years.\u201d There are tears in his eyes but James doesn\u2019t believe them for a second.  \u201cAnd my Guide has been grieving.\u201d  James stands up straight and looms over the cowering coward.  \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 get to feel anything.  She deserved better.\u201d\u201cJames, wait outside.  I will get Mr Monkfort to sign the confession and then refer this to the CPS.  Talk to Robbie.\u201dJames confirms that he will.  In the large office, he speaks to Gurpreet: \u201cDo you know where DI Lewis is?\u201d\u201cHow can you not know?  His Sentinel?  Shouldn\u2019t you know\u2026\u201d  Gurpreet laughs, it\u2019s a standing joke.  His laughter fades when he sees James\u2019s face.  \u201cHe called in, has gone home, I couldn\u2019t give him any information on the case.\u201dThe decision is an easy one.  James stops at a fish and chips shop, orders their favourites and then drives out to Robbie\u2019s flat.  Whilst he waits to be served, he texts Fiona to apologise for running out on her.Using his key, James lets himself into the flat.  The hallway is dark but he can see a sliver of light coming from the living room.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d  Robbie\u2019s greeting is hostile and James\u2019s heart hurts.\u201cWe need to talk.  I have news.  And you need to eat.\u201d  With that pronouncement, James deposits the paper bags on the table and walks to the kitchen where he collects plates, cutlery and a couple of glasses of water.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Gurpreet, there are no news.\u201d\u201cNot about that.\u201d James sits down on the sofa and opens the papers, depositing chips and fishes on plates.\u201cSimon Monkfort is the drunk driver.\u201d  James bursts out.  \u201cHe killed your Val.\u201dFocussing on Robbie, James notices that his Guide\u2019s breathing hitches and tears fill his eyes. \u201cAre you sure?  Are you really sure?  How did you find out?\u201d\u201cI am sure.  DCS Innocent has a written confession.  I read his file.  They booked him the same day, for fraud.  Didn\u2019t make the connection between the damage to his car and the accident.  Some idiot accepted a story of driving into bollards.  Too keen on fraud conviction.\u201d\u201cI want to see him!\u201d  Robbie leaps out of his chair.  \u201cI want to kill the bastard.\u201dJames stands up himself and steps to hold his Guide.  \u201cI know.  But if I let you go now, he\u2019d be in the morgue \u2013 yes, I know he deserves to be there \u2013 but then I\u2019d have to arrest you.  I\u2019m not sure Val would want that.\u201d \u201cHow do you know, what Val wanted?  She didn\u2019t have a chance to meet you. To meet Lyn\u2019s new baby.\u201dJames reels.  Lyn pregnant.  His guide a grandfather.  The age gap feels more acute than ever.  But James pushes that thought aside.  He can\u2019t give up on the bond, not now, not ever.\u201cYou can see him tomorrow.  Tonight you eat, you drink and you tell me about her\u2026 them.\u201d  James offers and heads to the kitchen where he knows there is a stash of Newcastle Brown Ale.  \u201cYou\u2019re right.  I hate it when you\u2019re right.\u201d When James returns to the living room, Robbie sits deflated on the sofa, picking on his chips. \u201cNot that you acknowledge that often.  I\u2019m honoured.\u201d  James hands over the beer and sits down next to his Guide.\u201cTell me, what did you do for her birthdays?\u201d******\nRobbie\u2019s head is hurting.  He is lying in his bed and there is someone breathing.  For a moment he wonders why Morse is in bed with him, when he remembers.  It can\u2019t be Morse, or Val.  Robbie tries to turn his head and manages, even though the world is spinning.\u201cWhat?\u201d  Robbie\u2019s voice croaks out.\u201cGood morning.\u201d  James\u2019s voice greets him, speaking softly.  \u201cYou drank last night, so I put you to bed.\u201dRobbie can\u2019t remember.  But James is in his bed and he wants to reach for him.  \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d  Again, softly asked.  \u201cI needed to look after you in case you threw up\u2026 and your sofa is too short.\u201dThat makes sense, James\u2019 lanky frame wouldn\u2019t fit.  \u201cI\u2019ll make a coffee.\u201dThis feels all wrong, shouldn\u2019t it be Robbie looking after James?  Instead he just says, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe hot shower revives Robbie and he reaches for the Sentinel friendly shower gel.  It soaps up but doesn\u2019t smell of anything.  He\u2019s got no clue how they did that, but Robbie actually likes it.  He\u2019d hated that fashion of the 90\u2019s where it was expected of men to smell of something other than what they really did. He\u2019d felt sorry for Morse and any other Sentinel at the time.  To Robbie\u2019s dismay, his dick is hard and wants attention.  Even if nothing happened with James (and he\u2019s sure it hasn\u2019t)\u2026 his body craves his Sentinel.  His body\u2019s betrayal is hard to take, wanting but his mind misses Val and Morse.  Robbie turns the water as cold as possible and shivers until his erection is taken care of.He dresses quickly in one of his suits and puts a tie on.  With his armour firmly in place, Robbie, joins James in the kitchen.  \u201cThank you.\u201d  He takes the cup of coffee and takes a deep drink.  The bitterness wakes him up and he follows it with the two aspirin he is handed by James.  \u201cThanks, lad.\u201d  He repeats himself.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to DCS Innocent.  She can have Monkfort transported to court and jail before we get back to the station.\u201dRobbie thinks about that.  \u201cNo\u2026 I need to see him.\u201dThis is a monster he can face.  Morse died from a heart attack, alone, in a college courtyard \u2013 caused by too much beer and one too many takeaways.  Nothing they could have done, but Val, that had been senseless.  \u201cNo, I want to see him.  I have to.\u201d******\nJames drives.  Robbie is silent as the approach the station.  Before leaving, James had called DCS Innocent and informed her of the plans.  She greets them at the steps up to the entrance.\u201cRobbie, are you sure?\u201d  This is the first time that James has seen DCS Innocent caring for either of them.\u201cYes\u2026 I have to.\u201d\u201cOkay, and then you and James have the rest of the day off.  DI Gardner and DS Summers have taken the Rebecca Ferguson case.\u201dRobbie should feel upset about it but he knows that he\u2019s no good to anyone in his condition and it\u2019s going to get worse.  \u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve put him interrogation room three.\u201dThey walk silently through the corridors and down the stairs.  James steps in front of him and Robbie acquiesces.  A barrier might be good.\u201cWhat do you want now, DS Hathaway?\u201d  Simon Monkfort sounds peeved.  \u201cWhy am I still here?  I\u2019ve told you everything.\u201d\u201cI want you to meet someone.  This is my Guide, Detective Inspector Lewis.  You killed his wife on that day.\u201dIt\u2019s almost comical when Simon Monkfort falls back into his chair and puts his hands up as if surrendering.  \u201cI am sorry.  So sorry.  I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201dRobbie just stares at him.  This is not a monster, this is a pathetic worm who hasn\u2019t admitted to killing a woman until he\u2019d been caught out.  By James and not this famous consulting detective everyone is talking about. Without saying a word, Robbie turns and walks along the dark corridors back to the stairs.  He hears a door lock and James speak to the police officer standing guard outside.\u201cWhere do you want to go, Sir?\u201d  James asks and for Robbie there is only one answer.\u201cThe cemetary\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, it would be.\u201d  James replies and Robbie thinks he\u2019s missing something.  *****\nThings don\u2019t change a lot, despite James\u2019s hope, the ghosts of Robbie\u2019s past still haunting their lives.  The only change is that occasionally James stays over now ever so often when their grounding sessions draw longer and longer.  He gets to sleep in the same bed as his Guide, and cherishes the rest that brings.Fiona leaves for London the day of James\u2019s 31st birthday.   It means he doesn\u2019t spend the day with Robbie but helps her move.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out celebrating?\u201d  Fiona asks when he arrives in the morning.\u201cCelebrate what?  Another year older?  That I\u2019ve waited almost a year for my Guide to see sense which he never will?\u201d  James is amazed at how pained he sounds as he packs one of her boxed into the hired van.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you get out then?\u201d  It\u2019s a sensible question James has asked himself often enough.  Then he wakes up next to Robbie and for a moment there is peace.  The idea of never experiencing that again\u2026 it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201cWould be sensible, but since when is love sensible?  If I was, I\u2019d have long gone.\u201d  James admits.  \u201cI could have gone to\u2026\u201d  He interrupts himself, doesn\u2019t want to hurt his friend.\u201cGo to London\u2026 of course I knew.\u201d  Fiona grimaces for a second but then puts a smile back on. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t lie that well.  And if you weren\u2019t in love with your Guide, I\u2019d have picked you up for a few nights of fun.  I pay attention, makes me a great DS.\u201d  Fiona makes light of it and James lets her.  \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a present for you.\u201dShe hands him a small parcel and a card.\u201cHappy Birthday, Jim.\u201d \u201cNever\u2026 never ever call me that!\u201d  James shudders and concentrates on the small parcel instead.  It holds a gift voucher for an online book store and a chocolate cake.\u201cI hope we can have that with a coffee in London this afternoon.\u201d  She smiles and this time it\u2019s genuine. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d  James puts the card in his bag and goes back to packing the van he\u2019s hired for the day. ****** The next morning James is back at work.  Robbie hasn\u2019t commented on his birthday and their conversation over the latest body is cursory despite it being a ten year old boy.  Even Laura makes a comment on it:\u201cHow can you stand him when he\u2019s like that?\u201d\u201cSuffering and endurance, the bedrock of a happy marriage.\u201d  James quips bitterly.\u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d\u201cMy family\u2026.\u201d  James admits before concentrating on the case.  The boy deserves it.*****\n\u201cWhere\u2019s James?\u201d  Laura asks Robbie a few months later.\u201cIn court, the case with the boy.\u201d  \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you there?\u201d  Laura\u2019s question is fair.\u201cJames solved it, I wasn\u2019t really needed.  He has all the details.\u201d  Robbie explains.  \u201cCPS thought a Sentinel would make more of an impact on the witness stand.\u201d\u201cHey, you are as needed as he is.\u201d  Laura disagrees.\u201cWell, not this time.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t write yourself off.\u201d  Laura exhorts.  \u201cI\u2019m sure he needs you.\u201d\u201cThat is rubbish.  I\u2019m too old for him.  Why doesn\u2019t he find himself a real Guide?\u201d\u201cWhat if you\u2019re his \u2018real\u2019 Guide?\u201d  Laura has heard the rumours.  \u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish\u2026 I\u2019d be on the junk heap already if he\u2019d not asked for me.  Innocent was quite happy to cart me off to the training academy.\u201d  Robbie is bitter.  \u201cAnd if he ever finds his Guide, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll end up.\u201d\u201cOh, Robbie.\u201d  Laura gives him a quick hug.  \u201cI love you.\u201d******\nJames walks down the steps outside the court building,  feeling drained.  Memories from the past are churning through his mind and realisations are falling into place.\u201cThere you are lad, how did it go?\u201d  Robbie is outside waiting for him and James has to hold himself back from reaching out and making his Guide hold him.  He just shakes his head.\u201cNot good, sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, it went well, I\u2019m pretty sure there is no doubt in the juror\u2019s minds.\u201d  James explains.  \u201cCan we find a private space?\u201d\u201cSorry, lad, we\u2019ve got a case.  DCS Innocent just called, Laura\u2019s at the scene.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s explanation is wearying but James at least manages some contact with Robbie\u2019s wrist which settles him a bit.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d \u201cSt Mark\u2019s church\u2026  in front of the altar.  I\u2019ll need your knowledge.\u201d  Robbie admits.James understands what he means.  Faith is not something they share.  \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAre you okay, lad?\u201dJames lies.  \u201cOf course.  It was a tough morning.  I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cGood.  I\u2019m sorry you had to relive that.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s words soothe James a bit.  The feeling doesn\u2019t last long.  Robbie drives and James has no excuse to keep him close.  The murder scene is one of the more gruesome ones and James has to dial down his smell.  Blood is splattered over the altar.\u201cJames, talk to the priest.  I\u2019m with Laura.\u201d  James nods, grateful to escape the macabre scene.  Father Desmond King is shaken but helpful.  \u201cWill, Will McEwan, that\u2019s who it was.  Came in a few times.  Confession, you know?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d  James is shocked.  The name rings a bell and from what he\u2019s seen, he should know the man.  \u201cWhere does he live?\u201d\u201cCrevecoeur.\u201dJames falls to the floor, overwhelmed as his past collides with his present.  The metallic smell of his friend\u2019s blood, the splattered brain matter, a roaring in his ears all combine to make James lose connection.  He wants to go out there and kill the murderer but his legs buckle on him and he can\u2019t move, can\u2019t go after him.  Just like last time...\u201cJames, come back, James, you are here, with me.\u201d  The first thing James notices is that he\u2019s sitting up and leaning against a naked chest.  Robbie\u2019s heart is beating a storm as his Guide cradles him.  \u201cJames, open your eyes, let me see you.  I\u2019m here.  You\u2019re safe.  I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d  \u201cI think he\u2019s coming round.\u201d  A female voice, Laura he think.  \u201cHas he zoned on you before?\u201d\u201cNo, not really.  James, can you stand?  We\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d  Robbie asks and James shakes his head.  If he opens his eyes, he\u2019ll see Will again, dead.  \u201cCan\u2019t see him. Friend.\u201d\u201cLaura, can you cover up Will so we don\u2019t destroy any evidence?\u201d  \u201cGive me a bit of time.  Shouldn\u2019t be a problem though.\u201d Laura\u2019s reassurance is quickly given.  He hears her rustle and James imagines a tent but all he wants is to rest against his Guide.  He\u2019s scared to breathe in case the smell of blood pushes him over the edge again.\u201cPerfect, thank you Laura.\u201d His Guide\u2019s voice is gentle.  \u201cHow are you James?\u201d\u201cFriend, past... hurts.\u201d James stammers.  It\u2019s a jumble. \u201cI\u2019m here.  Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you through this.  Laura is calling for some backup.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give case... to Gardner.  Want...\u201d\u201cYou want us to solve this.  Of course.  I\u2019ll make sure.  Now, just lie here and listen to me.  It\u2019ll hurt, death does that.  But we\u2019ll find whoever did this.  And your past, well, I\u2019m old enough to say that there\u2019s not a lot that shocks me.\u201dJames shakes his head.  \u201cStay calm, listen to me.  Listen to my heart.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s hand strokes his head, pressing James\u2019s ear and face against the hairy chest.  His Guide had offered to shave for him but the hair had never bothered James.  It\u2019s soft enough, even now when its black is peppered with silver.  \u201cHe\u2019s covered, if you want to go outside.  There\u2019s a bench at the entrance.\u201d  Laura softly intones and this time James feels up to moving.\u201cI\u2019ll get up first, then you follow.  Keep your eyes closed, I\u2019ll lead you.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s suggestion is a good one and James nods.  He feels bereft when the supportive chest leaves him and he can hear rustling as Robbie closes his shirt.\u201cStand up for me.  I\u2019ve got you.  You\u2019re safe.\u201d  Robbie repeats himself and James follows the voice.  Strong hands hold him tight as they step out through a side entrance and don\u2019t go past the body again.  Once outside, James takes a deep breath of fresh air.  The flowers are almost overwhelming but Robbie\u2019s strong hand holds him in place.  \u201cStay here.  Can I leave you?  I need to...\u201dIt\u2019s a case, of course Robbie has to leave.  James knows that but it doesn\u2019t stop it hurting.  And what is Will doing here?  He\u2019d been gone for years. \u201cHe\u2019s your friend, you can tell me about him later, I want to make sure we don\u2019t lose any evidence.  You sit here. Remember him alive.\u201dJames has no choice in that matter.  Will\u2019s parents will be destroyed.   Their only child is dead.  And James will never be able to apologise to Will now.  The row had been epic and hurtful. \u201cWhat do you know?  I wish I was a Sentinel!  Nobody would bat a bloody eyelid if you turned to a man.  My family will disown me.\u201d  \u201cWhy would I want a man?  I\u2019m not gay.  It\u2019s wrong.\u201d  James had been in full denial then.  \u201cI\u2019m not wrong.  Feardocha is not wrong.\u201d Will had denied James\u2019s assertion.  \u201cGod made us this way.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.  A Sentinel can\u2019t choose it, you can.\u201d  Oh, James had been so indoctrinated then.  Father Michael at the Seminary had been preaching over and over about it.  And he\u2019d believed it.A decade later and so many things have changed.  James has grown up and changed.   He\u2019s found love and heartbreak\u2026 with a man.  And he doesn\u2019t care what Father Michael would make of it.  \u201cI\u2019m back, lo\u2026 lad.  It\u2019s all under control.  Gurpreet is checking in on family and nearest and dearest.\u201d\u201cI need to go\u2026 his parents, they love\u2026 loved him so much.\u201d  James can\u2019t believe Will is gone.\u201cIt looks like a suicide.\u201d Robbie\u2019s words rock James and he is glad he is sitting down.\u201cNo, he would never do that.  And definitely not in a church.\u201d  That much James is sure of.  \u201cWill and I were in Seminary, together.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s assume then someone did it.  Laura will confirm.  Come on, lad.\u201d  Robbie holds him and James concentrates on his Guide. James makes himself get up.  Robbie\u2019s arms are safe and James regulates his breathing.  In and out, in an out, the same as Robbie.  The rhythm calms him and now James can face it.  Will\u2019s parents deserve to hear the horrible news from him. \u201cCan I get you a glass of water?\u201d  Father King offers but James declines. \u201cThank you.  Can you keep this quiet?  Don\u2019t want there to be rumours.\u201d  No way would Will kill himself.  \u201cOf course.  As quiet as I can.\u201d  James nods.  It\u2019s not as if a body in the chancel isn\u2019t fodder for the rumour mill already. \u201cI\u2019m driving.  You can give me directions.  Where is the Crevecoeur?\u201d  Robbie\u2019s voice brooks no opposition. \u201cA couple of miles off the road by Godstow and Wytham.\u201d  James remembers the building so well.  His mother had worked as a housekeeper for the family, being able to live in, she\u2019d saved money.  James still had needed grants to go to University but Cambridge had welcomed him with open arms.  After graduation, he\u2019d been able to keep rowing even though Seminary should have meant hiding from the world and James had loved it.  Will and Feardocha had never understood his desire to put an unseen God they didn\u2019t believe in over people.  It had been peaceful until he\u2019d come online during the winning boat race.  The rowing practice had been hard but so worth it.  Throwing their cox into the Thames had been the best experience ever.    The celebrations had been epic, Will, Feardocha and James had joined the team for a pub crawl.  It had been James\u2019s first but that was not something he\u2019d ever admit.   It would be the last.  \u201cAre you okay, lad?\u201d  Robbie\u2019s question interrupts James\u2019s musings.\u201d\u201cMemories\u2026 Will had been at my first zone out.  Feardocha talked me out of it.\u201d  James explains, memories swirling.\u201cWho was Feardocha?\u201d\u201cAnother friend.  I grew up at Crevecoeur and Will brought Feardocha back from boarding school.  I went locally.\u201d\u201cAnd what happened?\u201dAnd only a few short years later, he\u2019d lost their friendship.  \u201cNothing.\u201d  Robbie lets him be but James can\u2019t help thinking back.  Feardocha and Will had challenged him over and over but James had been adamant, and cruel.\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care.  The church teaches...\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a member of their church, I am their son!\u201d  Will had pointed out.  \u201cWhy can\u2019t they love me as I am?  Why don\u2019t you accept me as I am?\u201dJames had been quiet.  What could he have said?  After all he\u2019d been in denial about himself for years.  Only falling in love with his Guide had stopped that but there is no way that James will say that out loud\u2026 ever.*****\nRobbie is convinced that his Sentinel is not telling the whole truth but he doesn\u2019t pry.  Instead he concentrates on driving.  He stops the car in a layby a couple of miles outside Godstow.  \u201cWhat do I need to know?\u201d  James\u2019s wrist feels cold under his hand and Robbie wishes\u2026, well, if wishes were horses, he\u2019d be able to race the Grand National all on his own.\u201cWill McEwan, same age as me, only son of William and Maggie McEwan.  Went to Eton and read Business Studies at Cambridge whilst I read religious studies.  My mother was the housekeeper at Crevecoeur.  She was fired just after I went to Cambridge.\u201dThat could be a problem. \u201cHow was your relationship with them?\u201d\u201cIt was fine\u2026 until I left for seminary.  I had a fight with Will ten years ago.  I\u2019ve got no idea what he told them.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do the talking then.\u201d  Robbie is worried about James\u2019s fragility.  His Sergeant is putting up a front again.  \u00a0******\nWill McEwan Senior stays stoic when Robbie breaks the news that his only son is dead.  Maggie McEwan distracts herself by making tea.\u201cJames, do you still take it white, no sugar?\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.  It\u2019s coffee now, lots of milk.\u201d  The milk cools the coffee and makes it less bitter, Robbie knows.  \u201cMilk in first, please.\u201d  Robbie wants to scowl at his Sentinel but anything to prevent another zone out.  \u201cI know this is hard, but what can you tell me about Will?\u201dThat opens the flood gates.  Will\u2019s father tells them in between fighting back tears:\u201cHe\u2019s just come back from spending years in Brazil.  Worked for a charity there.  Zoe\u2026 oh dear, we need to tell Zoe.  She\u2019s going to be heartbroken.\u201d\u201cWho is Zoe?\u201d  James asks as if he hasn\u2019t heard that name before.  Robbie files \u201cWill\u2019s girlfriend\u2026 he met her in Brazil.\u201dRobbie makes a note.  \u201cDo you know her surname?\u201d\u201cWatson, Zoe Watson.\u201d  Mrs McEwan re-joins them with a tray and hands out the drinks.  \u201cShe\u2019s lovely.  Gone to visit her parents, Will said.\u201dOnly now do tears start running down her eyes and in no time at all she is sobbing against her husband\u2019s shoulder.  Robbie cuts the interview short and leaves his card as he ushers James back to the car.  The drive to the station is silent as Robbie tries to put the pieces together.  He doesn\u2019t have a handle on the motive yet, the cursory search of Will\u2019s room hadn\u2019t given him anything. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home.  You need to rest.  I\u2019ll check in with Innocent and come back to you.\u201d  Robbie makes the decision.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d  James doesn\u2019t disagree and Robbie takes him to his flat.  \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d******\nJames shivers as he climbs into bed.  Robbie never came back and he feels out of sorts.  Laura had popped by and checked in on him.  James had lied and told her he was fine.  Sleep escapes James but he pretends all is in order when Robbie collects him to start work the next morning.  Coffee helps and they manage to find Zoe Watson.   Gurpreet\u2019s wizardry on such things amazes even James who is usually quite adept at them. \u201cHe\u2019s dead?  Really?\u201d  Zoe doesn\u2019t burst into the expected tears which moves her high up James\u2019s suspect list.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.  We told his parents yesterday.\u201d  \u201cOf course, thank you, Sentinel.\u201d  James rocks back into the chair she has offered him.  She\u2019s a Guide and he hadn\u2019t picked it up.  Her hand is soft on his and for a moment James feels calmer.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the bad news.  James, we need to leave.  Miss Watson, please remain available.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s all business as he turns to leave.  He puts his phone in his pocket and James checks his own.  There is nothing.James wants to stay and reaches for one of his business cards.  \u201cIf you remember anything that could help, please call me.\u201dOnce outside her flat, James feels as if he can\u2019t breathe.  He leans forward, staring at the unmoving tarmac as he listens to Robbie. \u201cJames, we need to go to the rectory\u2026 Father King has been found dead.\u201dJames nods and goes in autopilot once they arrive \u2026 shutting down his smell as they examine the body.  Cause of death is very obvious, a knife through the heart.  The knife has not been left but there is no exit wound as from a bullet.\u201cWhy would they kill him?  And is it linked to yesterday?\u201d  Robbie muses out loud and James tries to think but it\u2019s difficult.  Laura looks at James funny but doesn\u2019t say anything.  Instead she orders the crime scene investigation team to come in.\u201cNothing else you can do.\u201d\u201cJames, you speak to the Bishop.  I\u2019m going back to the station.  We need to find links.\u201d  Nodding, James acquiesces.  *****\nRobbie misses James but splitting up makes sense as they tackle this case.  They meet in the evening to compare notes before Robbie goes home.  James claims that he can\u2019t come over and Robbie gets the feeling that James wants some space.  The case drags on and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a motive or connection beyond a leaflet they found relating to group they can\u2019t find.  James is obsessed with finding Feardocha, his friend from university and Robbie can\u2019t help him.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the last record his him getting a passport eight years ago.  Then he vanishes.\u201d  Gurpreet has tried hard to find a record.\u201cCome on lad, let\u2019s go home.  Dinner and a film. We\u2019ll be luckier tomorrow.\u201d  Robbie offers.  He knows he\u2019s got a couple of pizzas in the freezer, so dinner should be sorted.\u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m\u2026 meeting someone\u2026 a Guide.\u201d  The words are spoken quRobbie should feel relief\u2026 this was only ever temporary.  Instead there is a feeling of dread in his stomach.  Taking a deep breath, Robbie nods his acquiescence.  \u201cGo, I\u2019ll see you in the morning.  I\u2019m going over the paperwork again.\u201d Robbie will need the distraction. \u201cOf course.\u201d  James leaves and Robbie is lost.  Robbie\u2019s search is fruitless.  The names Feardocha, Zoe, Will\u2026 all merge together.  Gurpreet pins down a couple more time lines and it feels like an invasion in James\u2019 privacy.  Will left a few months before James left the Seminary.  Flights to Brazil were booked in the names of Will McEwan and Feardocha Tanner.  \u201cGuv, that doesn\u2019t make any sense.  I\u2019ve got flights back, but they changed the name from Feardocha Watson to Zoe Watson.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t be the same person, can it?\u201d  Robbie\u2019s brain is working overtime.  There must be a link.  \u201cFeardocha was registered a Guide\u2026\u201d  DCS Innocent\u2019s voice makes Robbie jump.  \u201cTalking of which, where is your Sentinel?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d  And Robbie hadn\u2019t asked.  He\u2019s not about to admit that he\u2019s going to be replaced.  He wonders what DCS Innocent is doing here but before he can ask, they get interrupted. \u201cSir, there is a fire reported at the address we have for Zoe Watson.\u201d  Gurpreet shouts out. Suddenly the puzzle pieces fit and the whole picture emerges. \u201cJAMES!\u201d  Robbie reaches for his keys and runs.  He has never abused blue lights, but tonight he is grateful that he can break the speed limit with impunity.There are flames and smoke and mad woman standing in the door to a bedroom containing his Sentinel.\u201cHe killed Will\u2026 he made me kill Will.  I became Zoe and yet there was no life.\u201d  She rants and raves and Robbie wants to listen but all he knows is that if they don\u2019t get out of here, they die..  Robbie has enough.   He picks up the unconscious James and carries him out of the building.  She follows them out.  \u201cHe has no clue, I am life.  Through fire, there will be life.\u201d  \u201cAnd ambulance will be here any minute.\u201d  Jean Innocent informs Robbie.  \u201cYou can debrief me later.\u201dRobbie holds his Sentinel, never noticing  Zoe / Feardocha running into the fire and perishing as the building burns.******\nRobbie\u2019s back aches.  The hospital chair is hard under his arse but there is no way he\u2019s moving from it.  Doctors and nurses have bustled around, taken bloods, given James oxygen and now he\u2019s sleeping.Robbie closes his own eyes, falling into troubled dreams.  He\u2019s in a wood, surrounded by tall dark trees.  A small brook is running alongside him as he walks.  Birds are singing. Robbie stops when he sees a badger being nuzzled by a deer.  Frozen in place, Robbie stares, realisation dawning.  In the distance a moose with crown of small white and purple flowers nods and steps away.  It feels like a blessing.  Robbie looks again at his spirit animal playing with James\u2019s\u2026 happily ignoring everything around them.  The deer is running and hopping, always coming back to the badger who is ambling almost sedentary along the brook.  It should not have worked, but Robbie\u2019s heart fills with joy at the sight. Suddenly they move off, running quickly alongside the small river, following the water flow.  Robbie wants to follow but instead he wakes up.  James is coughing and Robbie reaches out with his hand.\u201cYou\u2019re safe.  I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re safe now.\u201d\u201cZoe\u2026 Feard...\u201d James\u2019s voice is scratchy.\u201cYes, you can talk later. I\u2019m sorry, I let you down.\u201d Robbie can\u2019t help but admit, knowing James might not get it.\u201cShe, he, drugs.\u201d\u201cYes, she did.\u201d  Robbie moves from the chair, ignoring his hurting back and manages to lie down on the bed next to his Sentinel.\u201cTried to kill me.\u201d\u201cYes, and I got you out, Sentinel.\u201d  Robbie kisses James gently on the cheek.  \u201cAnd when you are out of here\u2026 if you still want me\u2026 we close this bond.\u201d*****\nJames has never fought so hard to get out of hospital as he has after his Guide\u2019s gentle words which had been followed by their first kiss.  The three days have crawled by despite visits by Laura and DCS Innocent.  Robbie hadn\u2019t left his side unless ordered by either the doctors or his DCS.  James has never felt so cossetted and yet, there was still a hole in him that needed filling.If his body wasn\u2019t still aching from the injuries and breathing a chore, he\u2019d be skipping out of here.\u201cSlowly, lad.  We\u2019ll get home soon enough.\u201d  Robbie admonishes him gently.Home.  That\u2019s what James needs.  \u201cYou\u2019re my home.\u201d  \u201cYou still on the good drugs?\u201d  But there is no heat in the question and instead James is kissed on the cheek.  James decides not to answer.The drive is silent, James is concentrating on not hyperventilating as he tries to relax in the back seat.  His dream is about to come true.  They have talked about the bonding whilst James was in hospital.\u201cDid you mean that?\u201d  It had taken forty eight hours before James\u2019s brain resembled something of a normal one.\u201cYes, Sentinel.\u201d\u201cWe will need\u2026\u201d  James had flushed and never finished the sentence.\u201cWe will have.\u201d  Robbie hadn\u2019t flushed which had let James wonder if his Sentinel has ever had sex with Morse.\u201cDid you ever?\u201d  James had asked.  Honesty was \u201cI\u2019ve been married.\u201d  Evasive, as usual. \u201cA man?\u201d\u201cNever kiss and tell\u2026\u201d  Jealousy had suffused James at the time.  He would never escape their ghosts, would he?\u201cHey, come back to me.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s hand is quickly put on his wrist and stays there, calming James inexplicably.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to be jealous.   They gave their blessing.\u201dFor a moment James wonders what Robbie means.  Then he remembers the drug induced dream.  \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a dream?  The moose?\u201d\u201cNo, and the flowers, Valerian.\u201dJames starts to laugh.  \u201cOh my God, really?  You\u2019re in the Newcastle United colours!\u201d\u201cYes, and you\u2019re a fleet footed deer who should skip more.\u201d\u201cNOBODY will ever find out about this conversation.\u201d  James bursts out.\u201cI promise, I won\u2019t tell.\u201d  Laura giggles from the driver seat.  \u201cThough it\u2019s about time.\u201dJames wants to swear but thankfully they have arrived at Robbie\u2019s flat.  It doesn\u2019t take long to transfer James and his bags into the small living room.\u201cHave a nice few days off.  See you soon.\u201d  Laura grins as she closes the door behind her.For a moment there is silence as the realisation of their new situation sinks in.  Then James just steps closer to his Guide and within seconds is held tightly.  After being held for what feels like an eternity, Robbie pulls away and James feels bereft.\u201cCome on, the bedroom will be more comfortable.  I got a new bed.\u201d  James hadn\u2019t known it, but the knowledge that this is not Robbie\u2019s old marital bed, is something that he\u2019d needed.  He\u2019d slept in it the few times he\u2019d been allowed to stay over but knowing it had been shared by Val had been a damper on his libido like nothing else could have. \u201cNobody\u2019s been in there.  It was delivered yesterday.\u201d And Robbie had spent the night with James at the hospital.   James follows Robbie silently, trying to calm his mind, unsuccessfully.  Once inside the bedroom, he stops a moment to take it in.  The walls are a plain beige with wooden wardrobe and dark blue curtains.  That is still the same.  But the bed has a soft blue headboard but no foot board now.  There are photos on a chest of drawers next to a TV, showing Robbie\u2019s family.  A new one has joined it.  James recognises it as a press cutting from one of their cases.  It shows them together.James\u2019s attention is drawn back to Robbie when his Guide steps closer to him and starts undressing, starting with the shirt.  This is familiar and James copies the motion.  The air is nice against his chest.  Robbie continues, sitting down on the bed, pulling off shoes and socks.  James sits down next to him and follows suit, making sure his socks are in the shoes.Last they take their trousers off and then their pants.  This is the first time James has seen Robbie naked and for a moment his brain short circuits.  The gentle kiss bestowed on his lips breaks the dam and suddenly all he can to is touch and kiss back and claim.\u201cLube\u2026\u201d  Robbie\u2019s voice cuts through the fog and James remembers what that means.  He lets Robbie go to the bedside table but follows closely.  He can\u2019t resist letting his hands hold Robbie\u2019s shoulders and stare at the arse.  James\u2019s cock rises and James is waiting for the usual feeling of shame.\u201cWow, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d  Robbie\u2019s turned around and looks at him.  He\u2019s holding a tube in his hand and James puts it on top of the night table.  They sit down on the bed again and this time James starts kissing Robbie.  He lets himself soak in the taste, sweet and succulent.  The smell is intoxicating and he can explore Robbie\u2019s body for the first time.  Robbie\u2019s hands stroke along James\u2019s back, pulling him closer and soon they lie sideways on the bed.  \u201cI\u2026 I must.\u201d James slides down the bed, slowly kissing down Robbie\u2019s chest until he gets to his prize.  Robbie\u2019s cock is hard and wide.  The first taste is orgasmic and James\u2019s brain explodes in colour.  Peace and order flood him and soon he can\u2019t stop.  He explores the globes below the hard flesh and even wanders further down.  Robbie knows what he needs and twists to give him better access.  The lube is cool and James uses as much as he can to prepare Robbie.*****\nRobbie can\u2019t believe he is letting James do this but the mouth on his cock is hot and arousing.  Flashes of an exciting, busy mind connect with his own and soon he can\u2019t wait to merge fully with his Sentinel.James\u2019s hands are busy and all Robbie can do is writhe and offer more.  He wants it all, no regrets beyond having waited so long.Leaning up, Robbie gets another kiss and soon thinking stops.  It burns when James enters him and Robbie makes himself relax.  The hand on his cock and the lips kissing him and the hot chest against his\u2026 all soothe and banish any lingering doubts.  Time stands still when they come together and the bond snaps into place as if it had been waiting to do that.\u201cMy Guide.\u201d\n\u201cMy Sentinel.\u201d  My only Sentinel, my love, my\u2026 everything.\u201cYou mean that?\u201d  James still seems to doubt him and Robbie doesn\u2019t mind that he\u2019s obviously said that out loud.\u201cYes \u2026 I\u2019m sorry I made you wait.\u201d\u201cWorth it.\u201d  James\u2019s words are muffled against Robbie\u2019s chest.  \u201cI love you too.\u201dDo happy ever afters exist?  Robbie isn\u2019t sure but the fact that he\u2019s got the chance at a second one is good enough for him. ******\nDetective Sergeant James Hathaway had volunteered to collect Detective Inspector Robert Lewis from Heathrow Airport.  His Guide has spent the weekend with his daughter and son to break the news of the bond and James had decided he wasn\u2019t suited for the evil stepmother role.The airport is noisy, at 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.  In the arrivals area, people are hugging and running towards each other.  James is holding up his old sign labelled \u2018Lewis\u2019.  The electronic arrivals board indicates that the flight landed half an hour ago and allowing for baggage collection, James thinks Robbie must be coming through soon.   He is proved right when a man in his fifties, dressed in a colourful Hawaiian shirt walks in, pushing a trolley covered in suitcases.  \u201cLyn, Mark, Thomas, this is James.\u201d  Suddenly James is surrounded by family hugging and welcoming him.\u201cThey wanted to come, I couldn\u2019t stop them.  And well, wanted to show you off.\u201d  The last is whispered in James\u2019s ear. James smiles.  Life is complete. Fin"}}}
